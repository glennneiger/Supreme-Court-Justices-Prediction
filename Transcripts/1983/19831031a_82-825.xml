            <text syncTime="28.330" offset="259875">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.750" offset="273563">Three terms ago this Court concluded in Federal Trade Commission versus Standard Oil Company of California that an administrative complaint should not be subjected to routine judicial review to determine whether it had been properly issued because such review necessarily resulted in undue delay in the resolution of the administrative proceeding, improperly subjected or rendered the prosecuting agency the Defendant at the very outset of its proceeding, and in the end resulted in unnecessary and piecemeal appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.358" offset="440015">Although this case arises in a somewhat different context, it presents a very similar issue, that is, whether there must be a trial and a consequent judicious or appellate review, with all the attendant delays, of the question whether or not a complaint under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been properly issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.442" offset="536355">The practical considerations that compelled this Court's result in the SOCAL case requires similar result here.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="105.283" offset="567702">Mr. Wilkins, you say that one of the issues here is whether there must be a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.720" offset="585465">Even in the days before the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were adopted and complaints were held to a fairly strict standard of pleading facts, I don't think there ever were trials with witnesses called.</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_g_wilkins" startTime="123.931" stopTime="267.183">
            <label>Mr. Richard G. Wilkins</label>
            <text syncTime="123.931" offset="642308">I misspoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.620" offset="645024">I meant some sort of a hearing, some sort of judicial probing into those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.210" offset="663415">On October 16, 1979, Eleanor Holmes North, who was then Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, issued a sworn Commissioner's complaint against the Respondent, Shell Oil Company, alleging unlawful employment practices of Shell's Wood River, Illinois, Refinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.360" offset="740006">Commissioner Norton stated that she had cause to believe that the Respondent had unlawfully excluded Blacks from managerial, professional, technical, office clerical craft, and service worker positions, and had similarly excluded women from managerial, professional, technical craft, operative labor, and service worker positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.461" offset="824433">A copy of the charge was duly filed on the Respondent, and it was subsequently amended to state that Commissioner Norton had reason to believe that the acts had occurred on a continuing basis since at least July 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.909" offset="874170">The Commission then began an investigation to determine whether there was reasonable cause to support the allegations of Commissioner Norton's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.841" offset="909906">The Commission, pursuant to Section 709(a) of the Act, requested the Respondent to provide certain employment information.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.920" offset="938223">The Respondent, on the basis of its own statistical analysis, refused, arguing that its employment practices did not...</text>
            <text syncTime="206.818" offset="973854">"Were clearly not the profile anticipated for a Commissioner's charge. "</text>
            <text syncTime="211.163" offset="991199">After informal methods of administrative investigation failed, the Commission filed a subpoena pursuant to Section 710, and the Respondent filed this action to squash the subpoena and enjoin the Commission's investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.842" offset="1053893">The Respondent argued that Commissioner Norton had not shown sufficient facts to form a basis for her allegations of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.164" offset="1087225">The District Court dismissed these factual specificity arguments as meritless and enforced the Commission's subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.429" offset="1116273">On appeal, the Eighth Circuit reversed, however, finding that there was indeed insufficient factual basis to support the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.863" offset="1150024">On denial of a hearing en banc, Chief Judge Lay of the Eighth District dissented, stating that the decision placed the circuit in direct conflict with the decisions of all other courts of appeal addressing the issue of factual allegations in a Title VII charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.824" offset="1221808">He was alone in the dissent as far as I am aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.117" offset="1239049">As noted by Chief Judge Lay, the single most significant characteristic of the decision below is that it does fly in the face of previously uniform precedent rejecting any factual pleading requirement for Title VII charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.252" offset="1307594">Indeed, since the decision below was rendered, two additional courts of appeals have looked at the question and have concluded that the factual pleading requirement created by the court below is inappropriate and is not in conformity with the Title VII enforcement scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.886" offset="1366108">This Court has recognized that Title VII creates an integrated, multi-step enforcement procedure culminating in the Commission's authority to bring an enforcement action in Federal Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.818" offset="1417831">Mr. Wilkins, I think that the Eighth Circuit relied on a particular provision of the Civil Rights Act, did it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="325.395" offset="1448133">Exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.175" offset="1451268">Section 707 of the Civil Rights Act authorizes the Commission to... authorizes a member of the Commission to file a complaint based upon a suspected pattern or practice of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.138" offset="1499124">Section 706(b) requires that that charge be in writing, under oath or affirmation, and contain such information and be in such form as the Commission requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.542" offset="1540711">Section 706(b) also requires that within ten days, the Commission serve a copy or a notice of the charge on the Respondent containing the date, place and circumstances of the alleged--</text>

            <text syncTime="366.035" offset="1610719">But the purpose of a charge, and the purpose of the notice of the charge under Section 706(b) have quite discrete and limited functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.438" offset="1644260">The charge does not begin in any sort of formal enforcement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.825" offset="1661815">It does not have, in the words of this Court's prior decisions involving similar issues,</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="387.525" offset="1696610">What has that got to do with the definition of the terms, date, place, and circumstances that Congress put in the Act.</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_g_wilkins" startTime="393.803" stopTime="448.315">
            <label>Mr. Richard G. Wilkins</label>
            <text syncTime="393.803" offset="1721792">You have to look at what purpose Congress intended that notice provision to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.334" offset="1751885">As we explain in some detail in our brief, prior to 1972, when that provision was added to the Act, the Commission, to prevent retaliation against complaining parties, developed a practice or adopted a practice of not serving a notice of the charge or a copy of the charge on the Respondent until Commission staff was available to begin investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.791" offset="1849687">Congress was concerned in 1972 that this practice resulted in some delay between the time that the charge was filed and the time the Respondent was aware that the charge was indeed pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.237" offset="1903499">So it adopted this notice provision to ensure that, in the words of the legislative report,</text>
            <text syncTime="445.565" offset="1928786">"they would have fair notice that charges were pending against them. "</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="448.315" offset="1939862">They defined "fair notice" as including the date, place, and circumstances, didn't they?</text>

            <text syncTime="454.187" offset="1963268">Yes, and this charge fully complied with that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.480" offset="1980508">The charge in this case informed the Respondent that a Commission of the EEOC had reason to believe that it discriminated against Blacks by excluding them from six specifically designated job categories, and women from seven specifically designated job categories since at least July 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.956" offset="2066399">It gave them fair notice of date, place, and circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="516.363" offset="2212058">There is a two-fold answer to that, Justice O'Connor, and I think there is a very good reason for not getting into that kind of detail at the very outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.530" offset="2248629">On the initial level, this is a pattern of practice charge, as the prior decisions of this Court recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.184" offset="2283320">The pattern of practice charge is not based on specific, individual kinds of occurrences.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.135" offset="2307144">It is based on broad, general occurrences that take place over a period of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="549.973" offset="2346432">Sure, but what the Government in these cases is doing is putting together a few simple statistics covering given years, and saying these are the total number of employees in this category, and in that community there are so many Blacks, and so many women, and these are the actual figures that the company has.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.026" offset="2450712">Why can't you include that, and why shouldn't you that in the notice of the charge?</text>

            <text syncTime="699.173" offset="2943277">The charge under Section 706 does not commence a formal enforcement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.561" offset="2968773">It merely commences administrative investigation to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the allegations of the charge are true.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.634" offset="3005135">When such reasonable cause is found, then the Commission attempts to conciliate the employment dispute and settle.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert E. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="2424.076" offset="9842843">We are not aware of any, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.137" offset="9847127">I would like to address the legislative history briefly in response to some of the arguments that have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.948" offset="9878370">First, the fact is, there is nothing in this legislative history that bears directly on the intended meaning of the words</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.553" offset="9916717">"date, place, and circumstances. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.253" offset="9923614">We take that as a point in our favor because it means there is no basis for giving those words anything other than their ordinary, everyday meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.407" offset="9956215">Secondly, what is clear from the legislative history is that Congress was not willing to give this Commission completely unbridled, roving investigative powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.994" offset="10006579">They set this up as a charged based agency, rather than an agency with a self-initiating investigative process like the FTC, and other agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.617" offset="10057047">To the extent that they gave Commission members authority to file charges, Congress took pains to see that that authority would not lead to abuse, and particularly to fishing expeditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.782" offset="10109710">That is why the 1964 Act required reasonable cause before a Commissioner could file a charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.825" offset="10137818">The concern about fishing expeditions was very explicit in the 1964 legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.621" offset="10157044">That same basic concern is reflected again in the compromise that was reached in the Conference Committee on the 1972 amendments with regard to the authority for the requirements for issuance of commissioner's charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.617" offset="10220992">The Senate bill would have cut back on the authority for commissioner's charges to allow their use only where there was an individual claiming to be aggrieved, who wished to be anonymous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.000" offset="10274595">The Senate bill added the oath requirement and added the new notice language requiring notice of date, place, and circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.947" offset="10314301">In conference, the Senate receded with respect to the provision that there needed to be an individual claiming to be aggrieved who didn't wish to come forward, but the Senate prevailed with respect to the addition of the oath and the notice requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.787" offset="10377726">Given this history, we think that it is simply not accurate to argue, as the Government does, that the '72 amendments simply eliminated any and all factual pleading requirements or any requirement to articulate the basis for a charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.312" offset="10447839">What it did was, it replaced general language of the '64 Act, which required that a charge set forth the facts on which it's based, with specific language requiring notice of date, place and circumstances, and the oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.679" offset="10509279">The point is, for the first time it spelled out three particular elements that have to be disclosed to every Respondent before a Title VII investigation can proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.502" offset="10560584">We also think that it is significant that when the Attorney General's authority to bring pattern of practice cases under Section 707 of the statute was transferred to the Commission after the '72 amendments, that authority was also made subject to the requirements that there be a valid charge under oath, and supported by notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.352" offset="10652012">Those requirements had not been present when that authority was in the hands of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.195" offset="10671343">We think the fact that they were added when the authority passed to the Commission again illustrates the unwillingness of Congress to give this Commission completely self-initiating investigative powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.206" offset="10719408">Given this background, we submit that insofar as commissioner's charges can be used to initiate investigations without an independent request from an outside party, that the formal oath and notice requirements that Congress imposed must be enforced strictly... we are not saying hypertechnically, but literally... in order to avoid conflict with the reasons why Congress set this up a charge based investigative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.988" offset="10842497">We also believe, in light of the legislative history and the context of these provisions in the statute, that the oath and notice requirements ought to be read as interrelated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.828" offset="10889831">If a charge didn't have to contain any facts or any specific indication of what it is based on, the oath would become practically meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.341" offset="10931940">We don't think Congress intended that, we think they perceived this as a meaningful requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.023" offset="10958690">Given the statutory context, it seems clear that Congress contemplated that the information that would have to be in the notice would come from the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.847" offset="10997978">Therefore, there would be a statement under oath setting forth these basic details.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.769" offset="11025668">The Commission has stressed that the statute gives it the authority to specify the form and content of charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.044" offset="11066732">But, Your Honors, that does not empower the Commission to repeal the basic statutory requirements pertaining to notice, those elements have to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.009" offset="11110618">As long as they're satisfied, sure, the Commission can require as much or as little other information in whatever form it sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.069" offset="11142801">The Commission has also argued that its regulations have consistently provided that a charge is sufficient if identifies the parties and generally describes the action or practice complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.420" offset="11208211">The fact is, the regulations relied on by the Commission for that point, it's Section 1601.12(b) of the current regulations, was not adopted until 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.246" offset="11259516">That regulation supplanted the earlier regulation, 1601.11(b), which said that a charge would be</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.239" offset="11299535">"deemed filed if it identified the parties, and generally described the action or practice complained of. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.690" offset="11325344">Both versions then provide that a charge, after being filed, can be amended to correct technical defects of omissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.858" offset="11362020">The difference is that the current regulation provides that such a charge is sufficient without being amended, whereas the earlier version prior to 1978 required only that the charge be... provided only that such a charge would be deemed filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.258" offset="11431610">Finally, with regard to the Commission's regulations, we think the Court should be particularly cautious about deferring to the Commission's standards for a valid charge insofar as they are applied to the Commission's own members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.064" offset="11498797">It may be necessary at times to apply formal requirements leniently in order to avoid injustice to individuals who may not be sophisticated in the procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.997" offset="11546549">But we see no reason why the Commission shouldn't hold its own members to a standard that at least fully satisfies the requirements of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.415" offset="11584166">We don't think that there is anything burdensome or disruptive about requiring the Commission to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.912" offset="11614154">No one is arguing here that the Commission has to disclose its entire investigative file, all the facts in its possession, that is certainly not what the Eighth Circuit required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.814" offset="11661801">We feel that that is the fallacy of those courts... the other circuits that have ruled in such a way as not to give effect to the circumstances requirement of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.168" offset="11711225">They failed to see that there is a middle ground here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.322" offset="11723868">There need not be a choice between a strict factual... detailed factual pleading requirement on the one hand, and no standard at all on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.272" offset="11767650">We think that as a matter of policy, early disclosure of the basic facts that the Commission relied on in deciding to file a charge would help to focus the issues; would lay a better groundwork for conciliation; would assist both the Commission, district offices, and the Respondent in identifying facts and data that might be relevant; would help to promote early voluntary compliance--</text>

            <text syncTime="2935.868" offset="11890007">As a matter of policy, of course, you can make some very strong arguments the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.943" offset="11906308">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have worked pretty well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.146" offset="11915189">They pretty well limited fact requirement almost out of existence in its notice pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.362" offset="11939953">It seems to me that your strongest case is based on the statute, and not on what be the best policy for Congress to choose.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_e_williams" startTime="2957.389" stopTime="3188.747">
            <label>Mr. Robert E. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="2957.389" offset="11976107">--I would agree that the principal argument is based on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.154" offset="11995124">I do think, though, Your Honor, that in a statute such as this, which places such heavy emphasis on voluntary compliance and conciliation, it is relevant to consider the impact that the Commission's stonewall approach of not disclosing anything has on the relationships between the parties at the early stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.830" offset="12093867">If the Respondent knows basically what the Commission is basing its case on, he may be able in many cases to come forward with an explanation or some exculpatory data at the very outset of the investigation that will obviate the need for this kind of extremely time-consuming, and expensive probing into every aspect of its employment practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.368" offset="12203999">So we think that that policy consideration is simply... is consistent with the literal interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.738" offset="12253527">I haven't said much to this point about the date requirement, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.247" offset="12295532">Obviously, the date of an alleged violation is somewhat more difficult to spell out in a case involving a continuing practice, or an alleged continuing practice of discrimination, than it is in an individual discharge situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.223" offset="12359480">But we still think that a fair construction of Section 706(b) requires something more specific than a mere reference to the effective date of the act, particularly where there is nothing else recited in the charge that would indicate any basis for the selection of that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.998" offset="12438579">In other words, the date and circumstances notifications may compliment one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.918" offset="12462193">The circumstances when properly set forth should indicate why the date chosen is a good faith estimate of the probable time periods of the violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.978" offset="12502422">A date that would be insufficient standing alone, might be sufficient in the context of a recitation of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.115" offset="12538993">In the worst offender situation that the Government cites, it should be relatively easy to set forth circumstances that would support a starting date going all the way back to the beginning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.406" offset="12588208">In other situations, the dates may have to be more specific in order to make it clear what the circumstances are that are being referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.932" offset="12626242">Without something more than a mere insertion of the July 2nd, 1965, date is no more... is really no more informative than a citation to the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.632" offset="12669083">In summary, let me just emphasize again that this is a straightforward case of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.738" offset="12705550">To uphold the Commission's construction is to read the statute as if the words "date, place and circumstances" were not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.110" offset="12738987">To affirm the decision below is to give those words their ordinary meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.230" offset="12759467">This does not require a choice between a hypertechnical pleading standard or no standard at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.700" offset="12785380">We think the Eighth Circuit properly perceived a middle ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.917" offset="12798232">We do believe, though, Your Honors, that since the case is here that some further clarification of what the terms "date and circumstances" mean in the context of a systemic discrimination case, based primarily on statistics, might be helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.441" offset="12868345">We suggested some fairly minimal factors in our brief at Footnote 38 that we think should be required in a case such as this.</text>
