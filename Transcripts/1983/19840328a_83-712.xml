            <text syncTime="48.434" offset="349396">In this case, the respondent was observed smoking a cigarette in a school restroom by a teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.853" offset="371025">The teacher took the student to the vice principal's office, and reported the incident to the vice principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.132" offset="396103">After the vice principal left, the student not only denied having smoked in the restroom, but also stated that it couldn't have been her because she didn't even smoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.581" offset="437899">After... following this statement, the vice principal asked for the student's purse, and opened the student's purse, finding a pack of cigarettes lying on the top.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.124" offset="472067">He picked up the cigarettes and said something to the effect of,</text>

            <text syncTime="85.013" offset="495682">looked back in the purse, and saw rolling papers for cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.652" offset="510206">He believed these were indicative of the presence of drug paraphernalia in the purse, and continued to look through the purse.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.242" offset="544583">He found marijuana and other indications that the marijuana was in the purse for purposes of distribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.717" offset="630474">New Jersey has a slightly stricter standard than the federal standard concerning consent, and it would have been absolutely necessary that the juvenile be aware of her rights prior to the search taking place in order for it to be a consent search.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.618" offset="694108">Because of this, the state has always conceded that it was not a consent search.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.099" offset="879995">T.L.O. was adjudicated a delinquent as a result of the evidence which was found, and the trial court and the New Jersey Appellate Division found that the search was totally proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.001" offset="935584">However, the New Jersey Supreme Court found that the search exceeded reasonable grounds, and therefore found that it was required to exclude the evidence which had been found in the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.949" offset="983440">Now, in reaching this decision, the New Jersey Supreme Court found that due to the amount of state action involved, that the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution would apply to this situation, and we have not protested this ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.584" offset="1037984">In addition, the New Jersey Supreme Court found that in order for a search to be reasonable under the United States Constitution in the school search context the person conducting the search must have reasonable grounds to believe that the search will uncover evidence of a crime or evidence of a violation of school discipline or school regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.649" offset="1174239">Now, the unwary might think that you were talking perhaps about an administrative proceeding where someone has been kicked out of school, wondering whether the exclusionary rule would apply in that, but here the exclusionary rule is applied by the Supreme Court of New Jersey in connection with a criminal prosecution of this person, was it not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan J. Nodes</label>
            <text syncTime="272.391" offset="1245187">Yes, it was applied in connection with a juvenile delinquency prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.545" offset="1261801">The rules in New Jersey would be the same whether it was a juvenile delinquency prosecution or a criminal prosecution.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="281.793" offset="1282803">So what we are really talking about here is the standard supporting a search, aren't we, in a school, rather than whether the exclusionary rule applies in this proceeding?</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan J. Nodes</label>
            <text syncTime="292.852" offset="1327003">Well, the primary motion that was made by the defendant was for exclusion of the evidence, and the first question that had to be reached by the New Jersey court was whether or not under any circumstances there could be exclusion of evidence illegally taken in the school situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.765" offset="1398683">If the answer to that question was no, under no circumstances would this type of evidence be excluded, then setting a standard wouldn't be absolutely necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.761" offset="1446643">That would no longer really be in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.058" offset="1451868">In the case, the New Jersey Supreme Court did do both.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.838" offset="1462944">It did set the standard and it also ruled that exclusion was warranted.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.541" offset="1629814">There have been courts which have held that the Fourth Amendment... they have gone all the way from saying the Fourth Amendment doesn't even apply to saying that the Fourth Amendment always applies and exclusion is always needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.835" offset="1667012">The reason we didn't specifically address the issue, though, of the standard, we believe both counsel have addressed that issue in their briefs, in footnotes, and we have set forth arguments, and the arguments were made before the New Jersey Supreme Court, is, the reason we didn't address it is because we think the New Jersey Supreme Court set forth a good standard and a workable standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="588.673" offset="2510350">They could watch where these students went, and make notes of where they went.</text>

            <text syncTime="764.197" offset="3212416">This Court has often noted that there is a balancing test that must be used in determining whether or not the exclusionary rule would be applied in any context.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.255" offset="3264661">For instance in United States v. Havens, the Court allowed excludable evidence to be used for purposes of impeachment.</text>

            <text syncTime="882.321" offset="3684919">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, at the recess I was trying to explain that our position is that the benefits of applying the exclusionary rule to the school search situation would be very questionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.395" offset="3737164">The idea of the rule is to punish law enforcement offers for offenses committed by themselves or constitutional transgressions committed by themselves and by other law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.264" offset="3788678">It is thought that those who are in charge of formulating policies for law enforcement will be the persons most greatly affected, since they will be the prosecutors who will lose cases if there is not compliance with the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.352" offset="3844998">Because of this, the rule is thought to have the effect of causing education of the police officers and detectives and investigators who actually conduct searches, and by this means the entire law enforcement community will be given an incentive to comply with the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.830" offset="3910931">This simply will not work with school teachers, because they are not a part of this law enforcement community, and their interests are different than law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.371" offset="3957115">They do obviously have an interest in ensuring that there is discipline in the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.057" offset="3979894">This interest, however, is secondary to the primary interest, which is to educate the students.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.539" offset="4005808">The primary function of a police officer is law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.554" offset="4017824">A policeman becomes a policeman because of an interest in enforcing laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.365" offset="4037050">A school teacher becomes a school teacher because of an interest in education.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.971" offset="4059515">Because the interest in law enforcement is so secondary, the benefits of the exclusionary rule in the school search situation would be even less than they are in the general criminal law situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.465" offset="4117507">This Court has noted often that there is clearly very little empirical data of the effectiveness of the exclusionary rule, and there is some question as to how well it works for law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.726" offset="4166513">When we remove the person who is doing the search one step further from the law enforcement and one step further from the trial at which exclusion will occur, there is much more question about the effectiveness of the exclusionary rule, and much more question as to whether or not it will actually be a deterrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.046" offset="4239760">As far as the real detriments of the exclusionary rule, the major detriment has, of course, been noted on many occasions by this Court, that the guilty may go free because of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.213" offset="4292423">This is tolerated because the rule is felt to foster respect for criminal laws and respect for our system of criminal justice in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.021" offset="4339652">But as Justice Powell writing for the Court in Stone v. Powell noted, the indiscriminate use of the exclusionary rule could actually have the opposite of the intended effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.204" offset="4384479">It could actually nurture disrespect for our criminal laws, and could actually nurture disrespect for our system of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.124" offset="4416139">This is obviously a detriment any time the exclusionary rule is possibly extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.978" offset="4439545">This detriment may be even greater in the school search situation because disrespect of our criminal laws and disrespect of the system of justice is not a lesson which we should teach our students.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.536" offset="4489804">Therefore, before the exclusionary rule is applied to school searches by school teachers and officials, it should be very clear that the benefits of the rule outweigh the detriments, and that there are no other means of exacting compliance with the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.765" offset="4558663">We believe that the detriments have been set forth very clearly and that the benefits are very limited, and the only way that we could really get a beneficial effect from the exclusionary rule in a school search situation so that it would foster compliance with the Constitution is to have teachers act as policemen, to have teachers follow the same rules as policemen, for teachers to actually investigate as policemen.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.522" offset="5097726">We suggest that this would be at least as true in a school search situation, and we suggest that the more egregious a search, the more chances the deterrence would occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.393" offset="5141194">If a student goes home and complains to his parent that he has just been the subject of an unreasonable search, there is a high likelihood that the parent will complain to the principal or to the board of education, and there is a great likelihood that the principal or the board of education will take action on the basis of that complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.339" offset="5212978">In New Jersey, as in many other states, there are systems for bringing community complaints to boards of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.696" offset="5242444">If a complaint were filed against a school teacher or an administrator, the local board of education would consider the complaint, and if there was merit, they would report the complaint to the state board of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.691" offset="5290405">That board has the power to remove tenure from the school teacher, cause the school teacher to be fired, or to revoke the license of a school teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.311" offset="5336903">We believe that this is the type of a real deterrent against unlawful actions which will actually work and which will actually have an effect on school teachers and on school administrators, and I think that the final analysis is, we will find that if unreasonable searches continue, the community pressure will stop them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.068" offset="5419868">So there is an automatic safeguard in place to unreasonable searches in the school situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.285" offset="5444736">In addition, there is the possibility criminal action being brought against a student or teacher who conducts an unreasonable search, and this would be particularly true in the situation of a possible strip search or a search of that type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.402" offset="5521223">There are obvious criminal possibilities, and the teacher who is involved in a search like that or the official would have to consider those possibilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1357.350" offset="5585066">--Admittedly, there would be very little chance of criminal action in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.988" offset="5607532">We believe that this is a less intrusive search than many others that have been referred to in the defendant's brief, and I believe that this is a much closer call than in many of the other situations which defendant has referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.638" offset="5658209">And because it is such a close call, there would be less of a chance of deterrence obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.854" offset="5687048">The Supreme Court of New Jersey, while finding that the search in this case was not within Constitutional bounds, did not say that the general actions of the school vice principal were totally unreasonable, but just that they were unreasonable under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.739" offset="5746608">In that situation, it is obviously much harder to deter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.738" offset="5762594">I think, though, that this case, at least in New Jersey, has taught educators what the framework is within which they must work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.078" offset="5795927">I think because of this case they have learned something, regardless of whether there is actually exclusion or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.154" offset="5816198">There is also the chance of bringing a tort action or a 1983 action either in the state court or in the federal court against a teacher or a school official who unreasonably searches a student.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.725" offset="5878474">These types of things have been known not to be effective deterrents in the law enforcement situation where law enforcement officers are dealing primarily with criminals and people who on the most part are found to have contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.203" offset="5944407">However, in the situation of an unreasonable search of a school student, I suggest that there would be a much greater chance that a 1983 action could be successful because the school student is simply going to provide a much more sympathetic figure to put before a jury when requesting damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.460" offset="6025491">And even if damages aren't actually returned in each case, the school teachers and school officials' awareness of the possibility of damages can have a detrimental... a deterrent effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.502" offset="6069585">Defendant or respondent has pointed out that in Wood v. Strickland this Court limited the liability of school officials from 1983 actions, and said that they would not be liable for good faith violations, and the respondent points out that this would limit the detrimental... the deterrent effect which these type of actions can have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.695" offset="6174389">We believe that these cases teach another lesson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.225" offset="6188495">The Court has determined that because of the realities of a school situation, because of the necessities for making sure that there is discipline in schools, that schools shall be treated somewhat differently, that school teachers and administrators shall not be treated precisely as law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.249" offset="6268639">Now, having limited the first party deterrent effect that a 1983 action may have, we believe that it would not be appropriate to try to enforce compliance with the Constitution by means of a third party deterrent, and in the school search situation, that is what the exclusionary rule would really amount to, because the school teacher is clearly one step removed from the police officer to whom they turn over the evidence, and that person is one step removed from the prosecutor from who the evidence will be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.439" offset="6393399">We believe that in an ideal situation a means would clearly be developed to ensure that the Constitution was complied with while enforcement of criminal laws went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.028" offset="6435718">This Court has noted that in the criminal situation this wasn't possible and therefore a choice must be made and a compromise must be reached, and the exclusionary rule was set up as a choice, as compromise between ensuring full criminal prosecution and ensuring the constitutional rights are highly regarded by law enforcement officers and other state officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.205" offset="6532475">We now are facing a situation where we don't have to make a choice, where we don't have to accept a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.453" offset="6557448">We have a situation where the benefits of the rule would be slight, but we do have other deterrents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.154" offset="6584198">We can teach the school children that they must comply with the criminal laws while also teaching them that there are deterrents in place which will ensure that their constitutional rights won't be violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.399" offset="6633203">We suggest this is the rule we should be teaching these students.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.227" offset="6644488">I would reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1641.233" offset="6720557">This case arises in the factual setting of the public school system, but I would urge the Court not to let the context obscure the fact that the issues presented here are not ones of educational policy, but are rather ones of criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.321" offset="6780952">The question is not whether or under what circumstances schools may regulate the conduct of their students.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.195" offset="6804358">It is not whether this school may use certain types of evidence in its own internal disciplinary proceedings to form the basis for imposing school sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.347" offset="6841034">Rather, the question is whether a court of law may permit an individual to be convicted of a crime based upon evidence illegally seized from him by a government official.</text>

            <text syncTime="1702.787" offset="6966735">--Your Honor, the Fourth Amendment has never been applied to actions by purely private citizens, and certainly a parent would be acting in a purely private capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.986" offset="7007590">However, courts have distinguished between the teacher acting as a state official and the parent acting in a parental role.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.357" offset="7044998">At one time, courts held that the teacher acted in loco parentis, that is to say, instead of the parent, and that doctrine may well have accorded with facts of the educational system as it stood 200 years ago, when the parent would hire a tutor or select a private school that would carry out the parents' own educational philosophy and disciplinary standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.348" offset="7141024">But in today's modern compulsory system of education, the teacher serves a very different role.</text>

            <text syncTime="1752.846" offset="7167042">The mother is called to the school by the principal, and the whole episode occurs just as it did here, except that the mother orders the girl to open her purse.</text>

            <text syncTime="1767.605" offset="7226079">I would submit, yes, that that might very well be perfectly proper under the Constitution, and if the parent gave the evidence to the police, that may well also be proper.</text>

            <text syncTime="3097.836" offset="12547012">I think that the use of searches is at best a bandaid approach to a problem which I don't think any educator would view as a remedial measure of first choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3115.687" offset="12618379">The question is whether we have to throw out students' Fourth Amendment rights in order to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.903" offset="12643248">The drug problem in society at large is certainly a serious one, but we have not permitted the police to throw away the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.634" offset="12674176">We have not completely neutralized the Fourth Amendment protections through the exclusionary rule in order to attack the problem of drugs or weapons in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.364" offset="12713047">The standard which was imposed below was a compromise that recognized that when you are dealing with children you perhaps have more responsibility than when you are dealing with adults, and that may justify the lesser standard that was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.062" offset="12767904">Also, the court specifically stated that there were many factors which could be taken into consideration, such as the age of the child, the child's prior involvement in criminal activity or disruptive behavior, the nature of the school's own problems, all of which would be considered by a court in determining whether a reasonable grounds existed for the search to be conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.490" offset="12861631">It is also important to recognize particularly in the school context that the exclusionary rule does deter conduct on the part of teachers, that while teachers are not, like the police, directly involved in the criminal justice process, they do have some interest, substantial interest in seeing criminal prosecutions against their students brought to a successful conclusion, because they are responsible for maintaining order in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.478" offset="12985556">And the fact of a juvenile or criminal conviction would certainly assist the school in dealing with a dangerous or disruptive student.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.974" offset="13019515">It might remove the student entirely from the school by means of a custodial disposition, or through some lesser sanction might persuade the student to conform his conduct to school norms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.750" offset="13062670">So, I think that teachers would be deterred, and do have some incentive to follow Fourth Amendment guidelines that would ensure that no evidence would be suppressed in a later court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.215" offset="13108436">I think it is also important to recognize in the school context that the exclusionary rule serves an educative as well as a deterrent function.</text>
