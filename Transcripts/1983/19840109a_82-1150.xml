            <text syncTime="21.073" offset="226881">It was here in Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.666" offset="233255">It was here in Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.627" offset="241091">And it now commences its thirty-third year of litigation against employees whom it represents, disputing the use of compulsory fees obtained from those employees.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="42.839" offset="313921">Do the other unions just defer to you, or--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_e_merrill" startTime="45.481" stopTime="134.279">
            <label>Mr. Michael E. Merrill</label>
            <text syncTime="45.481" offset="324579">--It is sometimes not pleasant to be special, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.845" offset="342029">The Ellis and Failes cases present the record which has eluded this Court in the past, and permit the Court to issue rulings upon these vital issues: first, the extent of the union's entitlement to the use of compulsory dues and fees obtained from dissenting employees; second, the standard of proof the union must meet to justify those charges; third, the remedy for dissenting employees whose fees have been or will be misspent.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.058" offset="490822">In this case, we have a hierarchy of interests, that of the petitioners, the fundamental individual First Amendment rights of free speech and association.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.737" offset="545575">Those rights have existed since the Republic was founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.619" offset="561039">On the union hand, we have a recently enacted statutory privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.075" offset="590923">The union's interest is a monetary interest only.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.497" offset="608582">When those two rights are juxtaposed, it is clear that the First Amendment interests of the petitioners must override, absent a compelling governmental necessity for giving sway to the union's property interest.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="134.279" offset="679740">--Mr. Merrill, are you saying that any time the individual says something that is done to him violates the First Amendment and the person who is violating the First Amendment or alleged to is interested primarily in the financial outcome, that that automatically decides the case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_e_merrill" startTime="152.541" stopTime="487.234">
            <label>Mr. Michael E. Merrill</label>
            <text syncTime="152.541" offset="752778">Justice Rehnquist, I do not make that assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.753" offset="765630">We do assert, consistent with Abood, that when a union obtaining money under the force of federal statute uses that money in a way that would otherwise impinge upon associational or expression rights, that that must be... must uphold... that use must meet constitutional standards of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.120" offset="859044">Interpreting the statutory scheme here, the Railway Labor Act, must be done from the standpoint of viewing it with strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.800" offset="913797">We must ascertain what Congress sought to accomplish in passing this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.546" offset="940755">We have dependable guidance in making that journey in the decisions of this Court, in the Street case, in the Allen case, and in Abood.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.901" offset="990179">In the latter case, this Court has ruled that the First Amendment sweeps broadly in a context of compulsory dues litigation, that it extends to encompass social interests, economic and philosophical interests, literary interests, and, of course, political and ideological interests of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.540" offset="1096758">As noted, there must be a compelling justification to intrude upon those rights and those interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.827" offset="1137927">In addition, using established First Amendment principles, the means selected by Congress to accomplish the governmental purpose must impose the minimum burden on plaintiff's constitutional freedoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.897" offset="1206159">Now, the specific Congressional purpose authorized and not commanded in the 1951 amendments to this statute was that of obtaining payment for specific services.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.527" offset="1264673">It was to pay a union representing employees in a specific collective bargaining context for the acts of the union as a negotiating agent, and for its services in administering that contract, and in handling and prosecuting grievances of employees arising under that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.384" offset="1368118">Again, we have many decisions of this Court which make it plain that the procedure used to protect the union's interests in this case, that of obtaining money from the plaintiffs, must be drawn in such a fashion so as not to sacrifice the overriding constitutional interests of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.890" offset="1466130">As the Court analyzes this case, it is of extreme importance to remember that the union wears two hats.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.908" offset="1506254">The first of those hats, which existed long prior to the occurrence of the statute giving rise to this controversy, is that of a voluntary fraternal organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.444" offset="1556409">As a fraternal organization, BRAC can do anything it chooses.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.318" offset="1579919">It can engage in ideological activity, religious activity, sociological, economic, political activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.165" offset="1615237">There is no limit other than law upon what it chooses to do, and we note that this Court recognized in Street that unions are inherently ideological and political organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.495" offset="1672602">Surely no one would argue that a private citizen can be compelled, consistent with the exercise of his First Amendment rights, that one must support the activities of a fraternal organization in that light.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.805" offset="1737803">So, we turn then to the second hat warn by BRAC, and it is wearing that hat when it sought the Congressional purpose, the Congressional permission to obtain money from dissenting employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.324" offset="1803945">It is the collective bargaining representative hat, and when the unions went to Congress in 1950 seeking permission to compel the payment of dues, they stressed that they were required to perform duties with respect to dissenting employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.031" offset="1894747">They already enjoyed excellent success in generating voluntary membership support.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.205" offset="1919406">As the Court noted from the legislative history, voluntary membership levels of 75 to 80 percent were commonplace by the late 1940's.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.701" offset="1957441">Nevertheless, the unions stated to Congress that they were required to provide the duty of fair representation to those who chose not to support the unions, who disagreed with their policies, who wished not to be a part of those organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.275" offset="2035704">On the limited basis that those functions had by law to be performed, Congress was persuaded to authorize compulsory payment for those services only.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="487.234" stopTime="493.529">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="487.234" offset="2091501">Weren't there closed shops in the railway industry before the early fifties?</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_e_merrill" startTime="493.529" stopTime="505.898">
            <label>Mr. Michael E. Merrill</label>
            <text syncTime="493.529" offset="2116683">There were not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.628" offset="2121072">In the 1934 Act, no form of union security was permitted, so it was strictly voluntary unionism from 1934 until 1951.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="505.898" stopTime="509.828">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="505.898" offset="2166211">So this Act didn't follow the same path as the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_e_merrill" startTime="509.828" stopTime="690.299">
            <label>Mr. Michael E. Merrill</label>
            <text syncTime="509.828" offset="2181885">That is correct, and I might point out that the railway unions had never found compulsory unionism to be essential to their well-being because at the time of the 1934 statute, only one such organization had compulsory membership provisions in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.981" offset="2254505">So, we see that the collective bargaining representative hat is that which Congress addressed in the statute, and it is a confusion of those two roles that BRAC urges upon this Court and successfully urged upon the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.734" offset="2345516">I point out that not only did BRAC provide a limited statutory role with respect to petitioners, it did so grudgingly, treating them as objectives of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.556" offset="2416882">Petitioners were not entitled under this union's constitution and practices to attend meetings, to vote for officers, to serve as grievance representatives, to vote for grievance representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.018" offset="2478636">Even with respect to the fraternal activities, which this union seeks to compel payment for, petitioners were excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.064" offset="2518864">Agency fee payers did not receive union publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.087" offset="2538926">They were expressly made inelligible for death benefit fund participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.353" offset="2567975">Only at a later time, when it became apparent that the union might not be able to continue collecting for those functions, after plaintiff's motion for summary judgment had been filed, did this union generously say, oh, well, we meant to make these benefits available to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.008" offset="2654597">So, we see that petitioners were treated in a very limited sense by BRAC, just as they were viewed by Congress in a very limited sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.335" offset="2699945">The Ninth Circuit majority decision has interpreted this statute from the perspective of a financially acquisitive union, not from the perspective of Congress, and not from the perspective that this Court described in the Street case.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.890" offset="2794195">If one is to read the statute as did the Ninth Circuit majority, Congress' objective was to maximize union power in general, and to legitimize charges for any union fraternal activity bearing any conceivable, arguable relationship to the function of the union in the realm of collective bargaining.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="690.299" stopTime="695.231">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="690.299" offset="2903805">That is really not the test they stated, is it, any conceivable, arguable relationship?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_e_merrill" startTime="695.231" stopTime="708.741">
            <label>Mr. Michael E. Merrill</label>
            <text syncTime="695.231" offset="2923553">Their test is stated that it is anything that is done by the... the work of the union that is germane to the realm of collective bargaining, a test we have not seen in any other case before or since.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="708.741" stopTime="711.222">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="708.741" offset="2977575">But it is quite a different test than the one you just stated.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_e_merrill" startTime="711.222" stopTime="770.551">
            <label>Mr. Michael E. Merrill</label>
            <text syncTime="711.222" offset="2987501">In practice, Your Honor, I believe that it is exactly the test that I stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.337" offset="3011952">If one looks closely at the range of activities supported through the compulsory fee by BRAC, one finds no limits other than partisan political activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.365" offset="3060122">That is the only sphere safeguarded by the trial court judgment as modified by the Ninth Circuit majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.278" offset="3087707">If one is to take this expansive statutory interpretation, it assures us that we will run roughshod over constitutionally guaranteed rights, and destroy the painstaking efforts of this Court to save the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.863" offset="3178091">Such a construction also runs counter to Congress' intent, because Congress did not favor unions over employers.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence E. Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="1532.974" offset="6274541">May it please the Court, I think it would be helpful in light of the discussion to this point to state our understanding of the holdings of this Court on this issue to this point and our understanding of the issues that those holdings leave open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.064" offset="6406825">The issue presented here has been before the Court in one form or another four times, in the Hansen case, the Street case, the Allen case, and the Abood case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.236" offset="6471504">Those cases in our judgment establish one point in favor of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.664" offset="6525317">That point is the following, and I would like to quote the Court's opinion in Abood at 431 U.S. 234.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.855" offset="6589996">"The appellants argue that they fall within the protection of certain cases because they have been prohibited not from actively associating, but rather from refusing to associate. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.603" offset="6645062">"They specifically argued that they may constitutionally prevent the union spending of a part of their required service fees to contribute to political candidates and to express political views unrelated to its duties as exclusive bargaining representative. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.789" offset="6737744">"We have concluded that this argument is a meritorious one. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.422" offset="6760314">Thus, what has been established to the objecting employee's or petitioner's benefit to this point by the cases decided by this Court is that on statutory grounds under the Railway Labor Act and on constitutional grounds with regard to public employees, unions may not spend exacted fees for contributions to political candidates and to express political views unrelated to the union's duties as exclusive bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.423" offset="6936275">Nothing more has been established in the cases to the petitioners' benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.858" offset="6978071">Of equal importance, it seems to us, the Hansen Court upheld the constitutionality of the union shop as such, and that holding was reaffirmed again in Street and in Allen and in Abood, and while Mr. Merrill says that the Ninth Circuit created a new standard for determining the scope of the union shop and of required payments to unions, again, I beg your indulgence to quote two short passages from Hansen which are set out at Pages 23 and 24 of our brief, the red brief, and appear in the original 351 U.S. at 234, I believe, and 238 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.321" offset="7235847">The Court in the Hansen opinion said the following:</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.734" offset="7253506">"The financial support required relates therefore to the work of the union in the realm of collective bargaining. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.809" offset="7289869">That is exactly the phrase decried by Mr. Merrill as no standard at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.784" offset="7321738">And the Court continued,</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.547" offset="7328843">"No more precise allocation of union overhead to individual members seems to us to be necessary. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.511" offset="7364683">Then, on 238, the Court stated its holding--</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.097" offset="7387044">"We hold that the requirement for financial support of the collective bargaining agency by all who receive the benefits of its work is within the power of Congress under the commerce clause and does not violate either the First or the Fith Amendment. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.150" offset="7483175">Now, to this point, the Court has not stated what is encompassed in the area germane to collective bargaining or germane to the work of the union in the realm of collective bargaining, nor has it defined in particular terms what it is that is political activity or political or ideological activity unrelated to collective bargaining, and the phrase "unrelated to collective bargaining", a conditioning of the protection accorded to petitioners herefore, would hardly have been necessary if every political and every ideological act of the union was unconstitutional if support under the union shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.226" offset="7699469">And this case, we believe, is a case which on certain basic categories of union expenses, particularly the expenses of national unions, does present the occasion for the Court to answer that question, and to draw or at least to begin the job of drawing that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.267" offset="7827678">In doing so, we would begin by stressing the following point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.516" offset="7876683">Both of the courts below, the District Court and the Court of Appeals, concluded that the union for the years in question here, 1975 and forward, has met its obligations stated in Street and Allen and Abood to identify and to free objecting employees from any obligation to support the union's political and ideological activity unrelated to collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.832" offset="8041986">The District Court's findings to this effect are set out in our brief at Pages 9 to 10, again, the red brief, in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.700" offset="8097366">We would also call the Court's attention to the joint appendix, Pages 345 to 358 and 421 to 459, which are the trial... which are portions of the trial proceedings and the union's internal documents establishing the system of identification and of deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.720" offset="8213454">It provides that all direct and indirect partisan political expenditures are not charged to an objecting employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.707" offset="8261415">All direct and indirect legislative lobbying expenditures are not charged to an objecting employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.694" offset="8297359">All dues to affiliated organizations, such as the AFL-CIO and the Canadian Labor Congress, are not charged to objecting employees, and all contributions to other organizations, such as the Red Cross, the NAACP, and other organizations in the examples given in the union's internal documents are not charged to objecting employees, and the union has gone to the extent of requiring a detailed contemporaneous accounting of time and effort that goes into these activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.255" offset="8483664">We believe that the District Court was not only right in this, but that the union has gone well beyond the requirements of law in this area of defining political and ideological activity.</text>
