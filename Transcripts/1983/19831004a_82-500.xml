            <text syncTime="63.475" offset="396784">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="66.957" offset="410785">This case presents two important issues of interpretation under the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.001" offset="446939">A preliminary question regarding the Court's jurisdiction to hear the case has also been raised, and I will address that point at the outset of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.701" offset="485705">On the merits the two issues are first whether the states are free to enact statutory exceptions to the Federal Arbitration Act thereby striking down arbitration agreements that would otherwise be valid, irrevocable and enforceable under the specific terms of Section 2 of the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.579" offset="597195">The second issue is whether the states are free to engraft their judicial class action procedures onto private arbitrations involving interstate commerce being conducted pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.979" offset="666890">The issues in this case arose in the following way: The Plaintiff Appellees are former franchisees of 7-Eleven convenient stores in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.878" offset="726449">They alleged that their franchisor, the Southland Corporation, violated the terms of the franchise agreement with respect to certain of its bookkeeping procedures and also that it did not fully disclose to them at the time they became franchisees the types of procedures that it would use in preparing financial statements for their stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.743" offset="833865">They claimed that Southland's actions and inactions constituted a breach of contract, a breach of a fiduciary duty, a common law fraud, and a violation of the state's franchise investment law which requires franchisors to make certain types of disclosures to their respective franchisees.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.921" offset="922576">These cases were filed in court notwithstanding a broad forum arbitration clause in the franchise agreement, and the Plaintiffs have resisted arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.542" offset="977120">This effort has been successful so far because they have convinced the California Supreme Court that it is contrary to the public policy of the state's franchise invesment law to require franchisees to arbitrate claims that they base on that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.424" offset="1048591">They have also convinced the California Supreme Court with respect to the clearly arbitrable claims, the common law, breach of contract and fraud claims, to remand the cases not to an arbitrator but back to the trial court so that the court can conduct class certification proceedings and thereafter to supervise any arbitration which is held to be appropriate for class-wide adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.099" offset="1171367">We have brought this case here under Section 1257 of the judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.065" offset="1203236">The Plaintiffs have argued that jurisdiction is lacking because the decision below allegedly does not constitute a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.624" offset="1241375">They base this argument on the fact that the California Supreme Court contemplates that extensive judicial proceedings are yet to come in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.056" offset="1291112">I submit if it may please the Court that that is precisely the point that the parties agreed to arbitrate this case in a nonjudicial forum and that is where we ought to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.441" offset="1356731">The evil, if I may use that term, of the California Supreme Court's decision is precisely that it is compelling extensive judicial proceedings to occur in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.323" offset="1420261">Under the practical tests that this Court uses to determine finality we think that the decision is clearly final because it decides important issues under a federal statute in a definitive way.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.677" offset="1489642">These issues are collateral to the merits of the case and in addition the decision is final in the sense that if this Court reverses the decision of the Court below the judicial proceedings clearly will be at an end.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.481" offset="1560800">The class arbitration issue was certainly not clearly raised below was it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark J. Spooner</label>
            <text syncTime="360.339" offset="1584310">Your Honor, it was raised below.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.962" offset="1598730">We stated the issue in the California Supreme Court as follows: Whether a court may enter an order compelling the private commercial arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the rules of the American Arbitration Association to proceed as a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.094" offset="1683262">The Plaintiffs have argued strenuously in their brief in this Court that we did not litigate this issue as a federal question, but I submit that that claim is a red herring.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.996" offset="1734880">What happened was that the parties all stipulated in the court below that this case involved interstate commerce and thus the federal Act applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.396" offset="1784513">Our argument was that arbitration and class actions were fundamentally incompatible with one another and, therefore, if you superimposed class action procedures which would necessarily involve extensive judicial involvement onto a private arbitration you would in essence be destroying the arbitration proceeding as the nonjudicial procedure it was itended to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.135" offset="1899451">We also--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Mark J. Spooner</label>
            <text syncTime="462.626" offset="1993388">--Yes, in the sense that the state courts are required to enforce the Federal Arbitration Act just as the federal courts are.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.792" offset="2038109">This Court in the Moses Cohen Hopsital case last term specifically held that.</text>

            <text syncTime="482.336" offset="2072278">I thought Moses Cohen came from a federal court.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="489.366" offset="2100385">I thought a holding was something that was necessary to the disposition of a case.</text>

          <turn speaker="mark_j_spooner" startTime="493.628" stopTime="527.162">

            <text syncTime="493.628" offset="2117417">--Well, Your Honor, I stand corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.690" offset="2133718">The Court did state several points in its opinion and I may... It may not have been the holding of the decision, but the Court emphasized that the Federal Arbitration Act establishes a substantive right in favor of arbitration and that this substantive right prevails over any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="527.162" stopTime="528.895">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="527.162" offset="2251582">But it was dicta, was it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_j_spooner" startTime="528.895" stopTime="574.799">
            <label>Mr. Mark J. Spooner</label>
            <text syncTime="528.895" offset="2258478">I think that is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.863" offset="2270390">Turning to the first of the issues presented here on the merits, the question is whether the states are free to enact statutory exceptance to the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.855" offset="2350325">We believe that the court was clearly incorrect in so holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.320" offset="2380209">The Federal Arbitration Act was specifically designed to overrule state policies and legislation which would do precisely what the California statute does in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.113" offset="2435380">Section 2--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="574.799" stopTime="601.303">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="574.799" offset="2442171">Well is the evidence of the congressional intent not somewhat indicative that it only intended it to imply in federal courts?</text>
            <text syncTime="585.529" offset="2485012">The problem came I suppose with Erie v. Thompkins and all of that, but the evidence of what Congress intended is pretty clearly against you.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_j_spooner" startTime="601.303" stopTime="1014.746">
            <label>Mr. Mark J. Spooner</label>
            <text syncTime="601.303" offset="2548124">--Your Honor, I do not agree that the evidence is clearly against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.645" offset="2569545">The procedural protections in many of the sections of the Federal Arbitration Act speak to what the United States courts should do if proceedings relating to arbitration are brought in the United States courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.560" offset="2637149">However, Section 2 of the federal statute specifically says without limiting the protection of the statute to any particular courts that arbitration agreements involving maritime trade or interstate commerce shall be valid, irrevocable and enforceable save on such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.377" offset="2752402">What Congress did in this section was to broadly declare that these contracts shall be upheld and they shall be enforced except on grounds that apply to any contract such as waiver or duress in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.056" offset="2835158">But if a contract satisfies those general doctrines of contract formation, Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act says that that contract must be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.957" offset="2890746">I think also that if Section 2 were read otherwise very unfortunate results would occur because the enforceability of an arbitration agreement in interstate commerce would depend on the forum in which enforcement was sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.731" offset="2969845">That would lead to forum shopping and would destroy the predictability in interstate commercial dealings that is so important.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.101" offset="3019373">Section 2 does not say that arbitration agreements in interstate commerce shall be enforceable unless the states provide otherwise, and we do not think it can logically be read in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.733" offset="3113832">If it were, states could undermine the entire policy of the Act merely by creating a cause of action in which they say that you cannot arbitrate this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.335" offset="3164300">I think this case presents a pretty good example of precisely that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.036" offset="3195020">The Plaintiffs' claim in this case is essentially a breach of contract and a fraud claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.159" offset="3219576">They say that their franchisor mislead them and failed to disclose material facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.297" offset="3248101">The common law fraud claim is clearly arbitrable and the statutory claim is indistinguishable in terms of its elements, in terms of its basic nature from the common law claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.446" offset="3312676">Yet what the Appellees are arguing in this case is that if the legislature of California chooses to say that you cannot arbitrate this kind of claim then what would otherwise be valid and enforceable under the federal statute ceases to become so.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.641" offset="3393447">The Plaintiffs' argument on this issue really boils down to stating that Congress has occasionally adopted exceptions to the Federal Arbitration Act when it has passed various types of federal legislation so why should the states not be free to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.912" offset="3482576">Well the answer to that is simply that the Supremacy Clause applies to the states and it does not control what Congress can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.159" offset="3519566">What Congress gives it can take away, but the states cannot take away what Congress has made valid and enforceable in a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.765" offset="3553943">There are obvious policy differences as well between exceptions to a protective federal statute like this where the exceptions are created by Congress and the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.291" offset="3612039">Congress when it is considering adopting an exception can carefully balance the different considerations and can keep the scope of the exceptions within very narrow limits, but when each of 50 individual states are permitted to adopt exceptions the scope of those exceptions will become virtually uncontrolled.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.937" offset="3710678">The other important difference from a policy point of view is that any exceptions adopted by Congress will apply uniformly throughout the United States and parties that enter into arbitration agreements will be able to predict whether those agreements are going to be enforced or not with respect to particular kinds of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.864" offset="3806390">But if each state can decide for itself when these agreements are going to be enforced and when they are not that predictability would be lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.907" offset="3850589">The Plaintiffs' position in this case or rather I should say the California legislation in this case as interpreted by the State Supreme Court reflects we think a basic mistrust for arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.212" offset="3931778">The underlying notion of their argument seems to be that arbitration is somehow going to be a vehicle that is going to allow the party with the superior resources to defeat small claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.080" offset="3987262">I think that that basic premise is one that has to be challenged, that arbitration is beneficial for everybody but particularly beneficial when small claims and people with limited resources are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.026" offset="4063017">The party with the superior resources can often litigate cases to death, can take full advantage of discovery rules, string out the case forever and frustrate small claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.019" offset="4119024">But if a party is free to bring a case in arbitration he can get it tried promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.611" offset="4149326">He can devote the resources to it that it deserves, and he can prevent the liberal discovery rules and the backlog of the courts from frustrating getting a resolution of his claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.746" offset="4201884">Mr. Spooner, what if the California legislature had felt very strongly contrary perhaps perversely contrary to the way you are now speaking and felt that arbitration was just simply a trap for the unwary and, therefore, it said that no contractual undertaking in this state providing for arbitration shall be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.736" offset="4305851">Do you think that is just all down the well, so to speak, after the Federal Arbitration Act?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1046.500" offset="4328944">What if Congress adopted a statute called the Federal Confession of Judgment Statute providing that there should be confessions of judgment permissible in all proceedings in federal or state courts and lots of states I guess have a policy against confessions of judgment because they regard them as pretty one-sided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.630" offset="4429463">No problem about enforcing that if Congress said so?</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.143" offset="4443465">Well, it is a question of whether that legislation would be within the proper scope of Congress' power to legislate in interstate commerce, and if it were a constitutional exercise of its power certainly it would overrule any contrary legislation enacted by the individual states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.261" offset="4523922">With regard to the Federal Arbitration Act, I think that this Court held in the Prima Paint case that the statute clearly is a proper exercise of Congress' power to legislate in the area of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.127" offset="4607409">If I may turn to the second issue which is presented here for review, the class action issue, what the Court held was that this case should go back to the trial court even with respect to claims that are clearly subject to arbitration, the nonfranchise investment law claims, so that the court could conduct class certification proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1176.634" offset="4849512">First of all, a specific California statute, Section 1294 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, specifically states that if a petition to compel arbitration is denied the party has to take its appeal immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.923" offset="4926625">So Southland took its appeal at the juncture in this case when it was compelled to do so as a matter of California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.482" offset="4964869">Secondly, the Plaintiffs' argument is that a class has not been certified yet in this case and that Southland may be able to convince the trial court not to certify a class and, therefore, we do not have a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.820" offset="5034250">What this misses, I think, is that the issue here is more fundamental than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.692" offset="5057656">Even if at the end of judicial class certification proceedings Southland were able to defeat the class, it would have been required to go through many months of very highly judicial proceedings which would be enmeshed with the underlying merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.964" offset="5134769">This Court has stressed that class certification issues requried a very careful inquiry into the nature of the claims that are involved in the case and the type of evidence that would be presented at a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.521" offset="5197045">Therefore, what inevitably happens in these cases is that the parties take detailed discovery to explore that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.829" offset="5242289">They brief the issue extensively to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.124" offset="5251380">The Court often holds an evidentiary hearing on the issue, and this Court has held that evidentiary hearings may be required in some instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.355" offset="5292340">Then a decision is rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.291" offset="5300072">Now even if at the end of this many months of proceedings Southland were able to defeat the class, we think that the decision of the California court here opens up a judicial procedure which is in direct contradiction of the policy of the Federal Arbitration Act which as this Court said in the Moses Cohen case is to move people out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="1389.033" offset="5699014">They do not have the power to do that because the federal statute creates a right of the parties to have their arbitration agreement enforced and it is not the province of the court to decide in a particular case that some other procedure would be more efficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="1430.453" offset="5864735">There is no issue here in that regard because the contract does not say anything about class action proceedings, and I think that the California Supreme Court rendered a decision which assumes that the contract does not provide for such arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.445" offset="5952715">The thrust of its decision is that regardless of whether the parties agree to it or not this can be imposed on the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.722" offset="5989809">Speaking very briefly about the merits of this class action issue, our position is simply that the two procedures, class actions and arbitrations, are fundamentally incompatible with one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.808" offset="6062116">The whole idea of arbitration is to establish a procedure which is simple and quick and inexpensive and informal and most of all nonjudicial whereas class actions by their very nature as well as by due process considerations are necessarily very formalized in their procedures, very time consuming, very expensive and most of all highly regulated by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.404" offset="6196594">If a court did not actively supervise every stage of this proceeding and guarantee that the named representative is adequately represented the class, if the court did not ensure that the evidence being presented in trial were truly common to all class members the results of that arbitration would not be binding on absent class members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.817" offset="6290217">So if a court tries to create a hybrid of the two procedures you would have to have a court looking over the arbitrator's shoulders every step of the way and you would be creating endless opportunities for one part or the other to go running back to court asking a judge to second-guess what the arbitrator has done.</text>

            <text syncTime="1631.966" offset="6670769">They did not define what that measure of supervision and control would be, but our position is that it would necessarily be quite extensive and regardless of whether it was extensive or not it would be inconsistent with the idea that arbitration is supposed to be a procedure apart from the court systems taking place outside of that forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1659.767" offset="6781946">It really again relates a little bit to the finality, but do we know that on remand if the issues are a little more clearly defined than they seem to be now, say, for example, that you get an arbitration of whether there was adequate disclosure and presumably you have got some form documents you give every franchisee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.964" offset="6846834">Do we know it will be contrary to your client's interest to have a single arbitration resolving that issue for everybody who says you did not make an adequate disclosure?</text>

            <text syncTime="1819.139" offset="7419438">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.934" offset="7434694">I would like to begin discussing the problem that Mr. Schooner discussed first, namely, the question raised by the claim that the Federal Arbitration Act preempts any claims litigated under the franchise, that is, preempts the anti-waiver clause in the California franchise investment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.830" offset="7546289">But before addressing the question of preemption there is a preliminary issue that needs to be resolved and needs to be addressed by this Court, and that is whether the arbitration clause in question in fact and in law is broad enough to include the claims under the California franchise investment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.490" offset="7660914">The preliminary question was decided in the trial court in this case against arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.237" offset="7699889">He concluded that the clause in question was not intended to and did not reach claims under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.984" offset="7738864">The District Court of Appeals disagreed with him, and reversed that part of his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.105" offset="7763314">That decision was set aside by the Supreme Court's grant of a hearing so that decision was vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.039" offset="7791109">The California Supreme Court expressly declined to discuss that issue because it passed straight to the preemption issue and held that the franchise investment law claims are not arbitrable under the anti-waiver clause in the franchise investment law, a clause copied from the Federal Securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.810" offset="7898211">It interpreted that clause in the same way that this Court did in Wilko v. Swan and concluded that the California legislature intended to provide a special judicial forum for claims under that Act just as in the securities law and then went on to conclude that the Federal Arbitration Act was not inconsistent therewith because Congress had announced or enacted similar policies to the franchise investment law in securities cases and others.</text>

            <text syncTime="2063.324" offset="8396209">There is no question but what the policy of the federal government as exemplified in the Federal Arbitration Act and the policy of the government of the State of California as exemplified by its arbitration statute is that generally speaking agreements to arbitrate future disputes are valid and enforceable except on grounds that might invalidate contracts generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.328" offset="8504251">Congress and the state legislature in fact the legislatures I am told by the amicus briefs some 38 states have enacted legislation in the securities field which the franchise investment law is very analogous to which include that same provision that persons who bring claims under these remedial statutes are not obliged to arbitrate those claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="2140.652" offset="8705499">The Securities Act specifically provides for concurrent jurisdiction on issues of securities violations by the state and the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.379" offset="8768402">Of course the extent that Congress and the Securities Exchange Commission have occupied the field, any legislation to the contrary by a state would be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.202" offset="8819706">But these state statutes are essentially the same as the federal statutes in purpose and in effect, and quite apart from encouraging forum shopping the conclusion if the Supreme Court of California's decision is upheld, the decision that Southland is asking for is the one that would encourage forum shopping because as I understand their position it is that while Congress may have a policy and may include anti-waiver provisions in its securities statute in order to protect the person who is in the weaker bargaining position and ensure him his day in court, the state legislatures who are encouraged to pass these concurrent and overlapping securities statutes are not entitled to pursue that same policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.473" offset="9084797">That would result in the same claim that came into the federal court being not arbitrable but if it was brought in the state court under the state securities law it would be required to be arbitrated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2268.317" offset="9216245">The clause in question... The Supreme Court of California specifically declined to rule on that issue, but it is an issue that was in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.720" offset="9269848">It was always contended by us that this clause does not include claims under the franchise investment law for this reason, and I think it is a very valid reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.574" offset="9321257">The arbitrator has only the power that is given him by the arbitration agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2304.569" offset="9361172">He can only do what the parties have agreed that he may do, and in this case although the preamble section or the introductory section of this clause says that he may arbitrate all issues which arise out of or relate to the agreement while you might say that is broad enough to embrace claims under the franchise investment law because they have a relationship to the agreement it goes on and gives him the authority only to award damages for breach of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.493" offset="9496905">There is nothing in the arbitration agreement which gives him any authority to award damages for misrepresentations leading up to the agreement that are required by the franchise investment law, and that is a respect in which this arbitrator could not enforce the provisions of the franchise investment law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2382.100" offset="9671298">But he clearly indicated as one of his grounds for that ruling that he thought the agreement would not reach claims under the franchise investment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.784" offset="9722080">Furthermore, another clause in another part of the arbitration clause provides that nothing herein shall authorize the arbitrator to vary or modify or supplement any of the terms of this contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2439.545" offset="9901071">That is a remedy that the arbitrator would not be able to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.169" offset="9919566">So the result would be that the Plaintiffs here would be giving up more than and they would be waiving more than their right to a judicial forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.742" offset="9969930">They would be waiving substantive claims, rights that have been given them by the legislature under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.973" offset="9998769">That, of course, is one of the reasons that the federal courts including this Court have decided in a line of cases that there are certain types of claims, remedial statutes which were intended to protect persons in a weaker bargaining position such as the securities laws that those claims are not required to be arbitrated by the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.994" offset="10110887">One of the reasons for that is that arbitrators are peculiarly not well suited.</text>

            <text syncTime="2569.556" offset="10421117">That same clause was so interpreted by this Court in Wilko v. Swan when that clause was found in the Securities Act of 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.003" offset="10466988">I thought that there was no issue left as to whether that was not an appropriate decision that parties may not waive by means of an arbitration agreement executed prior to the event prior to the dispute arising the right to a judicial forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.215" offset="10543788">There is... Leaving the matter of the preliminary inquiry as to the interpretation of the arbitration clause and turning for a moment to the question assuming for the sake of argument which we may do that the arbitration clause did not reach these claims under the franchise investment law, now the question becomes in light of the California Supreme Court's decision that such claims are not arbitrable is that somehow preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.490" offset="10756842">That is a question really of whether there is a conflict between the federal law and policy and the state law and policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.768" offset="10785995">Our position on that is that there is no such conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.907" offset="10802505">Each has the same proarbitration policy as represented by the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.480" offset="10844823">The state courts are every bit as zealous in protecting, that is the California courts at least, are every bit as zealous in protecting the rights to arbitrate under a pre-dispute arbitration agreements as are the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.225" offset="10907830">The behavior of the courts in this case is a good example of that because we attacked the arbitration agreement when it was asserted as a basis for preventing or going forward with a class action on grounds that Southland had waived their rights under the statute and on evidence which was very strong in some of these cases of waiver because Southland had gone ahead and litigated the case in the courts and taken depositions for weeks and months in certain of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.634" offset="11029456">The California courts nevertheless held in this case that there was no waiver of the right to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.148" offset="11055474">When presented with the adhesion contract argument in this case, the California court leaned over backwards to protect the rights of the parties to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.689" offset="11105734">Although finding that this arbitration clause was in an adhesion contract, the California Supreme Court nevertheless refused to say that it was invalid and unenforceable unless perhaps it would be so if it had the effect of defeating the effect, the right to a class remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.369" offset="11180444">By the same token both jurisdictions, the federal courts and the state courts, have the same policy the same set of laws in the field of securities regulation, franchise regulation and others that recognize that in certain situations where you are dealing with important statutory rights whether it be under the securities laws, anti-trust laws, Fair Labor Standards Act, bankruptcy laws notwithstanding the strong policy in favor of arbitration these are claims that are not suited to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.084" offset="11371242">Arbitration is not appropriate, and it is not the federal policy under the Federal Arbitration Act to require arbitration in those cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.380" offset="12784467">That will be necessarily the case because everything has some effect on interstate commerce and in the course of doing so adopt a policy which is identical to that of the Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.175" offset="12959592">We are dealing with state legislatures who have declared in this particular situation our citizens are entitled to a judicial forum where that was true on the federal side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.171" offset="13007657">But in any case we have a case that is exactly analogous to Wildo v. Swan and these other federal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.869" offset="13050394">Finally, there is the matter if I may now turn to the other side of the case, that is, the set of issues that come here under the common law claims assuming now for the sake of argument again that some claims are going to be arbitrated in this case whether they be claims under the federal franchise investment law or the common law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.922" offset="13154570">Now the question that Southland raises is since the arbitration agreement in question is covered by the Federal Arbitration Act is this notion of the California Supreme Court that there can be a class-wide arbitration something that is so contrary to the very nature of an arbitration as a method for dispute resolution that it must violate the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution since the Federal Arbitration Act would preempt any state policy to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.577" offset="13317260">Now on that issue I have several things to say about that, but the most important thing is that issue does not belong here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.071" offset="13363236">I do not believe that it raises any significant federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.538" offset="13385074">It was an issue that was never raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.615" offset="13401375">The preemption argument on the issue of class-wide arbitration was never raised by Southland in the trial court or in the Supreme Court of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.518" offset="13440976">To be sure it was recognized by both sides that the Federal Arbitration Act, at least the substantive provisions thereof, would cover the question of arbitrability, that is, that it applied to this contract since it affected commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.745" offset="13513910">Our position was then and it is now and has always been that it really does not make any difference on the substantive side whether the Federal Arbitration Act or the state Arbitration Act applied because we find no difference between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.144" offset="13579530">We have found no case or statement of policy interpreting the California Arbitration Act that is any different from the statements and interpretations of this or the other federal courts in interpreting the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.685" offset="13633656">It is very clear that state courts apply their own procedures in enforcing the Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.322" offset="13672212">That was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.760" offset="13677959">You look to the California Court of Civil Procedure to determine how to go about filing a motion to compel arbitration or to obtain a judgment on the basis of an arbitration award.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.192" offset="13723726">There are various things in both of these statutes that are appropriate in the procedures of that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.877" offset="13746400">Here in the state court you do not apply the Rules of Federal Procedure nor if you are in the federal court visa versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.374" offset="13776389">But the question of... So the only extent to which Southland ever referred to or treated this as a federal question in the California courts was to recognize that the Federal Arbitration Act, and they claimed that on the issue of whether or not you could have a class arbitration they represented to the California courts that that was a question to be decided under state law and that since there was no authority for it in the California Code of Civil Procedure that it should not be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.496" offset="13972934">We responded to the same question by the District Court of Appeals as to which law applied by saying that it did not matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.961" offset="14006789">We could find no difference between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.460" offset="14012745">We assumed that California law would apply and argued by analogy that the Fderal Rules of Civil Procedure would provide some guidance to the California courts in developing a class remedy just as the California courts have looked to Rule 23 of idd Federal Rules in developing the class remedy generally in court actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.731" offset="14101874">So first and foremost it was never raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.136" offset="14119429">It is not discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.886" offset="14122459">The issue of preemption, the contention that the Federal Arbitration Act preempts this and prevents the Supreme Cout of the State of California from remanding this case to the trial court to consider the desirability of a hybrid kind of class arbitration was never raised as a federal issue as a constitutional question below--</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.719" offset="14213783">But even if it were not only is there no final judgment there is not any judgment of any kind except the remand to the trial court to consider the alternative ways to deal with the fact that we have conflicting policies that the California courts recognize as important, the importance of preserving the parties' rights to arbitration if they have agreed to arbitrate and the importance of providing a class remedy for persons in the position of these franchisees when dealing with their franchisor, a large corporation like Southland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.532" offset="14373025">It is a kind of situation that is perfect for the class remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.124" offset="14391416">If there can be no class remedy then one of two things will happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.045" offset="14407089">Either there will be a large number of individual arbitrations or as Southland hopes there will be a handful of arbitrations because other people do not know they have a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.493" offset="14452856">But the class remedy... The California Supreme Court said in that situation if the effect of the arbitration clause is going to be to defeat the class remedy then perhaps the arbitration clause under general principles of contract law as we understand them should be declared invalid because of the principles applicable to adhesion contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.436" offset="14548673">So it sent the entire thing back to the trial court who had not considered any of these issues to decide among the alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.808" offset="14578139">Shall there be consolidation of arbitrations which is clearly recognized by the federal rules and the California court says would also be available under the California Code of Civil Procedure?</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.036" offset="14639056">Should there be a single arbitration or some class arbitration under court supervision?</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.251" offset="14679912">That is a possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.219" offset="14683778">Possibly the arbitration clause should be stricken or it should be voided because of the principles applicable to adhesion contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.841" offset="14718260">A hearing will have to be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.699" offset="14725678">Evidence will have to be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.746" offset="14733933">A trial judge will have to consider what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.996" offset="14742919">In that posture it seems to me that it would not be wise for this Court to try to deal with the constitutional claim that somehow objectives or policies under the Federal Arbitration Act have been interfered with and the preemption doctrine should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.720" offset="14837796">Unless there are further questions, that will conclude my presentation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3688.697" offset="14897669">Mr. Spooner, before you begin supposing that Southland in this case instead of dealing with franchisees had been dealing with new employees and had handed to each one when they came to work an agreement to arbitrate any claim of injury arising out of or in the course of their employment and then one of them sustained an injury and went to the Industrial Accident Commission in California and Southland pleaded you have to arbitrate this and the California court said no we just do not allow anything except Industrial Accident Commission proceedings for industrial injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.434" offset="15032669">Do you think the Federal Arbitration Act would require arbitration to prevail there?</text>

            <text syncTime="3726.604" offset="15049388">Well, the first question would be whether that employment agreement involved interstate commerce.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="3736.350" offset="15088362">--The second question would be whether a provision in Section 1 of the Federal Arbitration Act would exempt this class of case from the scope of the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.424" offset="15144578">Section 1 provides that it shall not be applicable to the contracts of workers engaged in seamen's contracts and other interstate transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.695" offset="15229737">The scope of that exemption for workers claims has never been construed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.255" offset="15259935">It might be construed not to apply to that situation.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3784.393" offset="15280519">Well, assume that was not exempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="3785.878" offset="15286475">If it was not exempt and if the contract satisfied the general doctrines of contract formation, it was not forced upon them by undue means then our position would be that the federal Act controls and the agreement should be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.227" offset="15375814">The Plaintiffs argue here that there are federal situations in which certain types of claims have been held not to be appropriate for arbitration and they try to suggest that there is some sort of a broad exemption for statutory claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.609" offset="15465362">That simply is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.781" offset="15474034">This Court has held in only a very few situations that particular federal claims are not suited for arbitration, and it has done that only after carefully analyzing congressional intent in the particular statute involved.</text>
