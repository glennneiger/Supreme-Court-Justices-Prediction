            <text syncTime="17.479" offset="211446">This case involves an admittedly unprecedented order of the Federal Reserve Board, reversing 50 years of administrative understanding, and industry understanding permitting bank affiliates, for the first time in half a century--</text>

            <text syncTime="31.410" offset="267139">How can it be unprecedented if you reverse something?</text>

            <label>Mr. James B. Weidner</label>
            <text syncTime="34.049" offset="277692">--Unprecedented in terms of reversing the understanding, but not unprecedented in terms of reversing a prior administrative ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.031" offset="309666">Involved are two statutes fundamental to the governing of the banking industry, and financial services industry in this country, the Bank Holding Company Act and the Glass-Steagall Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.087" offset="365882">In this case, directly contrary to congressional intent, in our view, the Board of Governors, affirmed by the Second Circuit, turned two narrow exceptions in the statutes into broad authorizations instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.753" offset="424500">We believe that the decision below should be reversed for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.268" offset="442577">First, the Bank Holding Company Act requires that any bank affiliate, which is not a bank, be involved in a business that is so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.450" offset="499315">That has been interpreted and requires that that business be closely related in the sense of being... of having a direct and significant connection to banking, and not similar... not simply being related to it in the sense of being functionally similar, which is what the Board found.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.800" offset="576742">Secondly, we believe that the Glass-Steagall Act prevents any affiliation of a bank with an entity that is principally engaged in the public securities business, and that is the business in which the affiliate here involved is here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.763" offset="640585">Briefly, the facts are these: In early 1982, the BankAmerica Corporation, owner of BankAmerica, one of the largest banks in the world, applied to the Federal Reserve Board for permission to acquire the Charles Schwab Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.318" offset="702757">Schwab is the owner of one of the largest, if not the largest discount brokers in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.114" offset="721983">The SIA, our client, opposed the application and requested a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.236" offset="746433">The Federal Reserve Board ordered a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.000" offset="765451">The Law Judge ruled in favor of the proposed acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.968" offset="781333">The Second Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.045" offset="793663">If I may, let me first address the Bank Holding Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.745" offset="812471">That Act was passed in 1956 to further the basic congressional purpose of separating banking from commerce in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.304" offset="850714">By that Act, Congress said that banks will not evade that separation through the structure of a bank holding company, and said that a bank holding company could not acquire a non-banking subsidiary unless... a very narrow exception... that subsidiary's business was so closely related to the business of banking to be a proper incident thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.325" offset="958757">The Board of Governors interpreted that statute for the next decade as requiring a direct and significant connection between the proposed activity of the subsidiary and the activity of the bank holding company itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.098" offset="1025839">In 1969, the Board asked Congress to amend the statute to loosen up the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.284" offset="1050603">They found it to be too restrictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.048" offset="1057709">What they proposed was that the closely related standard be changed to read "functionally related", and that the phase "the business of" be deleted from the phrase</text>
            <text syncTime="243.855" offset="1116954">"closely related to the business of banking. "</text>
            <text syncTime="246.214" offset="1126358">The House and the Senate both passed bills, which in fact did substitute "functionally related" for "closely related", but there were significant differences between those bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.959" offset="1173274">One of the most significant differences was that the House said: We will put functionally related in, but we are also going to have what became known as a laundry list of prohibited activities that in no case will be deemed closely related to banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.531" offset="1227609">The result was a conference committee, of course, and what can only be described as a legislative Donnybrook.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.185" offset="1254254">Clearly there was a battle in the Conference Committee as to which view would prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.308" offset="1278704">In fact, the compromise was reached only after a virtual stalemate.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.384" offset="1298975">The obvious deal that was cut was this:</text>
            <text syncTime="292.117" offset="1309947">The Conference agreed to leave out "the business of" from the "business of banking", but in return for that, and in return for the House members deleting their laundry list of prohibited activities, the proposed functionally related test was out and the original "closely related" language was left in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.748" offset="1396464">A review of the legislative history makes clear... It is a little bit difficult to discern all of the ramifications of what happened, but one thing, I believe, is absolutely clear from the legislative history, and that is that Congress did not substitute "functionally related" for "closely related" in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.522" offset="1479534">The Congressional Report... The Conference Committee Report makes clear that the Board was given greater flexibility in the sense that by deleting "the business of" from the statute, no longer did a connection a connection have to be shown between the specific holding company and the proposed activity, but that a direct and significant connection continued to be required between banking in general and the proposed activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.416" offset="1595204">That is the connection that could not be found here.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.149" offset="1606071">The specific business that is at issue is execution of securities trade for the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.209" offset="1626342">That is a business that banks have not been in for the last 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.880" offset="1645046">It was not on the basis that banks generally have been in the business that the Board found, or could find this acquisition to be permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.534" offset="1675661">Instead, the Board found it permissible because, in its view, the activities involved here were functionally similar to other activities performed by banks, so that at least some banks were well-equipped to perform them.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.450" offset="1735325">I suggest what has happened is that the Board... This is not a mere matter of interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.604" offset="1759880">The Board has in fact put back in the statute exactly the language that the Congress refused to accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.460" offset="1787361">We have a Board, in effect, amendment of statute directly contrary to legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.395" offset="1815051">It is not simply that it is contrary to legislative intent, but I suggest, if anything, "functionally similar" is even broader than "functionally related".</text>
            <text syncTime="428.673" offset="1856220">For example, if all that is necessary to be shown is that the bank, or at least some banks have the capacity to perform some activity and, therefore, it is closely related.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.261" offset="1898538">Banks have the capacity and do execute wire transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.790" offset="1916615">Then why couldn't it be argued that they should be able to go into the telecommunications business, and that is not a farfetched example.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.037" offset="1949633">The American Bankers Association... this is in our brief... has in fact asked the Federal Reserve Board to approve, as a bank affiliate activity, telecommunication services.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.392" offset="1991011">It seems to me that the next thing we are going to hear is that because banks have dispensed toaster and calculators to get depositors to put money in the bank, then they can go into the retail toaster business.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.467" offset="2031344">In a more serious vein, I really do believe that this is virtually a limitless standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.215" offset="2054332">The Board has pointed to this Court's decision in what we have called ICI-2 as authority for its standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.539" offset="2087664">But the fact it, the activity involved there, investment advice to a closed and mutual fund, was an activity that banks had done for 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.911" offset="2125176">Indeed, this Court specifically said that in looking at future applications, the Board was to assure that the bank affiliate did not exceed bank's traditional fiduciary functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.796" offset="2176690">In this case, however, there is no doubt that securities execution is not a traditional banking function.</text>

          </turn>

            <label>Mr. James B. Weidner</label>
            <text syncTime="525.164" offset="2242100">No, Justice O'Connor, I don't believe that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.585" offset="2251818">To the extent that banks have had an involvement in "brokerage" over the years, their involvement has simply been to accommodate orders of bank customers to sell stock or securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.329" offset="2310855">But in doing that, they have uniformly forwarded the orders to brokers for execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.435" offset="2339276">There is a significant difference here because a broker who executes a trade puts his net capital on the line every time he does that.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.057" offset="2377728">In other words, whether it is one time a day or 100,000 times a day, each time that trade executed that broker has got to come up with the securities or cash to make good in the trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.381" offset="2419002">If his customer doesn't have it, the broker has got to come up with the money or the securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.317" offset="2438750">It is for that reason... Turning to Glass-Steagall just for a moment, because I think it does respond to your question, although it is not in the Bank Holding Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.923" offset="2473232">The Glass-Steagall Act was amended, and I will return to this, to limit bank securities activities to purchasing and selling, without recourse upon the order and for the account of customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.135" offset="2534045">The question is what does "without recourse" mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="601.461" offset="2547315">This Court addressed... In its technical sense, it means without endorsement or guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.022" offset="2569571">But this Court addressed that specific requirement in the Awotin case, and expressly flatly held that without recourse, in this context, in this statute, its predecessor, is not limited solely to endorsement and guarantee because it would make any sense in terms of trading and securities, which are not typically endorsed or guaranteed.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.341" offset="2658806">Certainly stock is not endorsed or guaranteed.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.527" offset="2671553">It said it had a broader meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.182" offset="2678241">Then the question is, what is the analogous liability that a broker might face to a third party, if it is not endorsement or guarantee?</text>
            <text syncTime="645.522" offset="2723589">The analogous liability is exactly the risk of customer fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.879" offset="2745010">The broker has got to come up with the securities or stock to the third person if his customer doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.815" offset="2764758">It is exactly that kind of liability which we believe Congress expressly legislated against in the Glass-Steagall Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.888" offset="2797046">The way that a bank or a broker can accomplish avoiding that liability, and many brokers do, is acting as a forwarding broker, that is to say, the broker gets a securities order, forwards it to an executing broker on a so-called fully disclosed basis... that is disclosing the name of the customer to the executing broker... who then deals directly with the customer, account statements, confirmations, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.411" offset="2895162">There is no recourse against the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.708" offset="2904357">In fact, I should point out... this is something that has happened since our reply brief was filed on the same day... the Comptroller of Currency, in a proposed rulemaking reported at 49 Federal Register 15089, has proposed regulations to deal with bank securities activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.873" offset="2985023">One of the things that the Comptroller said in that regulation a week ago was that no bank will conduct a securities business in-house, except on a fully disclosed basis, that is to say, forwarding the orders to brokers for execution, which is what banks have done on an incidental accommodation basis for years, and that, I suggest, is what the Comptroller understands "without recourse" means in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.424" offset="3095155">To return to where we started, no, I don't believe that banks have been in the business of executing securities orders for the public at any point until they were allowed to be affiliated with Schwab only two years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="790.263" offset="3302567">It had direct relevance because a question, turning now to the Glass-Steagall Act, is exactly what did Congress mean to prohibit in that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.040" offset="3337676">In our view, without going to the background of the Glass-Steagall Act, of course, it was a reaction to the crash of '29 and the economic chaos and bank failures that followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.177" offset="3374247">In our view, Congress meant to prevent banks from doing certain securities activities entirely, and from affiliating with entities who are principally in those securities activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.298" offset="3426701">The question, then, is what were banks prevented from doing and how does that relate to their affiliates.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.154" offset="3446136">Perhaps I could step back just brief to 1927, because the story really start there with the McFadden Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.152" offset="3474140">In 1927, Congress passed the McFadden Act, which for the first time authorized banks to deal in securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.617" offset="3507994">Significantly, it authorized banks to deal only in investment securities, that is; low risk debt securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.847" offset="3548850">At no point had Congress authorized banks to deal in stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.048" offset="3565673">The only thing that banks were doing at that time was, on an informal basis, accommodating customers who may have inherited some stock, or whatever, by passing along those orders to a broker for execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.763" offset="3620530">By 1933, after the chaos had occurred, Congress, in effect, realized that it had made a mistake, and in the Glass-Steagall Act withdrew the securities powers that it had granted in the McFadden Act of 1927, and said that banks shall not deal in investment securities, except to the limited extent of purchasing and selling, without recourse, upon the order and for the account of their customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.626" offset="3727945">I won't return to "without recourse", but it seems to us from the face of it that it is clear that that language meant that a customer... that a bank was merely to pass a customer's orders along for execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.856" offset="3776951">But there really can't be much doubt about what was done, in our view, because immediately after the Glass-Steagall Act passed, the Comptroller of Currency, who is responsible, of course, for all national banks, said: Look, wait a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.460" offset="3827315">I think that you may have gone too far, because if you read that proviso, the exception to dealing literally, it says that a bank may accommodate only orders in investment securities, not stock, and said the Comptroller, that is pretty important in rural areas where a bank may be the only financial institution in miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.434" offset="3919266">There isn't a brokerage house on the corner.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.934" offset="3925222">Won't you clarify your intent, in effect, he said, and make it clear that banks can continue to accommodate on this informal basis orders and stock, as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.664" offset="3968167">He proposed legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.273" offset="3974541">In 1934, both the House and Senate passed bills that incorporated it, but it floundered on the last day of the session.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.957" offset="4001291">The Comptroller then issued a rulemaking interpretation that said, in effect, in my view Congress didn't mean to prevent accommodating orders on stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.235" offset="4038384">I am going to permit it and return to Congress, in effect, next year to get it expressly permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.810" offset="4060745">But, said the Comptroller in that ruling, this does not mean banks may do a brokerage business.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.793" offset="4088644">That was in July 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.260" offset="4098571">In August, I believe it was, or September 1934, the Federal Reserve Board ruled similarly and specifically quoted the Comptroller's language.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.882" offset="4137023">In 1934, the Comptroller did return to Congress, testified that in his view this was necessary to expand this exception, and made clear that it was only on an accommodation basis, and convinced Congress to expand the statute to include purchasing and selling, without recourse, on the orders, securities and stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.998" offset="4221451">Under this Court's precedent, in Zuber against Allen, it seems to me that that history itself should be controlling, if there were ambiguity, we don't think there is, as to what Congress intended in the exception in Section 16 for accommodating stock orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.100" offset="4285921">The Comptroller proposed the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.834" offset="4296788">He testified directly before the Congressional Committees that were considering it, what his view was, and Congress enacted what he proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.519" offset="4327612">The respondents say, wait a minute, in 1933, the Congressional Reports that accompanied the initial Glass-Steagall Act said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.389" offset="4363034">"Banks shall be permitted, to the same extent heretofore, to deal in securities. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.464" offset="4391351">therefore that shows that they were permitted to be public stockbrokers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.432" offset="4407233">But let's look at what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.306" offset="4414757">Banks had not been permitted prior to 1933 to broker stock, or prior to any date to broker stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.443" offset="4451224">They had been permitted only to deal in investment securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.333" offset="4466793">The Comptroller made that clear, he made clear what he had in mind, that is an accommodation provision limitation during 1934 and 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.110" offset="4505976">The 35 Amendment that added stock... expanded the exception to add stock, was specifically characterized as a technical amendment intended to make no substantive changes in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.667" offset="4560206">If respondents are correct that what Congress intended to do was to permit banks to be public stock brokers, it would necessarily mean that in 1935, when Congress passed a technical, non-substantive amendment to a statute, the Glass-Steagall Act, otherwise meant broadly to prohibit securities activities for banks, it authorized, for the only time in 200 years, banks to become public stockbrokers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.123" offset="4681937">I suggest that simply doesn't make common sense, let alone legislative history sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1153.038" offset="4753617">Justice O'Connor, we clearly are dealing with a bank affiliate, and let me turn to Section 20, which deals specifically with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.457" offset="4779322">Let me say this that in our view the structure and the history of the Glass-Steagall make it clear that what Congress had in mind was, given... remember that when this was passed, given the crash and the 2,000 banks that failed in the interim, to get banks out of the securities business, and it did it by prohibiting certain activities entirely for banks, and prohibiting them principally for their affiliates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.711" offset="4884334">There is no history, although this is in effect what we believe the Board and the Second Circuit have held, no history, legislative or statutory, that suggests that the Board has discretion to authorize bank affiliates to engage principally in what banks can't engage in at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.221" offset="4954342">That we believe is what has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.548" offset="4963642">I might contrast Section 20 with Section 32 that has to do with interlocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.811" offset="4980778">Section 20 has to do with bank affiliations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.388" offset="4991018">Section 32 did vest the Board with exemptive authority over certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.981" offset="5013379">Let me turn to Section 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.917" offset="5021111">As I said, that statute... that section has to do with bank affiliations, part of the Glass-Steagall Act, and provides that a bank may not be affiliated with any entity</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.708" offset="5076282">"engaged principally in the issue, floatation, underwriting, public sale, distribution. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.690" offset="5100210">and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.486" offset="5103449">I will come back to the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.486" offset="5107420">In our view, that language covers the waterfront in terms of activities, including public brokerage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.091" offset="5145872">It says, "public sale".</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.216" offset="5154335">It is a remedial statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.262" offset="5162590">The statute should be construed broadly, and indeed every time this Court has assessed the Glass-Steagall Act, it has said that its provisions are indeed to be read as remedial provisions, broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.554" offset="5211700">What the government... the respondents say is, now wait, public brokerage wasn't covered by that because... Let me turn to the Second Circuit first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.470" offset="5259348">The Second Circuit said, it is not covered because the terms apply only to principal activities, as opposed to agency activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.686" offset="5292262">Underwriting, for example, they said, is a principal activity, and so on, so brokerage is out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.168" offset="5314205">But the fact is that underwriting certainly encompasses, and the Board doesn't dispute, best effort underwriting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.493" offset="5347433">That is an agency, not a principal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.007" offset="5361539">And there is no reason why a public sale couldn't equally well be an agency as well as a principal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.380" offset="5391005">The Board, apparently recognizing the problem in the Second Circuit opinion in that respect, doesn't support it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.454" offset="5419322">They have a different view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.360" offset="5422979">Their view is that those terms concern themselves only with new issues of stock or the introduction of large blocks of stock to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.107" offset="5457878">In other words, public offerings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.809" offset="5464775">The problem with that interpretation is what they are saying in essence is that it covers only primary distributions of stock... the first time stock is made available to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.899" offset="5509078">If that is the case, they have just eliminated half of the securities industry from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.990" offset="5533424">The entire secondary market where stocks are traded once they are out in public hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.863" offset="5556935">If that is the case, and that is necessarily what they are saying, that means not only could bank affiliates principally be stockbrokers, but they could be dealers, that is, trading for their own account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.107" offset="5609911">They can even be market-makers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.888" offset="5617016">Even the Federal Reserve Board has said in its amended Reg Y that dealing is not a permitted activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.682" offset="5648259">One further thing, I think, bears upon Section 20 to contrast it with Section 32, the interlock provision, which as of 1935 used the same phrase as Section 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.114" offset="5697996">Its predecessor language... the predecessor in '32 as enacted in 1933... said, purchasing, selling, and negotiating, not issuance, floatation, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.905" offset="5757137">That amendment was also a technical, non-substantive amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.638" offset="5772079">If, as the Board says, the statutory phrase now means only underwriting, then necessarily Section 32 must have meant the same thing in 1933 when it was initially passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.836" offset="5824846">Then the statute falls apart, because Section 16, which we talked about before relating to agency activities, uses the terms "purchasing and selling", clearly relating to agency activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.377" offset="5878972">In other words, I think if you look at the statute as a whole, there is only one construction that makes sense and it makes sense in terms of the general congressional intent as well, that is, and if I may let me read Section 20 in its entirety,</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.420" offset="5927142">"May not affiliate with an entity principally engaged in the issue, floatation, underwriting, public sale, or distribution at wholesale or retail, or through syndicate participation of stocks, bonds, debentures, notes, or other securities. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.301" offset="6010734">I suggest that what Congress had in mind was covering the waterfront.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.003" offset="6029542">It meant to prevent principal engaging at all activities, whether they are principal or agent, in all markets, whether primary or secondary, and in all securities, whether they are equity or debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.013" offset="6093594">I think any other construction of that statutory phrase throws this language out of kilter and, I respectfully suggest, congressional intent out the window.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.664" offset="6136122">In summary, we believe that the Federal Reserve Board, affirmed by the Second Circuit, was incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.739" offset="6160468">Schwab is unquestionably principally engaged in the execution of securities trades for the public, the public securities brokerage business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.517" offset="6195576">They have reached that conclusion by turning very narrow exceptions, "closely related" in the Bank Holding Company Act, "purchase and sale" in the Glass-Steagall Act, into broad authorizations instead, never intended by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.387" offset="6259002">In effect, they are trying to turn the clock back to 1927, when Congress had permitted... even further, to permit dealings in stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.680" offset="6296200">I suggest that if the legislative clock is to be turned back, that is a policy decision of enormous consequences that should be addressed by Congress only, and in fact Congress is right now looking in an omnibus fashion to the financial services industry to see if and, if so, how that industry should be restructured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.656" offset="6384076">I believe the decision below should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1571.855" offset="6428902">At issue in this case is the Federal Reserve Board's determination, made on the basis of an exhaustive administrative record, that the business of executing securities transactions on exchanges is closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto, and that such brokerage activities are not prohibited to bank holding companies or their subsidiaries by the Glass-Steagall Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.485" offset="6523465">In that regard, it is probably worthwhile to emphasize once more, as Justice O'Connor did with her question, to remember that this case concerns only a bank holding company and its subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.809" offset="6568709">It does not involve the bank and, therefore, precisely what banks are permitted to do, and have engaged in, in the past is not directly controlling on the outcome of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1665.847" offset="6804856">But I think that if it is so closely related to banking that a bank would be perfectly well suited to engage in that form of activity that that would be fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.126" offset="6837980">Especially if, as in this case, the reason why banks are not engaged in that activity are not so much dependent on the law as they are on the financial events that gave rise to the problem in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.979" offset="6885418">I think that it is important to understand what the Board did here to place it in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.759" offset="6908510">In the 1970s, the Securities and Exchange Commission unfixed the fees that brokers charge... can charge on their... for executing transactions on the stock exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.504" offset="6947485">This pro-consumer decision led directly to the creation a new form of financial opportunity from this discount brokerage, a firm such as Schwab emerged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.892" offset="6989072">Prior to that time, it was generally not possible to offer fewer services for a lesser fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.233" offset="7006417">In the early 1980s, BankAmerica, realizing what an opportunity this presented, made an application to the Federal Reserve Board to acquire the Charles Schwab Discount Brokerage firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.354" offset="7050930">The Board published notice of the proposed acquisition and solicited comments from the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.852" offset="7072873">You may regard it as probably worthwhile, and this will also reemphasize again that this case involves bank holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.397" offset="7095129">It is important to note that the Securities and Exchange Commission expressly passed judgment on this particular issue, and did not oppose the acquisition of Schwab by BankAmerica's Holding Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1821.614" offset="7427929">It is our view that procedurally and substantively, the Board's action were precisely what Congress envisioned when it rejected the House's attempt to narrowly constrain the Board's discretion in dealing with the what is closely related to banking by bank holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.296" offset="7494698">That determination is left to the experience and the expertise of the Federal Reserve Board, and it has made a judgment in this case as to what businesses can properly be integrated under the umbrella of a bank holding company.</text>

            <text syncTime="2045.496" offset="8323511">But there is not one word in the legislative history to suggest that Congress had any concern about mere brokerage activities by banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.618" offset="8351932">The entire debates in 1933 and again in 1956 relate to the problems of market, market collapse of large issues of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.100" offset="8389862">There is no reference in any of that history to the mere execution of a brokerage transaction, and there is no reason for any concern, because banks did not fail in the late 1920s and 1930s... in the early 1930s because they executed transactions on securities exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.108" offset="8461960">Banks failed because they engaged in investment banking practices where purchased large quantities of securities and those securities went bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.495" offset="8499472">That is precisely what Congress prohibited, not anything related to the simple execution of transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.524" offset="8527580">Indeed, Congress expressly allows banks, under Section 16, to purchase and sell securities as agents for their customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.816" offset="8560703">Under the Glass-Steagall Act, it seems to us that, notwithstanding petitioner's repeated reliance on Section 16, that the only relevant provision is Section 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.217" offset="8622352">Section 16, by its terms, relates only to national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.449" offset="8639279">Section 21, also relied upon by petition, only relates to the receipt of deposits, and it is undisputed that Schwab nor BankAmerica do not receive deposits, and neither has the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.430" offset="8687240">Therefore, it makes meaningless, the plain meaning role, to argue, as petitioner does, that the restrictions imposed under those provisions should be borrowed and applied willy-nilly to the activities of a bank holding company that has its own specific set or provisions to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.296" offset="8766652">And that provision is Section 20... Section 20, by its terms, prohibits bank affiliates from underwriting, distributing, issuing, publicly selling, or floating blocks of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.227" offset="8830391">That is not an across-the-board condemnation of all securities activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.539" offset="8847632">That is a condemnation of public marketing activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.257" offset="8862469">If Congress had intended to preclude bank affiliates from engaging in brokerage activities, it would surely have said that brokerage activities are not permissible, or at least it would have used the term</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.815" offset="8912729">"purchase and sale of securities as agent. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.329" offset="8922760">just the commonly understood definition of brokerage functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.546" offset="8939687">Congress did none of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.435" offset="8947211">Instead, it drafted the language in a way that makes it unmistakably clear that it is intended to deal solely with underwriting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2213.759" offset="8996530">In characterizing the meaning of the identical language in Section 32 of the Act, this Court repeatedly described it as involving nothing but underwriting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2428.611" offset="9855958">Adherence to those principles requires the conclusion that this case can and should be resolved completely by reference to Section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.998" offset="9893470">By strongly urging the Court to limits its inquiry to Section 20, we do not, however, mean to imply that we shy away from scrutiny by this Court under Sections 16 or 21, by their terms they simply do not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.585" offset="9947805">But if, as petitioner seems all too often to assume, this case involved a national bank, our submission would be no different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.130" offset="9978002">Like their affiliates, national banks are prohibited from underwriting securities, but they are expressly authorized, as one of their many delegated powers, to purchase and sell securities on behalf of their customers as agent, and not for their own accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.436" offset="10039233">In other words, banks would appear to be able to serve as a broker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.419" offset="10055116">This grant of power was intended in 1933 to ratify preexisting practices of banks, and as we explained in some detail in our brief, it is clear that banks did engage in the purchase and sale of stock, and other securities, for customers prior to that time, and that is all that Congress meant to ratify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.598" offset="10135886">The division Congress made in the Glass-Steagall Act was between investment banking activities that carry a tremendous risk of loss if the market shifts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.079" offset="10173816">It did not intend to illuminate the rather minimal potential for liability, or was not worried about the potential... minimal potential liability of a broker having to cover for a customer who happens to place an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.745" offset="10232435">It may be, as petitioner suggested today, that brokerage firms place their entire assets at their disposal when they execute an order, but the record in this case reflects that less than 1 percent of all of the transactions executed by the Schwab brokerage firm... less than 1 percent involves situations where the customer fails to satisfy his own order or his own request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.171" offset="10334208">Accordingly, this is not a significant problem, and it is certainly not a problem Congress made any specific reference in anything in 1933 or 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.480" offset="10375377">Congress could not foresee in 1933 the discount brokerage activities would some day be profitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.461" offset="10407351">It seems to us quite clear from the language that it adopted, allowing for agency actions on the part of bank in executing... in the purchase and sale of securities that it would clearly have upheld and permitted the banks to engage in the kinds of activities that Schwab undertakes here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.970" offset="10485405">It seems to us that that interpretation, as I just mentioned to Justice White, is a reasonable one, and that is where this Court's inquiry should stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.200" offset="10518319">So long as the Comptroller's newest interpretation is reasonable, it is entitled to deference by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.683" offset="10544233">Petitioner conjures up the horrors of the bank failures of the 1930s and hints that the Board's decision here is based on arguments presented in connection with the regulatory and legislative decisions of the mid-1920s that led to that financial disaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.269" offset="10606613">But the Federal Reserve Board has not turned the clock back to 1927, nor created an environment of serious bank failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.719" offset="10636393">The Board has instead adjusted to the financial events of the 1970s and the 1980s, and acting faithfully to the congressional scheme created to allow substantial, but not unbridled, expansion of the business of banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.230" offset="10690414">It has presented a thorough and reasonable explanation for its approval of BankAmerica's application in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.790" offset="10716641">It is petitioner and the securities firms whom it represents who seek to stop the financial clock from moving beyond the events of the 1970s, when that industry as so structured that competition was severely limited, and the only role for a bank on the exchanges was to serve as an intermediary between the bank's customer and the broker, with the latter receiving the fee, but without any risk of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.108" offset="10809950">Those times are gone, and the securities industry must recognize that banks, and of particular significance to this case, bank holding companies and their affiliates are legitimate competitors in that discrete area of securities activity concerning the purchase and sale of stock as agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.601" offset="10879854">This change is not the product of regulatory fiat, but rather a reasonable application of the plain meaning of the statutes Congress adopted, and empowered the Board to use its expertise to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.674" offset="10928233">It is, therefore, not the Board's action that "should be legislated by Congress", as petitioner puts it, but rather petitioner's efforts to overturn the orderly decision of the Board that should be submitted to Congress for reevaluation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.918" offset="10985180">The Administrative Law Judge, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Second Circuit have all unanimously and correctly held that the discount brokerage activities are a legitimate part of the business of banking, which Congress did not intend to prohibit by Glass-Steagall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.881" offset="11049023">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>

          <turn speaker="james_b_weidner" startTime="2734.408" stopTime="2870.916">
            <label>Mr. James B. Weidner</label>
            <text syncTime="2734.408" offset="11079116">If I may, several brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.470" offset="11087371">Justice O'Connor, if I could respond briefly to the question of the Morgan Bank and Brown Brothers Harriman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.593" offset="11111821">So far as we know, there are... there were two banks that were on the exchange, and two kept their seats, but I don't think we can draw from that an inference that it was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.184" offset="11146198">First of all, remember the Comptroller specifically prohibited them from engaging in public securities brokerage, so it is unlikely that they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.540" offset="11179635">Second, there is no evidence that they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.913" offset="11189144">Third, there is a perfectly good economic reason why they would have retained their seats, even though they couldn't be public securities brokers, simply this, there are a lot of floor traders, or there were a lot of floor traders who had an exchange seat simply because when there were fixed commissions, if they traded on the floor themselves, they didn't have to pay any commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.328" offset="11266780">If, as an exchange member, they used the privilege of using a floor broker there, you only have pay 10 percent of the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.199" offset="11294260">So that, for example, for trust accounts and the like, it would make eminently good sense for Brown Brothers to have someone stay on the exchange when they weren't engaged in the public brokering of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.258" offset="11338564">Let me turn then briefly to the Comptroller's recent interpretation or reinterpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.834" offset="11364791">I suggest that any indication that the Comptroller thought, in 1934 and 1935, he was convincing Congress to allow banks to become public stock brokers, just is simply illogical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.249" offset="11414528">If it is true that it was important that banks, like all other corporations, couldn't be exchange members, only partnerships could be to avoid limited liability, then why was the Comptroller trying to convince Congress to allow banks to become public stock brokers when they couldn't do it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.604" offset="11479939">Well, maybe it was because he wanted them to trade in the over-the-counter market where they don't have to be exchange members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.428" offset="11507211">If that was his motive, then why did he issue a regulation immediately after the statute was amended specifically prohibiting them from being public stock brokers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.799" offset="11540647">It just doesn't make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.706" offset="11548275">Moreover, something that I didn't mention, but I think bears mention, is in 1934 Congress was considering the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 to govern public stock brokers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.623" offset="11587981">They excepted banks from the definition of broker in the '34 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.981" offset="11609402">Why would they do that if they thought banks could be public stockbrokers?</text>
