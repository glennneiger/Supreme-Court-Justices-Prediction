            <label>Ms. Carolyn Corwin</label>
            <text syncTime="47.388" offset="324125">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="51.496" offset="340530">The question raised in this case concerns the interpretation of 5 U.S.C. 8132, the reimbursement provision of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.349" offset="387969">Under Section 8132, a federal employee who has suffered a work-related injury, who has received FICA benefits on account of that injury, and who sues and recovers from a third party in connection with that injury, must reimburse the federal government out of his third party recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.388" offset="472083">The question here is whether that statutory duty to reimburse exists when state law provides that the third party recovery may not include damages for medical expenses and lost wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.992" offset="530493">Respondent is a government employee who was injured in a work-related automobile accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.770" offset="557660">He received FICA benefits in the amount of approximately $2,000 which allowed him to pay for his medical expenses and made up for his lost wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.845" offset="601859">Respondent then sued the driver of the other car and eventually settled for $8,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.139" offset="631117">The Secretary of Labor sought reimbursement for the FICA benefits that had been paid out in the amount of approximately $1,600, which represented the FICA benefits less a reasonable attorney's fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.835" offset="689840">Even though Respondent's recovery was more than five times the amount that the Secretary of Labor was seeking to be reimbursed, Respondent took the position that he did not have a duty to reimburse because his settlement did not include amounts that represented medical expenses and lost wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.906" offset="762147">That is because the Pennsylvania no-fault insurance statute abolishes tort liability for economic losses, including medical expenses and lost wages, that fall below the ceiling set by the Pennsylvania statute for no-fault coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.773" offset="837588">The district court held nevertheless that the statute Section 8132 did require Respondent to reimburse, citing the Ostrowski case from the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.690" offset="889311">The Third Circuit reversed and explicitly rejected the Ostrowski case.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.093" offset="914911">In the Third Circuit's view, the federal government was to be a model employer and that that was Congress' intent underlying the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.309" offset="947721">For that reason the Third Circuit thought that Section 8132 ought to be interpreted so that a federal employee would be at least as well off as an employee covered by the state workers' compensation system.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.991" offset="1002473">Because the Pennsylvania courts had held that under the state workers' compensation law a compensation carrier would not be subrogated to the rights of an employee in a situation like that of respondent, the court concluded that the Section 8132 of the federal statute should not... should be read in an analogous manner to the Pennsylvania law.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.201" offset="1095365">Our position in this case is a straightforward one.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.309" offset="1111770">First, we think that the language of Section 8132 on its face requires reimbursement from Respondent to the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.179" offset="1151267">Second, we think that contrary to what the court of appeals believed, the result is consistent with the purposes that underlie the reimbursement provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.066" offset="1190764">Now, the language of Section 8132 seems clearly to require reimbursement from anything that an employee recovers from a third party on account of his work-related injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.623" offset="1249069">That is how the Secretary of Labor has always read this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.778" offset="1265683">Section 8132 refers to money or other property an employee recovers--</text>

            <text syncTime="329.149" offset="1451152">And, of course, that language may refer back to just to the FICA liability, which is limited in nature to lost wages and medical benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.408" offset="1516145">Now, you can go back to the injury or death for which compensation is payable, but I think in terms of the damages or the money or other property, that refers to the liability of the third party.</text>

            <text syncTime="395.264" offset="1715616">And I think if you look at the statute, it refers to this injury or death for which compensation is payable.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.246" offset="1739544">Under the FICA system, FICA benefits take the place of damages for personal injury and not for property injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.992" offset="1774548">If someone... if someone's damages... property is damaged in a work-related situation, there is a separate provision in Title 31, Section 3721, I believe, that allows you to present a claim for your property damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.611" offset="1836929">But in terms of the compensation scheme we're talking about here, which is the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, those benefits are designed to take the place of what you would ordinarily get for your personal injury as a result of a work-related accident.</text>

            <text syncTime="463.830" offset="1989797">That is... that is typical of a statutory compensation scheme in that respect.</text>

            <text syncTime="544.079" offset="2310894">I was trying to find out whether the FICA statute is like I understand many state workmen's compensation statutes to be, kind of giving payment for things other than... than pain and suffering, or whether FICA is... if you took a FICA, the average actuarial value of a FICA, would it look very much like the actuarial value of a jury award in favor of a plaintiff?</text>

            <text syncTime="573.582" offset="2428863">And I think if you're comparing it to state schemes, it would be similar in the respect you've suggested; that when you're measuring the amount an employee gets, you generally look to the medical expenses incurred; you look to perhaps a payment on a schedule for disability; you look to some percentage of lost wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.606" offset="2504932">But... but in terms of the balance that's been struck by Congress, you have this... this lower amount of... of benefits compared to what you might recover in a tort situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.382" offset="2552057">On the other hand, you get it... you get it quickly; you get it without regard to fault; you get it without the need for litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.146" offset="2579120">So you strike the same sort of balance that you do in the state systems to which you refer.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Ms. Carolyn Corwin</label>
            <text syncTime="622.690" offset="2625304">--There is no amount of FICA benefits that is measured according to someone's recovery for pain and suffering.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.547" offset="2648710">There is also... there is no indication in the language of either differentiation among different types of damages or any suggestion that the right of reimbursement, the federal governments' right as against the third party recovery of the employee, no suggestion that that depends in any way on the substance or the nature of the employee's cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.301" offset="2751737">The bottom line is when we read 8131 is that anything you recover is then subject to this federal right of reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.470" offset="2788413">Now, Respondent has suggested that 8132 is merely an adjunct to Section 8131 which provides that the Secretary may require the employee to assign his right of action to the Secretary to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.712" offset="2853405">In fact, we think the two sections create somewhat different kinds of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.975" offset="2874408">But even if you do look to Section 8131 for guidance, we think our interpretation ought to prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.504" offset="2904501">The Secretary may require an assignment of the right of action, not just the employee's right to recover for medical expenses and lost wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.031" offset="2946610">The way assignment would work is that the Secretary, if he received an assignment, would recover any available damages, and that would include not only medical expenses and lost wages, but pain and suffering or punitive damages or anything else the employee himself might recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.242" offset="3027485">Then at that point the Secretary would take away from the recovery the amount that was necessary to compensate the... the fund for all the FICA benefits that had been paid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.612" offset="3072939">And only after that if there were some excess left over would that amount be paid to the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.359" offset="3100001">Now, that's... that's qualified by the one-fifth provision that came in in 1966, but really the principle behind it is that the... really the... the reimbursement of the compensation fund comes first under either 8131 or 8132.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.525" offset="3164681">Now, the court skipped over the language of the statute and moved directly to the legislative purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.735" offset="5933451">There were... in the Senate debates there were references to comparative negligence on several occasions, so they again recognized that that sort of principle might be at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.873" offset="5966052">But there was... there was no expression of concern about protecting those elements of damages like pain and suffering from this federal right to reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.276" offset="6007639">Now, there... there was some concern about protecting the damages from any credit against compensation for some future injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.304" offset="6043792">Congress said well, we don't... we don't want a sword of Damooles, is what they call it, hanging over the employee so that he would have to apply all of his recovery sometime in the future; but he didn't... he didn't know it... it would possibly happen to him some day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.000" offset="6106486">So they... they put in some language that said this right of reimbursement doesn't extend beyond that same injury; but there was no effort to... to protect any of these elements of damages from this... what appears to be an absolute right of recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.852" offset="6165941">Now, I'd just like to briefly mention another consideration we think underlies the statute, and that is, Congress' intent to create a... a uniform and manageable system that can be administered on a nationwide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.236" offset="6227485">We've pointed out in our brief the administrative difficulties we think the sort of test fashioned by the court of appeals would present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.360" offset="6259982">I don't think that Congress has indicated anywhere that... that it anticipated that the Secretary would be making this sort of state-by-state adjustment of federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.854" offset="6301987">And in the absence of that indication, I don't think it's appropriate to read it into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.368" offset="6319959">Now, the court of appeals thought it was significant that reimbursement was not necessary here in order to prevent double recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.287" offset="6359665">I don't dispute that... that Congress may have had this prevention of double recovery in mind as an effect of this reimbursement provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.454" offset="6396341">That was not the only purpose of the provision, and I don't... it was certainly not the decisive provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.389" offset="6424135">I think the point was to put the... the loss of the compensation benefits on the tort feasor, not on the compensation system, whenever it was possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.104" offset="6466976">If Congress had wanted to focus on this double recovery rationale, I think it could have drafted the statute in a much more limited manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.271" offset="6503652">Now, ultimately the court of appeals and Respondent fall back on their own conceptions of fairness to federal employees and on the... the ideas about parity between federal employees and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.141" offset="6563107">I think I've pointed out that in our view it is Pennsylvania that has come along and imposed upon the FICA system a different set of adjustments of rights and has created this sort of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.090" offset="6618904">It's within Pennsylvania's power to remedy this if they perceive it as unfair.</text>

            <text syncTime="1630.351" offset="6655894">But to the extent that Pennsylvania doesn't take care of this, I think that it is the burden of Congress to adjust any rights if it perceives that this is an unfair situation.</text>

I think that for him to go back to his own carrier now, I don't see how he could do it in these circumstances, because the carrier would also have the right to say we're entitled to get the benefit of workmen's compensation, and therefore, there is no no-fault liability, and the state court would turn around and say that's a correct interpretation of our statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.767" offset="9737611">It really comes down to, I think, the... the government... the federal government always would seem to be satisfied to accept state law in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.481" offset="9768436">It's not intending to define the circumstances under which a third party recovery may be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.229" offset="9795394">Pennsylvania theoretically could totally abolish third party recovery and say we're not going to allow any third party recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.132" offset="9823084">You're only right is to receive workmen's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.147" offset="9835100">The government would be out its compensation benefits, but under this statute it couldn't complain of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.130" offset="9851087">Now, that would be a different rule for one state than in another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.815" offset="9873761">But it seems that you're dealing with a state... a federal statute that is incorporating by state law... incorporating state law and should be bound by the rights that that state law creates for the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.701" offset="9921304">This is essentially a subrogation provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.761" offset="9929559">I do not accept the argument that there's some sort of separate right against the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.463" offset="9952338">8132 just is another element of interpreting the right of subrogation that is started 8131.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.117" offset="9982953">It says if the man makes recovery, he has to pay it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.474" offset="9992462">And I think that that would be the proper interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.598" offset="10004896">It treats all employees fairly and equally within the state and treats all federal employees equally as compared to the various states in which they are employed.</text>
