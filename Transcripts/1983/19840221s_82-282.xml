            <text syncTime="6.454" offset="129350">This case presents a question under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which has been amended several times since then. Edgefield County, South Carolina is a jurisdiction that's subject to the provisions of that statute and the statute requires that such a jurisdiction when it makes a change in election practices must submit the change either to the Attorney General of the United States or to a three-judge District Court here in the District of Columbia for approval before the change may become effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.442" offset="261216">Most frequently covered jurisdictions will follow the procedure of submission to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.215" offset="284308">In 1966, South Carolina adopted a statute that changed the practices in Edgefield County, but neither the State nor the county submitted the change for approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.788" offset="334672">In 1971 however, another statute was adopted and that statute was submitted and ultimately was approved by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.801" offset="370721">And in connection with the approval, the -- the earlier 1966 statute was called to the attention of the Attorney General and the question that arises is whether the 1971 approval embodied approval of the earlier statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.084" offset="427877">A three-judge District Court in South Carolina held that it was implicitly approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.935" offset="451179">We reverse that holding today because the submission to the Attorney General in 1971 did not call his attention of the fact that there had been a change in 1966 and the 1966 changed itself was never submitted for approval, so we reverse the judgment of the District Court for South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.090" offset="535815">The opinion -- I should say Justice Blackmun, Justice Powell and Justice Rehnquist have concurred in the judgment but not joined in the opinion which is otherwise unanimous.</text>
