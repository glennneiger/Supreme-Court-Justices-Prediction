            <text syncTime="99.663" offset="531760">That issue, as we define it, is, is the defendant constitutionally entitled to specific performance of a plea offer once made, then withdrawn, prior to entry of a guilty plea or a showing of detrimental reliance or prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.877" offset="828615">The facts below briefly are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.912" offset="840736">Fourteen years ago, in 1970, the defendant was charged with murder in the first degree, burglary, and assault with intent to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.934" offset="876785">He was convicted on the charge of murder and received life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.236" offset="894026">He was convicted on the charge of burglary and assault with intent to kill and received a sentence of 21 years and 12 years respectively, which were to be served concurrently.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.925" offset="932791">In 1972, the Arkansas Supreme Court reversed the murder conviction for inadequate jury instruction, and defendant was appointed a counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.983" offset="973020">He was arraigned, and a trial date was set.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.335" offset="982424">Late Friday afternoon, October 27th, 1972, the deputy prosecuting attorney communicated to the defense counsel a plea offer, that offer being, if the defendant would plead guilty to 21 years concurrent to the charge of accessory after felony murder, a plea could be stricken, a recommended plea could be agreed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.832" offset="1068419">Defense counsel took that offer to the defendant at the penitentiary the next day, and he agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.669" offset="1087750">The very next working day, Monday, October 30th, defense counsel communicated to the deputy prosecuting attorney his agreement, and was informed there was a mistake, that the plea recommendation would have to be for a sentence of 21 years consecutive rather than concurrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.614" offset="1159534">Defense counsel or defendant had no further comment to either the prosecutor or to the court until November the 8th of that year, when the defendant appeared before the court for trial on the charge of murder with a plea of not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.623" offset="1219616">That trial ended in mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.573" offset="1227348">A subsequent date was set.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.325" offset="1238424">It was continued, and the in February of 1973, the defendant, in the presence of a jury, withdrew his plea of guilty to the charge of murder in the first degree, entered voluntarily a plea of... excuse me, withdrew his plea of not guilty to murder in the first degree, entered a plea of guilty to the charge of accessory after felony murder, and was sentenced to 21 years consecutively.</text>

            <text syncTime="529.358" offset="2250512">It would have been as if the deputy prosecutor had said, would you accept a plea bargain in which we will drop all charges against your defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.297" offset="2282277">And so I think it is obvious from the logical conclusion that there was a mistake here, and that in this instance the defendant was not prejudiced by that mistake, because he did have an adequate remedy, which was trial by jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="578.189" offset="2445804">That is the issue that brings the state to this petition, for the reason that that erodes all discretion of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.295" offset="2474225">It is such a rigid, inflexible rule that there is no benefit, no mutuality of advantage that goes and flows to the state from plea bargaining for the very reason that you are bound only to the unilateral expectation of the defendant, and that there is some mutuality of advantage that is a part of the plea bargaining process that inures to the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.284" offset="2618212">Yes, Your Honor, it is still objectionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.570" offset="2623332">That obviously is a better remedy than what we have now, but it is still objectionable, because of the split in the circuits and the fact that predicated on this unilateral expectation of the defendant, and I think we find a situation where two disastrous results occur, the first of which is that we have given rise to a constitutional right to a defendant who has been engaged in the plea negotiation process, which this Court has enunciated that plea bargaining is not a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.018" offset="2721134">So, for those defendants that are not involved in the plea negotiation process, they don't have the same issue to bring to an appellate... for an appellate remedy of post-conviction remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.541" offset="2755198">Secondly, the effect of depending solely on the unilateral expectations of defendant can create a situation where literally each case on its merits will have to be reviewed through the post-conviction remedy and appellate process without being able to set a standard by which they can be judged against, because each defendant will have some expectation, I didn't believe that I was going to be sentenced to 21 years consecutive, and you get into this Court having to ask of events of five, ten, and fifteen years ago, what did one deputy prosecuting attorney say to one deputy public defender?</text>
            <text syncTime="688.678" offset="2887795">What was the context of the five to seven minute conversation?</text>
            <text syncTime="691.630" offset="2899603">What in fact happens if the defense counsel makes a mistake?</text>
            <text syncTime="694.849" offset="2912455">So it seems to me that the decision below was a very important decision in that it erodes the flexibility of fundamental fairness as it applies to the criminal justice system, and as I have said there would be no benefit that would have flown to the state if you follow the strict adherence of the court below, because Johnson would not be serving any time for the crime of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.330" offset="2994375">And although the court below says it does not rely on principles of contract, it does seem to adhere to some contracting theory in the sense that there is an offer and there was an acceptance, and therefore the state should be bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.255" offset="3054143">I submit to you that what we are discussing here are not issues of contract, and though the analogy may be important from the standpoint of being somewhat instructive, we are dealing with constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="760.525" offset="3175142">Yes, sir, I would make the same argument if you withdraw the plea if no prejudice had attached, there had been no detrimental reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.179" offset="3193846">I would also to this Court that as I said, that the result of this decision in terms of contract is one which this... we are talking about constitutional rights and the deprivation of liberty, and that if you were just going to analogize simply to contract, where one party negotiates with another, you realize that both parties have the power to enforce that agreement, and in this instance the criminal defendant has the right to withdraw that plea, even though there has been a bargain struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.763" offset="3304083">The offense to the dignity of the state in terms of prosecution and the very narrow rigid rule applied by the Eighth Circuit is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.638" offset="3343580">Take this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.671" offset="3351730">Had the prosecutor offered 20 years, 25 years, to be specific, and the defender had heard only five and communicated that five-year offer to his defendant, he would have said, I accept, would have communicated back to the prosecuting attorney, we accept the plea of five years, but in fact it should have been communicated to the one who originally made the offer, who was out sick, to a second one, and they agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.836" offset="3440442">And then the prosecution went forward to take a statement from the defendant showing some reliance on his part in which he perhaps implicated other accessories to this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.609" offset="3475551">Then in fact only at the time that we appeared before the bar of justice of the court at the trial court level would we find the situation where the defendant could have raised the issue of he had unilaterally expected a five-year sentence instead of a 25-year sentence, and his expectation was predicated on the argument of his defense counsel, the mistake there, and that if you follow the rule of the Eighth Circuit below and its rigid application, you could contend that that bargain must be struck, and in fact that defendant is entitled to that when the mistake was not made by the government whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.128" offset="3597595">The argument also has been made that the government must act scrupulously.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.180" offset="3613791">If you can't trust the government, who can you trust?</text>
            <text syncTime="872.965" offset="3624971">Well, in fact, the better policy, of course, is that in any plea bargaining situation between the prosecution and the defense, every offer and agreement should be made, but the fact also is that we do not deal with technical precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.892" offset="3684635">People do make mistakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.093" offset="3693412">And the trust of the defendant is not based really in the prosecutor, because the prosecutor is the defendant's advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.647" offset="3719639">The trust of the defendant is predicated in his belief in the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.301" offset="3738238">And so therefore the decision below does not fashion an adequate remedy in the sense of mutuality of advantage that it could gain through the plea bargaining process, because the court needs the discretion to review these plea bargaining negotiations and then order, one, specific performance or, two, recision, which gives that defendant an adequate remedy, which is trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.833" offset="3828413">Excuse me, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.253" offset="3858088">I think it is important from the perspective of the state to indicate that unless we have a standard enunciated by this Court, a standard which indicates that without some showing of bad faith, without some showing of detrimental reliance, that we have an unworkable triple justice system in which the state must function, because virtually in the calendar year 1983 just in the United States District Courts alone there were some 35,000 defendants who plead guilty or nolo to criminal charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.792" offset="3988282">Of that number, some 29,000... excuse me, were charged with criminal offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.611" offset="4007508">Of that number, some 29,000 either pled guilty or in fact pled nolo.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.413" offset="4026734">So you have 30,000 out of 35,000 coming into the system by virtue of plea bargaining and the negotiation process, and a mutuality of advantage must flow to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.288" offset="4066231">It must flow to the state or the state finds itself continually in litigation as to the expectation of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.442" offset="4090891">The remedy that the state would beseech this Court and urge this Court to give is that standard, the showing of bad faith, the showing of some detrimental reliance, and that that is not just mistake, because mistake is not enough in that if you follow just mistake there is no punishment, for instance, in this case at bar, that would flow to the defendant, and no respect for the dignity of the people of the state of Arkansas for an offense committed against its dignity and its citizenry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.346" offset="4222444">I would conclude, Your Honor, by simply saying this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.584" offset="4251387">Fundamental fairness and mutuality of advantage of plea bargaining require that a punishment must fit the crime, that the state must have the ability to deal equally and dispose of cases quickly, and deal equally with the defendant in the plea bargaining process, and that to protect the rights of the citizenry of our state, the defendant is not entitled to any specific performance of a plea bargain made and then withdrawn unless that defendant has in fact demonstrated that there has been some detrimental reliance or some prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.455" offset="4378865">If there are no further questions of the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1079.667" offset="4451799">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.417" offset="4462770">In our view, the Court of Appeals incorrectly magnified the respondent's unilateral expectations into a constitutional... a protected constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.075" offset="4501431">Since the federal courts, of course, have no general supervisory power over the state courts in criminal cases, the role of this Court in a habeas proceeding is limited to correcting constitutional violations, and it is our submission that such questions arise only when the defendant's reliance on a plea agreement substantially induces his waiver of a right protected by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.173" offset="4601742">Ordinarily such an issue will not arise until a defendant pleads guilty, but if the prosecutor breaches his bargain after that, Santobello teaches that a remedy may be appropriate, that the defendant would be entitled to relief, and the reason is that where the bargain is a material inducement to the plea, the knowing and voluntary nature of the plea is called into question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.972" offset="4701007">Now, admittedly, there may be some cases where similar concerns would arise prior to the plea, where the defendant has detrimentally relied on the bargain, for example, by cooperating with ongoing investigation, but the same principle applies here, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.714" offset="4763910">The defendant would be entitled to some kind of relief only because his reliance on the agreement undermines the knowing and voluntary waiver of a protected constitutional right, and that is the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1672.432" offset="6822777">Now, under the rule of the Court of Appeals, what prosecutors are going to have to do to protect themselves is that they are going to have to possibly conduct all negotiations on the record, and as a result, they would remove much of the flexibility that now benefits defendants as well as the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.125" offset="6885575">Another possibility is that plea proposals may be couched with so many contingencies that they are virtually meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.298" offset="6918280">Another possibility is that negotiations will be delayed until so late in the process that the benefits of prompt disposition would be lost to prosecutors and defendants, because, after all, in Arkansas and presumably in the Eighth Circuit, the prosecutor is going to be concerned that a slip of the tongue may bind him to something that he never intended to say, and that the other side never took him... and relied on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2048.891" offset="8328684">Mr. Quiggle, under Arkansas practice, if the agreement had been... there had been no misunderstanding and no change, and had been submitted to the court, would there have been a recommendation by the prosecutor that that be entered?</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_quiggle" startTime="2061.949" stopTime="2272.469">
            <label>Mr. Richard Quiggle</label>
            <text syncTime="2061.949" offset="8380824">Absolutely, Your Honor, and the fact of the matter is, even unto this day trial courts in Arkansas routinely, if not... and consistently take those recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.006" offset="8425128">It is rare that a court rejects one in Arkansas, and that was certainly true back when the plea would have been entered in this case had the government not reneged on its word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.647" offset="8471626">Unfortunately, the trial judge who would have heard this matter has been dead a number of years, so it would be impossible to go back to him, and the practice has shifted some.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.020" offset="8513108">We have new rules of criminal procedure, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.324" offset="8526378">But practically speaking, had this gone before the trial judge, every expectation would have been that it would have been approved if a prosecutor recommended it, and that is, of course, a central point to what my position is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.065" offset="8585311">I am certainly not suggesting in the routine course of things that trial judges would be bound by what the prosecutor agrees to recommend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.403" offset="8618643">On the contrary, it is simply that the prosecutor has to stick by his word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.324" offset="8642362">The trial court can always reject it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.693" offset="8651871">And I don't perceive the Eighth Circuit... that's why I continue to make the point that I don't think this is a proper case for any kind of broad ruling, because it has got some screwy facts in it, and there is also the aspect of this case that I think makes it difficult... my position difficult here is that there is ineffectiveness proven in the record, and there is ineffectiveness claimed as to the trial counsel for not going forward to enforce the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.260" offset="8762107">He states in the hearing that there was simply nothing he could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.128" offset="8777572">Now, I presume that a deputy prosecuting attorney knows the law, and Santobello had been decided several months at that point, but those issues were not reached by the Eighth Circuit, so I don't mean to rely on or press it on this Court heavily at this time, but the fact is, there is a lot of uncertainty built into this opinion, I believe, and therefore I don't think it's the kind of a case upon which a broad ruling should depend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.113" offset="8881539">If there is one, I just think it is that the prosecutor cannot make his word in a final sense, as here, where there was an offer that was clear on its face, and I disagree with the state when they say that it is really simple, it is really logical to figure out what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.859" offset="8964504">If that is true, why didn't they put on any proof about that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.828" offset="8976416">They offered no witnesses at all in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.363" offset="8990522">None.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.147" offset="8993657">The fact is, if one wants to speculate, which is all the state can do, about the prosecutor's motivations, I submit to you that it is equally logical and perhaps a lot more believable that this prosecutor meant exactly what he said when he offered 21 years concurrent, and the supervisor found out about it and overruled him, because the facts of this case, as are clearly seen from the Eighth Circuit's opinion, were shocking, where a father kills his own daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.418" offset="9122702">There was lots of press.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.603" offset="9127508">The Court will recall there was a mistrial because of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.222" offset="9141928">After the plea was rejected there were collateral civil lawsuits filed in this matter, and I think the prosecutor was taking a lot of heat, and consequently he said no, we can't... we are going to have to get more time out of this guy, the deputy prosecutor's superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.017" offset="9213190">And I think under the facts--</text>

            <text syncTime="2275.838" offset="9236387">--Your Honor, I don't think it was for some months, until after the plea was rejected, because it was set down for a hearing that was continued, and then they came back and had the mistrial that I mentioned just a second ago, and I believe that it was not until they commenced that trial that my client, Mr. Johnson, knew that the original offer had been rejected.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard Quiggle</label>
            <text syncTime="2313.963" offset="9388942">It is not clear from the record, Your Honor, but I will say that the prosecutor, the deputy prosecutor who was assigned to the case after the plea was withdrawn by the state admitted that he did not contact Mr. Johnson until shortly before the time of the hearing where the mistrial occurred, and so I think presumably that encompasses the fact that he did not communicate the withdrawn plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.665" offset="9503776">The facts are very specific about how the original offer was made, and I think that they would have been equally specific had this been communicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.921" offset="9540765">I think if the Court does consider this matter in the broad sense that the state seeks, that it must give due consideration to the state's argument that the Sixth Amendment does not apply in situations like this, because I think clearly it does apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.703" offset="9635851">I think that, for example, as a trial counsel in a criminal matter, if my client has admitted that he is guilty, and is ready to plead, I believe that that is going to have a profound impact upon that defendant if he then is forced to go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.367" offset="9714532">It is certainly going to have a profound impact on me or any other criminal attorney if I have to put that man on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.305" offset="9750267">I think it would be very difficult to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.924" offset="9764791">I think it places counsel in a very awkward ethical position, because probably he is going to have to take the stand and lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.946" offset="9804915">Therefore, I think that the Court must be very cautious in waving aside the state's argument that... or my contention that the Sixth Amendment is very important in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.325" offset="9870431">The Eighth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit in the Cooper case certainly thought it was also.</text>

            <text syncTime="2492.780" offset="10104174">I would just like to say one more thing, and that is that I don't see the Eighth Circuit establishing a prophylactic rule here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.132" offset="10233637">I think the Eighth Circuit's decision was tailored only to the facts of this particular case, and it was very narrowly drawn, and therefore I don't believe that it impinges upon the criminal process in the way that the state perceives, but if it does, it should impinge such that the prosecution must deal honestly and fairly and abide by its word.</text>
