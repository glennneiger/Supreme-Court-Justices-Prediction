            <label>Mr. Mark V. Meierhenry</label>
            <text syncTime="8.407" offset="182245">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.158" offset="189246">This case comes to the Court from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.861" offset="208054">The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, under the case of Edward versus Arizona, in a case collaterally attacking the conviction of Mr. Stumes, reversed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.210" offset="261448">The question presented to this Court is whether Edward versus Arizona will be applied retroactively to the case of Mr. Stumes when that attack was made by a habeas corpus relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.387" offset="314216">The facts essentially on this case is in 1973 Norman Stumes killed a young lady in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.745" offset="347653">This occurred on September 17, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.385" offset="362177">Ten days later he was arrested in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on other charges that had been pending, not on what were originally filed as murder charges, but on perjury charges and other charges at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.944" offset="416407">During the time that the authorities were seeking him for questioning concerning the death of Miss Hoff, his mother hired an attorney for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.781" offset="459770">And, his attorney had a conversation with the law enforcement officers in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and that lawyer advised the law enforcement officers that if he got a hold of Mr. Stumes first, he would tell him to turn himself in for questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.402" offset="514209">On the other hand, if the authorities found him first and arrested him first, that they would not question him until the attorney, Mr. Jorgensen, was notified, and that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.329" offset="557991">Mr. Jorgensen was notified some time on the 27th of October 1973... or the 27th of September 1973 that Mr. Stumes had been arrested over in Green Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.615" offset="611071">Mr. Jorgensen then, either on the 28th or the 29th of September in 1973, called Norman Stumes and told him not to talk to anybody until he was brought back to South Dakota, to exercise his right to speak with no one.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.866" offset="672093">Upon being arrested by the Green Bay authorities, he was given his Miranda rights which were required in 1973 and he made no statements at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.652" offset="707306">Later on two police officers, as well as a deputy sheriff from South Dakota, went to Green Bay to transport him back and they arrived there on October 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.320" offset="749938">They met with Mr. Stumes in Wisconsin, Brown County, Wisconsin jail at which time Mr. Stumes gave them voluntary permission to search where he had been arrested, the place where he had been arrested and his automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.448" offset="810438">He was also given Miranda warnings at that time by the South Dakota authorities and a conversation ensued for about an hour and 45 minutes of which nothing incriminating came out of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.337" offset="854010">Later that afternoon there was another conversation between the Defendant and the authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.001" offset="876684">He was not given his Miranda rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.550" offset="882849">The record is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.882" offset="888178">And, the only, as found by the District Court, the only true incriminating thing is that he admitted that he had intercourse with the dead girl on the day in question and he also, in answer to a question posed to him, was this death accidental, he answered that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.263" offset="957664">Of course, he was going to be brought back to South Dakota on these other charges, not the murder charges, and so on October 2nd, they proceeded to get an in automobile and drive the 500 miles from Green Bay, Wisconsin, back to Sioux Falls, South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.564" offset="1018895">When they got in the car, he was once again given his Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.436" offset="1038435">And, a conversation about the case, about the murder part of the case, took place for 20 or 30 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.661" offset="1067274">They left about 9:00 in the morning from Green Bay, drove in a westerly direction towards Sioux Falls, South Dakota, arrived back in Sioux Falls, South Dakota about 6:45 in the evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.469" offset="1114503">But, about 90 miles from Sioux Falls, Norman Stumes, and I will take his words, said... Norman Stumes, in testifying at various hearings, said,</text>
            <text syncTime="251.875" offset="1156195">"I had a little conflict with my emotions. "</text>
            <text syncTime="254.547" offset="1166853">and he began to sob and he made the statement to the effect, I don't understand why anybody would want to kill a young girl like Joyce.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.093" offset="1201021">And, Detective Green, an officer of the State of South Dakota, said, Norman, it probably... Why don't you get it off your chest, at which time he made admissions that implicated him and were used against him at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.862" offset="1256087">And, Stumes also said at that time, according to Detective Green, that I have been wanting to tell somebody about this but I didn't know how to do it or who to talk to.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.539" offset="1298823">This conversation took place approximately 90 miles from Sioux Falls, and although the record is not clear, about 5:00 in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.216" offset="1337484">Throughout that time, from 9:00 to 9:30, throughout the day, Norman Stumes himself says he was not interrogated, that there was general conversation about the Green Bay Packers, automobile racing, and other such things.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.934" offset="1400387">Just prior to his starting to sob and make these statements... he describes the situation, the Defendant does, like this: That there had been no conversation in the car for 10 or 15 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.816" offset="1463917">Officer Skadsen, who was sitting in the front seat of this automobile, was almost alseep, he was nodding off.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.761" offset="1491711">The other gentleman was driving.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.331" offset="1497981">Detective Green was looking out of the window somewhat bored.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.474" offset="1510520">That is when he had his conflict with his emotions, began with the statement, why would anyone want to kill Joyce, began to sob.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.741" offset="1551584">The officer said, Norman, get it off your chest, at which time he made the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.322" offset="1569974">Once they returned back to South Dakota, he was placed in the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.345" offset="1590036">The officers broke off all contact with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.528" offset="1602784">They went to another part.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.100" offset="1609053">He sent word out through a jailer, called Detective Skadsen back into the jail area, and said to Officer Skadsen, please tell them that I am not a vicious killer, that I didn't mean to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.580" offset="1674986">The Eighth Circuit held Edwards to be retroactive and held that in--</text>

            <text syncTime="497.577" offset="2138921">First of all, this Court will should agree, I guess you would say, to apply the retroactive effect.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark V. Meierhenry</label>
            <text syncTime="505.040" offset="2168805">I don't think we get to that unless this Court decides to apply Edwards retroactively, which, of course, we would say this is like Miranda and the many other cases this Court has not applied retroactively, shouldn't be applied retroactively, because the Court has indicated to those of us whose duty it is to educate the law enforcement officers... At least in my state it falls upon the Attorney General, and when this Court makes a rule like Edwards, a new rule, one that we were not used to, certain things go into operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.402" offset="2302239">As the Attorney General, my duty is to train all the law enforcement officers as well as to supervise prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.278" offset="2329720">So, when this Court... Within days after this Court makes a new rule like Edwards, we immediately send out in police parlance, you might say, what can occur and what cannot occur throughout our state and that is done on almost an emergency basis, because there is no reason to start a case and not follow the proper procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.591" offset="2419058">So, with that in mind, we have to decide whether this case should be retroactively applied as the Eighth Circuit did, and, of course, as indicated in the Palteire case, this is not an appropriate type of case for retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.253" offset="2481648">It does not assist in any way the truth-finding portion of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.926" offset="2504322">As a matter of fact, if we follow what the Eighth Circuit has said, and we go back and retry Norman Stumes, the truthful statements that he made to law enforcement officers will be suppressed by the exclusionary rule, whereas, those matters found to be untruthful, his version of what happened that day, and his attempt, testifying under oath before a jury to escape the culpability that he had admitted to prior, will be allowed in.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.376" offset="2626157">In other words, we will have decided a case, apply the exclusionary rule retroactively, take the truth out of the case, and leave the Defendant--</text>

            <text syncTime="627.822" offset="2659907">But, if he takes the stand and testifies the way he did, wouldn't some of the statements that might be excluded initially under Miranda and Edwards be admissible on cross examination?</text>

            <text syncTime="1230.617" offset="5071114">If you go back through the records of state court trials in South Dakota, you will find people that are simply witnesses, police officers given the Miranda warnings because they don't want to make a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.874" offset="5116149">They don't want to go too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.975" offset="5124508">They don't want to arrest a person, convict them, and then at a later date have him let go on appeal because of their mistake, because they didn't give a Miranda warning when they should, because they didn't figure out who initiated it, which is the new Edwards rule, which, to us, is absolutely new, not an extension of Miranda, adds an element of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.060" offset="5216877">If we are to sustain a conviction, we must prove that if he confesses as Stumes did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.296" offset="5245821">There is no question about this man's guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.035" offset="5252822">It is a question of procedure of retroactive application of a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.909" offset="5276332">And, when a case like Edwards comes down, I have learned as Attorney General, we must immediately put it into effect, otherwise we will be right back here or my predecessor will, eight or ten years, not arguing about the guilt, not arguing about the trial being fair, arguing about who initiated the statements that lead to the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.145" offset="5373194">We think that this case is just like... not just like, very similar to Oregon versus Bradshaw in the sense that in that case a majority of this Court held that first we have to see who initiated the conversation and then, secondly, we have to show by a totality of the circumstances that it was a willing and knowing waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.192" offset="5469429">In this case, the Defendant himself says I wasn't being interrogated, there was just some conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.866" offset="5500149">Then he said, and this was immediately... during the conversation that is so crucial, he said I had to tell somebody, I had to get it out, and I wanted to talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.095" offset="5545080">And, I see nothing in the Constitution that prevents an individual from confessing to a law enforcement officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.510" offset="5578725">That is what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.840" offset="5584054">And, as the law was at that time, under Miranda... Judge Nichol ruled under Miranda all of this was proper, all of this was admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.536" offset="5622820">The only thing that the Eighth Circuit, and I think it is important to note the times, Judge Nichol refers to the oral argument reported in Law Week of the Edwards case, but it was decided after Judge Nichol made his ruling at the District Court level and obviously the Eighth Circuit used it in making their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.298" offset="5701814">But, the Eighth Circuit, in applying the retroactivity, never had a discussion of how in this case it would ever help the truth-finding process to make it retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.460" offset="5758448">Miranda itself was not retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.491" offset="5766598">How does it help the truth-finding process to eliminate truthful statements from the trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.896" offset="5800244">It is the same argument we made to this Court, South Dakota did in Nebel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.529" offset="5814768">How does it ever help the truth-finding process to retroactively exclude the truth?</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.095" offset="5849040">Now, if we... I will assume for my argument that we agree with the exclusionary rule as authority in South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.648" offset="5879238">Once the rule of Edwards came into effect May 18, 1981, of course, we must scrupulously follow it, as we followed Miranda in 1973 in Mr. Stumes' case, because if we have the right person, if the jury finds him guilty, we want it to be upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="1793.007" offset="7320675">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.498" offset="7338647">I would like to start out, first of all, spending a few minutes going over the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.201" offset="7361426">I think that in some respects the facts have not been stated as I would like to have them stated at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.229" offset="7401550">I think it is important to bear in mind that while this case originated in 1973, the Miranda decision of this Court was, of course, handed down seven years, a full seven years prior to the facts that give rise to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.842" offset="7476051">And, I think that we need to bear in mind that while the ten years and two months that Mr. Stumes has been in prison is a long time, the 17 years since Miranda is even longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.132" offset="7545223">We have a situation in this case where on September 17, 1973, the body of the victim is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.708" offset="7587437">My client, Norman Stumes, is located in Green Bay, Wisconsin, ten days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.954" offset="7616485">So, it is not a situation where a suspect is found immediately following an alleged crime and immediately confesses, thereby making further independent investigation by the authorities seem pointless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.474" offset="7682523">There was a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.377" offset="7690151">The fact of the matter is that by the time these detectives got to Green Bay to question and transport Norm Stumes, they already knew they had a murder case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.115" offset="7745112">They had a pathologist who indicated that the cause of death and the other circumstances of death were such as to make it a homicide case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1953.481" offset="7962555">They attempted to take, I believe, fingerprints.</text>

            <text syncTime="1960.656" offset="7991290">So they did a lot of things to attempt to establish their case and to put their case together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.390" offset="8014173">My point then was that by the time they went to Green Bay they had a prime suspect and that appears in the record, I believe, quite clearly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3535.321" offset="14289935">It seems to me that if we view Edwards as establishing a new principle, then it seems to me it was abundantly foreshadowed by Miranda, because Miranda said when they ask for counsel you quit questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.103" offset="14365063">And, I think all Edwards did was reinforce that, give life to it, give vitality to it, and tell the authorities that you will abide, you will abide by that request.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.621" offset="14419084">So, that is the way I view it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.974" offset="14428593">By way of conclusion, we do respectfully request on behalf of our client that the judgment of the Eighth Circuit in this matter be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3593.059" offset="14520857">As most courts are wont to do, most of the argument today had to do with how to apply Edwards retroactively and, of course, it is our strenuous objection, and I only rise to remind the Court that under the prior rules and teachings of this Court this is not an appropriate case to apply retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.383" offset="14606226">And, if it is not a proper case and you agree with the state, then obviously the Eighth Circuit must be reversed because it most certainly was proper under Miranda and any other case until the new Edwards rule was adopted in 1981.</text>
