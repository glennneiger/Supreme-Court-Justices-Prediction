            <label>Mr. Warren M. Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="23.081" offset="239410">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.236" offset="252054">The fundamental issue before you is whether California obtained from the United States a public trust property interest in Mexican rancho lands which are now held by private parties under an unqualified federal patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.246" offset="328122">By a divided vote, the California Supreme Court held that upon its admission to the union, California obtained a public trust property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.226" offset="375979">The California Supreme Court recognized that never before in more than 130 years since California entered the union had this public trust concept been extended to Mexican rancho lands, or indeed to any other lands to which California had never previously had title.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.075" offset="463437">The theory of the California Supreme Court was that Mexico retained a public trust interest when it conveyed this land into private ownership in 1839, that the United States acquired this interest when it annexed California in 1848, and that California succeeded to the interest under the equal footing doctrine when it entered the union in 1850.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.517" offset="585167">Now, this public trust interest carved cut by California is a permanent and pervasive estate in land.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.387" offset="624664">For example, it is so pervasive that the state can enter upon and possess the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.493" offset="653086">It enables the state to construct improvements on the property or, on the other hand, to require that the property be held as open space without compensation.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="138.660" offset="701778">Mr. Christopher, is that a holding or a statement of the California Supreme Court that you are quoting from or one of the California appellate courts?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_m_christopher" startTime="147.627" stopTime="384.313">
            <label>Mr. Warren M. Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="147.627" offset="737618">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is the holding of a line of California cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.966" offset="758934">Marx v.... the Marx case cited in my brief is the principal and most recent case.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.480" offset="780981">It begins with the California Fish case in 1913, and it has marched through a long series of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.024" offset="815149">The public trust interest which has been marked out by the California Supreme Court is independent of any exercise of police power, and it based not on the present condition of the property, but upon its historical character when California entered the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.124" offset="907623">Thus this property interest is permanent and continues to exist even where the property has been lawfully filled and reclaimed by its owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.778" offset="950255">Now, as the Court knows, it was settled in early cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.570" offset="981393">One of the foundation cases, Knight versus United States Land Association, settled that California did not get ownership of tidelands within Mexican land grants or ranchos when it entered the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.847" offset="1034473">The reason for this special treatment of rancho properties or Mexican grant properties was the international duty of the United States under the 1848 Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.449" offset="1104899">The rule of these cases is not directly challenged here, but it is indirectly subverted through the carving out of this very extensive public trust property interest in rancho lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.381" offset="1164668">The question before the Court is whether the Court will permit and authorize the erosion of private rights by denying the owner the most fundamental aspects of ownership under the California Supreme Court public trust doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.153" offset="1231750">In a fundamental sense, this case turns on the meaning of the Act of March 3, 1851, which is known as the Mexican Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.117" offset="1287548">This Act was the mechanism to carry out the commitment of the United States under the Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo, which of course as you know ended the war between the United States and Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.613" offset="1341569">To heal the wounds of that war, the United States made a commitment that the property rights of former Mexican citizens would be inviolably respected, inviolably respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.481" offset="1401024">The title to the 1851 Act sends an important message.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.230" offset="1424011">The title is An Act to Ascertain and Settle Private land Claims in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.445" offset="1448880">Thus the purpose of the Act was to determine once and for all the validity and scope of land claims in California, to issue patents to those that proved their claims, and to identify the remainder as public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.907" offset="1510738">It was a jurisdiction, as this Court has said, to decide rightly or wrongly, and whatever decided is now foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.106" offset="1547518">This is the line of cases O'Donnell in 303 U.S., earlier Title Insurance, and Thompson Land Company, all cited in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.166" offset="1587747">The crucial point is that between the claimants and the United States the 1851 Act proceedings were tantamount to a quiet title action.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.692" offset="1637902">Decisions in favor of the claimants are conclusive against the United States, and anyone claiming under the United States, as California is here.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="384.313" offset="1684295">Mr. Christopher, may I interrupt you and ask you one question?</text>
            <text syncTime="387.981" offset="1699028">I understand that you don't in your brief argue the point that the government does in the first point of their brief about what happened with the actual original conveyance.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.383" offset="1736645">If you assume that the trust was reserved in the original conveyance, contrary to the government's position, what is your view as to the status of the title to the trust interest the day after California was admitted to the union and before the 1851 Act was passed?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_m_christopher" startTime="416.346" stopTime="488.129">
            <label>Mr. Warren M. Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="416.346" offset="1812504">Well, my view of that is that at that time, that issue was an unsettled issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.418" offset="1864749">I will take your assumption for the moment, Mr. Justice Stevens, that such a right did exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.928" offset="1894842">It was within the power of the Board of Land Commissioners under the 1851 Act to determine questions exactly like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.958" offset="1934966">The Board of Land Commissioners was set up to separate the public domain from private property, and in accordance with that jurisdiction, the Board of Land Commissioners passed on such questions as whether or not there was such a right under Mexican law.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.811" offset="2002362">Indeed, the land commissioners were specifically chosen for their knowledge of Mexican law.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.493" offset="2025037">So, until the Act of 1851 exercised its power to determine these rights, that question was an uncertain question, but it was well within the power of the Board of Land Commissioners under the 1851 Act to resolve exactly that kind of a question.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="488.129" offset="2099642">I don't think that answers my question, Mr. Christopher.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.797" offset="2118242">I am assuming that before it was answered, that the correct answer would have been that it was something other than what happened in 1851.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.044" offset="2159306">You are saying that the activity pursuant to the 1851 statute conveyed that interest regardless of what its status was before, as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.681" offset="2193788">You say that even though that would have enlarged the rights of your clients.</text>

            <text syncTime="518.147" offset="2219701">Mr. Justice Stevens, on your question, I would say that after California entered the union, and before the 1851 Act proceedings, and taking your assumption that such a right did exist--</text>

            <label>Mr. Warren M. Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="536.171" offset="2291799">--then that right may have passed to California under the equal footing clause, although there is a subsidiary question there, and that is whether or not the equal footing clause covered such partial rights, a question also addressed in the brief.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="550.540" offset="2349268">Mr. Christopher, I am interested in just how this is a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.522" offset="2373197">Supposing this happened, that your client had a confirmed patent from the Mexican land grant that had been authorized by the Claims Commission, and so forth, and adjoining your client's property was another property which didn't come under the Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo, and there was just a classic surveying dispute, say, as to 20 feet of their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.278" offset="2476224">The Mexican patent showed that your client owned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.387" offset="2488658">The deed under the authority of the state of California showed that the other people owned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.649" offset="2505690">And that is litigated in the California courts, and the California Supreme Court applies its rule as to how you solve these surveying ambiguity disputes, and rules against your client, saying that the Mexican patent description doesn't prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.145" offset="2567652">Do you think your client could come here on the grounds that it is a federal question because the full latitude of the description in the confirmed Mexican patent wasn't confirmed by the Supreme Court of California?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_m_christopher" startTime="617.124" stopTime="698.215">
            <label>Mr. Warren M. Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="617.124" offset="2615613">I think that is a much different case than the case here, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.857" offset="2638496">The clearest cut federal question before this Court is whether the state of California received anything pursuant to the equal footing clause when California entered the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.115" offset="2691577">The California Supreme Court deliberately put this decision on the basis of the fact that title... I'm sorry, this property interest passed from Mexico to the United States, and then from the United States to California under the equal footing clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.250" offset="2752077">One of the things that is clearest under this Court's decisions is that what a state initially receives under the equal footing clause is a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.854" offset="2798470">The decision of this Court in what I call the Humboldt Light Case, California Land Commission, Justice White's opinion in a footnote, I think, says specifically that what a state received initially under the equal footing clause is a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.754" offset="2866075">Now, there are other possible federal questions, but I think there can be no doubt at all as to whether that is a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.982" offset="2898989">Other possible federal questions relate to the Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo and the construction of the 1851 Act, but on that question I think there is no doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="703.682" offset="2961788">Mr. Chief Justice, the treaty is the background for the 1851 Act, and the 1851 Act is the crucial basis for decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.425" offset="3012779">The 1851 Act provides that the Board of Land Commissioners' ruling is conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.332" offset="3040468">The treaty questions are only important background for both the 1851 Act and for this Court's ruling in earlier cases that Mexican ranchos are in a special category, and that the state does not receive tidelands in Mexican ranchos when it entered the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="772.200" offset="3235864">If you prevail here, are we not constructing, what shall I call it, a Mason-Dixon line between... in the southern part of California with these old Mexican grants, and in the northern part where there are no Mexican grants, with different rules of law flowing from each?</text>

            <text syncTime="798.455" offset="3340877">Mr. Justice Blackmun, I know the California Supreme Court took that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.094" offset="3371492">The land titles in California vary all up and down the coast with respect to those tidelands that the state owns because they received them under the equal footing clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.510" offset="3421125">Many of those have been granted into private ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.650" offset="3433664">Many of them are held in public ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.008" offset="3447143">So there are many categories of tidelands or shorelands in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.834" offset="3470444">I think that is a much overstated worry on the part of the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.690" offset="3493850">Frankly, there is a checkerboarding of title all up and down the coast, and the fact that it has been settled for 130 years that Mexican land grants are in a special category, I think, would indicate that it would land stability rather than promote instability for the Court to vindicate my position here today.</text>

            <text syncTime="935.071" offset="3887358">There has been, as I said, for a century or more special rules with respect to Mexican rancho lands, and this case can be decided solely on those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.317" offset="3932393">The California public trust doctrine could stand with respect to other property, and you could decide in this case that because of this long course of decision beginning with Knight versus... beginning with the Knight case, that Mexican rancho lands are in a special category because of the treaty duty, because of the international duties of the United States under the Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.229" offset="4028002">Let me just say that there is no question in this case of the full compliance of the owners of the rancho here, Rancho La Ballona, with all the administrative and statutory procedures set up under the Mexican Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.752" offset="4118072">The end of that procedure was the granting of an unqualified patent under the statute itself and under decisions of this Court like the United States versus O'Donnell in 303 U.S. That patent is conclusive against the United States and against all those claiming under the United States, such as the state of California.</text>

            <text syncTime="1025.442" offset="4248893">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.877" offset="4262581">One could, of course, debate the wisdom, indeed, even the correctness of the rule exempting Mexican land grants from the equal footing principle that the state is the owner of at least navigable water bottoms and tidal lands, but on this question, the law has been settled so well so long ago that to engage in such an exercise today with respect to a rule of property would seem out of bounds and out of date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.828" offset="4414405">On the other hand, the state ought not be permitted to attempt to circumvent that settled, established law by conceding the bare title to these tidelands to the landowner while claiming to have reserved for itself all the uses and full control of those water bottoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.131" offset="4515655">But in our view, this is uniquely a case ruled by authority, indeed, by two decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.300" offset="4560273">Those are, in our view, the Coronado Beach case, reported in Volume 255 of this Court's decision, and the Title Insurance Company case, reported ten volumes later at 265 U.S., both cases cited in all briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.666" offset="4653791">Those are two unanimous decisions, the first one by Mr. Justice Holmes, the second by Mr. Justice Van de Vanter, bringing, as this Court has remarked in later days, the authority of an expert in the field of land law and Indian law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.783" offset="4734248">Those two decisions represent the culmination of a long line of cases stretching back more than 50 years in which the Court had addressed the several problems relating to Mexican land grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.369" offset="4808540">For the most part, the decisions in 1921 and 1923 merely reaffirmed what was already well settled, but they did more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.987" offset="4859009">They put to rest any doubts, any ambiguities, any unresolved questions that still lingered at this date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.017" offset="4899133">As it happens in both these cases, the United States was then advancing, in the early 1920's, arguments very like those advanced by California today, but we lost, and that was more than 60 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.523" offset="4981157">Even then, the Court chided the government with attempting to unsettle rules of property on which substantial reliance had been placed in the interim, and which in the Court's words</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.094" offset="5047508">"to now disturb would be fraught with many injurious results. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.217" offset="5067988">Now, obviously, that is all the more true now, 60 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.058" offset="5091290">Touching those cases briefly, the first one, the Coronado Beach Company case, that was a case in which the United States brought a condemnation action with respect to an island in San Diego Bay which was the subject... which had been the subject of a Mexican grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.174" offset="5175822">The question was whether the grant of the island embraced some 600 acres of water bottoms on one side, both submerged and tidelands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.621" offset="5225559">We then in 1921 elaborately argued that the tidelands could not have passed to the grantee because under the equal footing doctrine they had been reserved to the state; furthermore, that Mexican law would not have included such water bottoms; and finally, that the Land Commission, which had seemingly adjudicated the water bottoms as part of the grant, had no jurisdiction to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.095" offset="5351469">Those arguments, as I say, elaborately put to the Court, were rejected in three sentences by Justice Holmes, and from that day that question has no longer been thought open, but interestingly, the United States made an alternative argument in that case, and it was that even if bare title had passed to the Mexican grantee, the United States did not... was not required to pay full value for these water bottoms in this condemnation action because there were reserved public rights both in the United States and in the state of California that so diminished the value of these water bottoms that the very inflated price ought not be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.665" offset="5585735">We claimed, among other things, the California public trust, citing the California Fish case as an indication that the grantee had never received these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.254" offset="5636099">Now, once again, the Court rejected these arguments firmly and affirmed the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.453" offset="5668909">That ought to have been the end of the proposition that any such pervasive easement attached to Mexican grants in the absence of any words to that effect, and incidentally, in that case, the words about enclosing without prejudice to crossings, roads, and servitudes were included in the grant and were pleaded by the United States just as they are in this grant pleaded by California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.499" offset="5805059">But the Court has put those aside.</text>

            <text syncTime="1417.031" offset="5815195">Mr. Claiborne, is it possible that that holding could rest on the notion that the trust did not in fact change the value of the lands as opposed to a holding that there was no such trust interest.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="1425.637" offset="5849677">The Court adverts, Mr. Justice Stevens, only to one of the claims, which was a claim of a right in the government to use the property for national defense, and the Court firmly rejects that there was any such easement or servitude attaching to these water bottoms, and that therefore any diminishment of value resulting from that cause ought not be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.360" offset="5964511">The Court does not directly address the other kinds of public trust claimed by the United States, but apparently rejects them, and since the whole burden of the argument by the United States was that that aspect had been overvalued, the instructions to the jury in valuation had said the owner may use his lands as he sees fit only subject to harborlines, and indeed the government filed a petition for rehearing, pointing again to this overvaluation question and the diminishment in value due to the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.782" offset="6138173">It is hard to see that the Court didn't reject that argument out of hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.805" offset="6174326">The other case to which I would call the Court' attention is the insurance case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.099" offset="6219466">That was a case in which the United States sued on behalf of Mission Indians seeking the quiet title, their Indian possessory title only to occupy the land which had been the subject of a Mexican grant, claiming that this kind of less than fee title was not a proper subject for adjudication by the land commission and that the Indians would not have been required to put it forward in the 1850's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.523" offset="6357184">The Court, adhering to an earlier decision, said not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.335" offset="6376410">The Indians should have put forth their claim or the government should have put it forth on their behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.658" offset="6405771">That was now done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.035" offset="6411205">It is now far too late, and the Indian claim must fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.705" offset="6433879">It seems to us that once again this stands for the proposition that a claim of less than full fee title is one which if not preserved in these confirmation proceedings is indeed lost to the claimant, and that claimant is anyone who claims derivatively from the United States, here the state of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.271" offset="6552162">The combined effect of these two decisions is to reject any notion that the reservation of usages or servitudes in the standard boilerplate can be read as preserving the kinds of public rights--</text>

            <text syncTime="1779.524" offset="7265200">Well, Your Honor, there are four possible bases for a federal question, as Summa has stated in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.130" offset="7303652">The Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo is a possible basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.222" offset="7315982">However, we do not challenge the validity of the treaty and we don't think that it requires an interpretation of the treaty in order to determine this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.438" offset="7348896">Furthermore, the treaty did say that the United States was to inviolably respect prior existing titles, but it did not state what those titles were, so we think the treaty is not involved here, the interpretation of it, that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.150" offset="7411695">The Act of 1851 is another possible basis for federal jurisdiction, but again, we do not challenge the validity of the Act, and we don't think that it needs to be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.599" offset="7453490">The Act simply set forth a procedure for confirming preexisting titles, but it did not create new federal titles.</text>

            <text syncTime="1934.429" offset="7884824">The United States was free to grant any of its proprietary rights to Mexican grantees and thereby enlarge those rights, but we would say that again it is a local question to determine exactly what was granted by Mexico and then what the grantee ended up with as a result of the confirmatory grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.514" offset="7965177">The only other possible basis for federal jurisdiction is the equal footing doctrine, and while that does have its basis in the Constitution, we believe that that question has already been answered by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.026" offset="8031215">The Lewis Bluepoint Oyster Company versus Briggs was a case in which this Court affirmed the state decision below interpreting a pre-Revolutionary War crown grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.609" offset="8089520">In that case, it was held that a grant by the crown of tide and submerged lands passed only the crown's proprietary rights or use provatim in the lands subject to the public rights in the lands or use publicum, and that after the Revolution, the state succeeded to the remaining public rights the use publicum or public trust, just as it succeeded to the full ownership of tide and submerged lands that had not previously been granted, and that is all that the state seeks here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.708" offset="8205922">We think that that question has already been answered, and under the equal footing doctrine, rights in tidelands that are less than full ownership did pass to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.237" offset="8244060">Of course, that is a federal question, but once again, we think it has been answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.422" offset="8260779">Almost 150 years ago, in fact, in New Orleans versus the United States, this Court held that public rights arising under a prior sovereign would be recognized and respected even if they had been expressly rejected in confirmation proceedings, because public rights, in contrast to private rights, could not be so extinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.806" offset="8350326">Rather, they survived, and on statehood, these rights held by the prior sovereign passed to the state to be administered to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.410" offset="8380733">We think that this case presents an even stronger case for affirmation of public rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2345.683" offset="9529807">It had to determine the validity of title and then if found to be valid to locate them on the ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="2403.005" offset="9759162">The fact of the character of the land that would be encompassed within a rancho was really irrelevant to the General Land Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.424" offset="9784762">For example, many years before the La Ballona survey was approved by the General Land Office, it had approved the survey for the rancho that was involved in the Coronado Beach case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2444.955" offset="9926868">It is true that a statement was made by Commissioner Drummond that the inner bay is not an arm of the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.735" offset="9950065">However, for one thing, it was a not irrelevant determination to what they were doing, and secondly, it was superseded by the Secretary of the Interior's decision on the case which didn't mention the character of the land at all, and simply said that the survey's northeastern and northwestern boundaries had been correctly located, and furthermore, the subject of the instant case is not in that inner bay.</text>

            <text syncTime="2493.513" offset="10121115">For that reason, it has never been determined otherwise than to be tidal, and that was what the experts at trial looked to, not the character of the entire inner bay as to whether it was tidelands historically, but only that part of the inlet that is involved in this case, and that was found to be tidelands today and tidelands for the last 900 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2923.761" offset="11842166">So this was strictly a case of whether the United States was going to have to pay for this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.899" offset="11866722">It argued, Number One, that it shouldn't have to because under Mexican law there was a servitude... this language, without prejudice to the servitudes existed in that grant as well... and that the servitude for military occupation would allow it to be able to get this land free of payment of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.328" offset="11932446">But this Court looked at servitude in that grant and determined that there was no such servitude under Mexican law, that the military right of occupancy could not exist under Mexican law on private property, and where it could exist, the Mexican government would have to pay compensation, so therefore there was no servitude under Mexican law that would get the United States out from having to pay compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.600" offset="12033487">The only other question that the Court addressed in its opinion is whether fee title to tide and submerged lands would have passed in the confirmatory patent in that case, and it said, it acknowledged that tidelands are usually held by the state, but said that since we had the obligation to recognized preexisting titles, and since Mexico had the ability to convey these lands, that if they were encompassed within a confirmatory patent, the only thing we could do was recognize them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.616" offset="12157517">The state's title was held in abeyance until they were finally located, and if it was found to include tide and submerged lands, that title related back to the original grant, which said the state never had any interest in it as far as the fee is concerned, but we say that since the sovereign retained the public rights, those public rights then came to California on its admission to the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="3650.989" offset="14751058">Only briefly, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.208" offset="14759939">First, on a factual matter, I wanted to be sure that Mr. Justice Rehnquist had his question answered with respect to the map attached to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.534" offset="14793272">The property in issue, as I believe you were correctly saying at the end of the colloquy, is the Ballona lagoon area there just north of the channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.950" offset="14838934">The area of black line is the area which the state says may be public trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.728" offset="14874042">In other words, that may be the area where they assert public trust interests if they win this case with respect to the Ballona Lagoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.522" offset="14901210">Mr. Justice Brennan, on your factual question, I think the answer is, a landowner, our client, and other landowners would be able to undertake any development on the property only at their peril, only at the peril that subsequently the state would assert that it was inconsistent with the public trust.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3715.229" offset="15007998">But if they get the permission in the first place, that determination is made by the commission, is it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Warren M. Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="3721.445" offset="15032867">That determination is made by the State Lands Commission, but after a rather exhaustive proceeding, and as you understand, Mr. Justice, the State Lands Commission could insist that the property be kept in open space without the payment of compensation if you were to uphold this public trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.845" offset="15094516">With respect to the provision of the grant relating to traversing roads, I think I should say before I conclude that that provision is in the 1839 Mexican grant, but it does not appear in the 1873 patent from the United States to petitioner's predecessors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.727" offset="15186049">Once again, that is the kind of an issue the Board of Land Commissioners were fully competent to pass on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.553" offset="15209350">The fact that it does not appear in the patent, I think, should be decisive here in addition to the fact that this Court has never held that language preserved so broad and pervasive and permanent a trust... or a property interest as is involved here.</text>
