            <label>Mr. F. Cortez Bell, III</label>
            <text syncTime="60.289" offset="381814">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.539" offset="386829">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court:</text>
            <text syncTime="64.790" offset="399891">The instant matter before the Court this afternoon, Paton v. Yount, presents this Court a broad, general question dealing with the impact of pretrial publicity upon the ability to select and empanel a fair and impartial jury, as well as a question dealing with what if any standard is to be provided to the federal courts for purposes of reviewing a state court conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.908" offset="500305">However, contained within that broad and general question is a much narrower, much smaller question.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.062" offset="524965">However, that question is very important, and that being what standard is to be applied by a federal court to a state court determination of the impartiality of not only just one juror but of a jury panel as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.504" offset="586718">Now, the basic factual history setting forth these particular issues have previously been exhaustively covered both in the record and in the brief of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.677" offset="623394">With regard to the 2254 analysis, the respondents in their brief rather summarily dismiss this particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.716" offset="663518">However, it is the petitioners' assertion that this issue is very important not only to this particular case but also to the federal circuits and the federal district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.124" offset="705210">The courts since the inception of federal habeas corpus review have constantly struggled with the question as to how much deference should be given to a state court determination, and of course, as part of that struggle, that has led to a conflict between the state and the federal court systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.568" offset="775009">With the amendment in 1966 of Section 2254 by adding a provision 2254(d), Congress initially made an attempt to attempt to alleviate some of this particular conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.078" offset="833001">However, it seems that due to the recent influx of cases that have been decided on the basis of 2254, that particular provision has led to more litigation rather than ceasing the litigation in the various federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.838" offset="896008">It wasn't until this Court's decision in Sumner v. Mata in 1981 that this court orally addressed in that particular opinion what standard of review, what should the federal courts do with regard to state court determinations.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. F. Cortez Bell, III</label>
            <text syncTime="207.366" offset="970196">State court determinations basically as to factual matters.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="210.751" stopTime="211.437">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="210.751" offset="983675">Fact, yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="f_cortez_bell_iii" startTime="211.437" stopTime="262.136">
            <label>Mr. F. Cortez Bell, III</label>
            <text syncTime="211.437" offset="986496">Yes, not the mixed questions of fact and law.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.822" offset="999976">With regard to that particular decision, it set forth that the federal courts must not only note the provisions of 2254, but that they must go one step further and indicate the basis of their analysis so the reviewing court could review their determination, on what basis did they decide that the state court determination as to a factual matter would not be accorded the presumption of correctness?</text>
            <text syncTime="239.870" offset="1100181">Now, in essence, what we have in the present case before the court today, we have a state trial court and Pennsylvania State Supreme Court determination as to the issue of juror impartiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.530" offset="1154829">So the first question that must be addressed is is this a factual determination, or is this a determination of a mixed question of fact and law?</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="262.136" offset="1189207">This was at the second state trial, was it not, Mr. Bell?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="272.076" offset="1229017">Is it correct that this, the act charged in the indictment occurred in 1966?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="f_cortez_bell_iii" startTime="279.681" stopTime="766.827">
            <label>Mr. F. Cortez Bell, III</label>
            <text syncTime="279.681" offset="1259424">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.147" offset="1261305">The actual occurrence in this particular case was April 28 of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.489" offset="1306653">The first trial was held with a decision being reached by the jury October 7 of 1966, and then the second trial occurred in November 20th of '70, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.059" offset="1332985">With regard to the issue as to whether this is a factual determination, I would submit to the court that what we have in essence here is a determination of a credibility issue by the trial court judge, in this particular case, Judge Charry, and hearing the indications from the person on the voir dire, that person indicating as to whether they had an opinion, did not have an opinion, whether it was fixed or unfixed, or even where they could set that opinion aside, what the trial court judge was doing in that case was determining the credibility of that particular person, was what they were saying is believable based upon their demeanor, their tone, the inflection in their voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.138" offset="1505288">Now, this particular issue as to credibility is a very difficult issue to determine on the basis of appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.926" offset="1536426">As this Court has indicated that based upon a record before the appellate courts and any appellate court this applies to, even within the States, it is very difficult to have a flavor of what went on actually during the course of the trial, during the course of the voir dire examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.287" offset="1601837">So what we have here is a determination by the trial judge as to these individual jurors and as to the panel as a whole, the 12 individuals that were selected, that they were impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.428" offset="1650425">Now, based upon this Court's decision, in Marshall v. Longberger, which indicated that a credibility determination of a witness is such that it should, or great deference should be given to the trial judge, in this particular case, the trial judge in Clearfield County.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.806" offset="1719910">I submit to the Court that what we are dealing with here is an issue as to fact, not a mixed question as to the law in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.210" offset="1749585">The law in this particular case, Irvin v. Dowd, which the Federal Court of Appeal in the Third Circuit applied to this particular case, I submit to the Court was misapplied.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.618" offset="1795143">What the Court of Appeals did in essence was determine the statistical analysis based on the individuals as a whole who were not selected for the panel for various reasons, and used that in order to overturn the sworn testimony of the individuals on their voir dire indicating that either yes or no, they had opinions, and yes or no, that they would set them aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.235" offset="1893677">In essence, we also have a decision not only as to this credibility, but also as indicated before this particular Court, in various other cases of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.626" offset="1943205">Prior to the beginnings of 2254(d), which was in 1966... and I just note in passing that Irvin v. Dowd predated that in 1961... the various decisions of this Court mention this issue as to juror impartiality and the struggle that was working with regard to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.873" offset="2024185">Clear back in 1878 in Reynolds v. United States, they talk about publicity at that early date, and they indicated the struggle that once again occurred with challenges for cause as to publicity, as to prejudice, as to the jurors to be selected, and also in the Holt v. United States in 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.168" offset="2105373">At that particular time with regard to those cases, the Court did not deal with a 2254 analysis but simply indicated that a state court determination with regard to those particular issues, which it did indicate at that time was a mixed question of fact and law, should be dealt with by the Court by granting great deference to the trial court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.884" offset="2192204">Even in Irvin v. Dowd there is a citation to the Reynolds case and to Holt indicating once again that unless the error is manifest as shown by the record before this particular Court, that the court should defer to that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.643" offset="2259287">As I mentioned, since the 2254 came into effect, this Court has on several occasions dealt with this particular issue once again, initially in Sumner v. Mata which was once again a mixed question as to fact and law dealing with a photographic display to various witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.556" offset="2346954">There were several questions addressed at that particular time, in particular dealing with the circumstances surrounding the identification as to whether the victim had sufficient time in order to accurately see what occurred and who her assailants were, or the assailants were, whether the witness failed to give an adequate description to the authorities, and thirdly, whether there was any pressure placed upon the individual by prison officials in order to get him to identify this particular individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.676" offset="2467430">Now, this Court has on two occasions with regard to Sumner v. Mata addressed this particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.480" offset="2494598">Initially in 1981 the Court vacated the decision, remanded it back to the Court of Appeals for purposes of applying a 2254 analysis to these particular matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.053" offset="2544962">The Court of Appeals retained jurisdiction, rendered its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.707" offset="2563561">The issue came back up before this particular Court once again in Sumner v. Mata in 1962, I believe, and it was once again vacated and remanded by this Court on the basis that the Court of Appeals had improperly applied 2254 to this factual determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.253" offset="2637749">In Marshall v. Longberger, as I have mentioned to the court this morning or this afternoon, that was a case dealing with a murder prosecution where the State or the Commonwealth attempted to use a prior conviction of the individual in order to fit it into its aggravated circumstances range such that they could gain the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.201" offset="2729491">With regard to that particular case, the Court has held that a federal court has no license to redetermine the credibility of the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.992" offset="2772645">In that case, the Court of Appeals, what they have done there was they attempted to redetermine whether this individual's plea of guilt in another state which was used for purposes of attempting to gain this conviction, whether that was voluntarily entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.150" offset="2829278">They went into great depth dealing with the guilty plea colloquy, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.986" offset="2848609">And this Court indicated that the federal courts shouldn't redetermine that issue as to credibility, they should allow it to stand and accord it the deference of 2254(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="687.409" offset="2890300">And most recently, in the case of Busham v. Spain in this Court in 1983, December of 1983, in this particular case, a juror who was on a case subsequently realized during the course of the testimony that she had some knowledge at to the victim involved in another homicide which indirectly related to this particular case through one of the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.244" offset="2997716">She had some ex parte discussions with the court with regard to that, and the record indicates that more or less he indicated as long as it is not brought up again, I don't think you have a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.850" offset="3036064">However, defense counsel after the conviction discovered that this occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.852" offset="3052155">Obviously he filed a petition before the court, a hearing was held, and the court at that particular time... this is the lower court, the trial court... made a determination with regard to that particular juror that her... she was not biased, she was not prejudiced as a result of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.445" offset="3114536">This Court, upon reviewing that, held in essence that this was a determination of fact because it dealt with impartiality, it dealt with the credibility to be accorded that particular witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.252" offset="3161660">So the petitioners before this Court at this particular time would assert to this Court that what we have in this particular case is a question as to this credibility, and who better to make a determination as to--</text>

            <text syncTime="871.411" offset="3626327">The petitioner's position with regard to that particular matter, and in specific, with regard to Mr. Hrin, we did not feel that he entered the Jury box with an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.100" offset="3665092">The testimony at the voir dire obviously is ambiguous.</text>

            <text syncTime="888.339" offset="3694036">In the next sentence, practically, he says that he would require some evidence before he would charge his opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="896.462" offset="3726532">What we would submit to the Court are two things with regard to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.080" offset="3741056">First of all, as to his testimony that he would require some evidence, he has never indicated that he would require some evidence by either the prosecution or the defense to change that.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.952" offset="3784524">He simply says that he would enter the box with an open mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.071" offset="3796958">At one point he does indicate in the voir dire examination that he would listen to the evidence presented and decide the case solely on the evidence and the facts presented to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.761" offset="3847740">We would submit that he did not enter with an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.680" offset="3859443">He entered to the extent where he said, hey, I have heard this publicity to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.817" offset="3883998">My opinion that I had was based upon what I have read in the paper, et cetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="951.544" offset="3946901">However, be indicated that once evidence has started to be presented, we submit once the prosecution started to present evidence, he will begin to develop with his open mind an analysis as to that, he would look at it as to an open mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.836" offset="4000087">Judge Charry in his denial of the challenge for cause in essence based it upon the fact that he said that he could go in with an open mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.042" offset="4036867">However, even after that challenge for cause, what occurred was that defense counsel continue to question Mr. Hrin when on questioning him after that point, and on page 89a of the record before this particular Court, he questioned with Mr. Hrin with a, in essence a double question.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.437" offset="4110428">He asked him whether he could set aside his opinion, whether it was solid, unsolid, or however you wish to describe it, or whether he could enter the jury box and would need some evidence before he could change his mind, and he asked him to think about it beforehand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.846" offset="4172077">In response to that, he said I have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.148" offset="4181272">Defense counsel said is that a yes or a no, or could I please have a yes or no, and he said I think I could enter it with a very open mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.054" offset="4212932">And then he related it to some of the requirements of his day-to-day use, he being a chemist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.022" offset="4232785">He indicated that oftentimes, whenever you go into a procedure believing or even thinking that a certain outcome was going to come, even time tested tests that he has run before, during the course of that test circumstances charge, things are shown to him through those tests which make him change his mind as to what the proper analysis would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.435" offset="4318467">With regard to Mr. Hrin's specific, we would indicate to the Court that although the defense did challenge him for cause, as I have indicated, and it was denied, they continued to question him, and at that time we would submit he did give a proper response.</text>

            <text syncTime="1130.474" offset="4662552">You are correct under Rose v. Lundy, the District Court gave him the option as to whether he wished to either amend his petition at that time or withdraw it and proceed to exhaust his state court remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.282" offset="4713856">I do not recall as to whether he specifically addressed that his counsel was ineffective due to a failure to either further challenge Mr. Hrin after these statements or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.657" offset="4755339">In essence, with regard to Mr. Hrin, however, after that initial challenge for cause was denied and he was questioned and gave a proper response, what occurred was the defense counsel subsequently accepted him as a juror even though they did have peremptory challenges still remaining to them at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.049" offset="4820854">What I think is important in this case, however, and we shouldn't lose sight of it, is nine of the jurors were accepted by the defense without challenges of any kind, either challenges for cause or peremptorily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.424" offset="4866412">With regard to those particular challenges, it's important to note that one of the challenges was used as to Mr. Hrin, the challenge for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.447" offset="4902460">The other two came with regard to the last two actual jurors who were selected.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.805" offset="5159923">In essence, Your Honors, once a determination is made with regard to the issue as to what deference or what is begun with the state court determination as to juror impartiality, at that point then we must apply the test as to pretrial publicity, etcetera, to determine what if anything had occurred in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.338" offset="5258039">Now, the Court of Appeals decision, in essence they indicate they apply an Irvin analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.242" offset="5281654">However, I would submit to the court that that is more or less misconstrued here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.712" offset="5299522">The Court of Appeals placed great reliance upon the number of individuals that were excluded, upon the overall picture, the overall publicity, the number of individuals that were challenged for cause, and the percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.770" offset="5347796">I believe they indicated it was something like 77 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.405" offset="5362320">However, this case can be distinguished from Irvin v. Dowd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.940" offset="5380501">First of all, this case as a case that falls under 2254(d), and dependent upon this Court's decision as to whether this is a question of fact or mixed question, we get into the area as to what is to happen after 2254(d) with regard to cases such as Irvin v. Dowd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.270" offset="5461794">The instant case involves a situation where the actual counsel conducted the voir dire examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.109" offset="5493141">In Irvin v. Dowd the judge himself conducted voir dire examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.013" offset="5512785">In Irvin v. Dowd, we have to look at the scope of the voir dire allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.215" offset="5529608">Obviously in this case we did not have voir dire as long as was exhibited in Irvin v. Dowd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.218" offset="5557612">However, in essence, what occurred was since counsel was themselves conducting it, there were many leading questions, there was great leniency given to both counsel with regard to their conduct of voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.412" offset="5614349">I think even the Court of Appeals does indicate that great leniency was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.382" offset="5634203">That is what led, I would submit to the Court, to the lengthy voir dire, this constant bickering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.634" offset="5651234">If you look at the total voir dire, there is constant bickering back and forth between counsel and the court as to what the extent of the voir dire should be, how far it should go, whether questions have been asked and answered, constantly, over and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.608" offset="5703166">So the scope of the voir dire is different, and also we have a difference in the degree of publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.511" offset="5726780">In Irvin v. Dowd, the very day before he went to trial, there was a newspaper article published that indicated he had confessed to the crime involved in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.150" offset="5773278">In the Yount case, basically the press that occurred just prior to trial, yes, it did indicate that this was a retrial that was coming once again before the Court of Common Pleas of Clearfield County, but in essence, what it did at that particular time was basically factual indications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.945" offset="5840465">There is a great dispute even with the basic factual determinations to which we are certain 2254 apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.435" offset="5870454">The Court of Appeals says that there were 66 newspaper article in between the end of the second trial and the beginning of the... excuse me, between the end of the first trial and the beginning of the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.592" offset="5919042">In our brief we submit to the Court that there were 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.827" offset="5935969">What has occurred here is, and in Judge Charry's opinions he also, I believe he says 17, what has occurred here is that we are trying to compare apples with oranges more or less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.235" offset="5977660">The Court of Appeals is looking from the end of the first trial to the commencement of testimony in the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.489" offset="6002634">Judge Charry in his opinions which they hold are erroneous because he does not come up with the same 66, he is indicating from the end of the first trial to the beginning of jury selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.097" offset="6049132">Granted, there were a lot of articles published during the course of the voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.798" offset="6067940">Several panels were exhausted during the course of the voir dire examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1578.512" offset="6454761">--Your Honor, I would not hedge to make a guess at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.516" offset="6478794">With regard to the selection, as I indicated, and with regard to this, the Court at the very beginning of the selection process instructed the persons on the first panel that they should not read any press with regard to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.776" offset="6535845">It is correct that some of the very last jurors were selected from subsequent panels who would have had a chance to review it not knowing that they were even involved in the particular proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.548" offset="6578895">I believe the testimony, however, given at the time indicated that their knowledge as to the case recently was basically that it was coming up, that the jury selection was going on with regard to the particular case, not in essence as to the first trial or otherwise--</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.908" offset="6640335">I believe the total concept of the testimony given with regard to the selection of jurors indicates that in essence they were aware of the case from the prior publicity that was given to it more than the most recent publicity that it was coming once again to a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.904" offset="6728315">Returning back to the publicity issue, there are basically two manners in which this Court has indicated publicity is reviewed, an utterly corrupt the trial standard, which is Estes v. Texas, Sheppard case, etcetera, and all the courts have agreed there was not this type of publicity with regard to this case, or of an actual prejudice claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.100" offset="6817132">That is where the Court of Appeals bases their particular decision that the publicity was so extensive, that it so inflamed the members of the jury with regard to this and the whole community as a whole that as a result of that and looking at the individuals and the sheer number of individuals that either indicated they knew about the case, had some opinion about the case, that the sworn testimony of the individuals as a result of their process of selection of the jury, should be disregarded or should be more or less looked at in a different light, I guess the Court would say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.757" offset="6959760">With regard to that actual prejudice claim, then, the petitioners would assert to this court that the Court of Appeals did not actually apply Irvin v. Dowd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.964" offset="7000511">They looked at Irvin v. Dowd, they placed their decision upon Irvin v. Dowd, but due to the differences between Irvin v. Dowd and this case, and the impact of 2254(d) on the deference to be given to a state court determination, they did no in essence apply a full analysis with regard to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.712" offset="7083580">Your Honors, in conclusion at this particular point, the petitioners would respectfully request that this particular Court find that a state court determination as to juror impartiality is a factual determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.454" offset="7142513">It is a determination based by the trial court upon the credibility of those particular individuals, and that based upon that particular finding of this court, that 2254(d) does apply, we would ask this Court to reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals due to them not properly applying 2254(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.799" offset="7223910">They do technically make reference to it in Footnote 20, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.770" offset="7243763">They go on in Footnotes 21 and 22 to talk about their application of it to this particular case, so technically they have complied, they have gone a little bit further and attempted to indicate their analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.028" offset="7292769">However, with regard to those items that they address and the items that they seem to indicate that they found error in the factual determination of the Court, it is items as to the number of newspaper articles involved; it is items as to whether there were spectators in the courtroom or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.889" offset="7364240">All these things go into their analysis as to the publicity issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.676" offset="7379391">But they do not specifically deal in the majority opinion of the court of appeals with this issue as to the individuals selected for the jury and whether their examination shows that they were biased or unbiased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.751" offset="7431740">Mr. Chief Justice, at this time I would like to wish to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1962.223" offset="7989612">No, there's no way of knowing because that was never in the voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.975" offset="8008629">All I can set forth in the appendix are the newspaper articles that were available and they could have become familiar with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.617" offset="8055127">What can be gathered from the facts of the voir dire, however, are the many statements made by people questioned that he admitted he did it before, he confessed before, statements I think that are very accurately revealed in the testimony of Vera Krapf, one of the jurors who was a minister's wife and who when questioned indicated that the people from the congregation came to her and stated to her that it was time, that she had been selected to appear before this court, possibly to be selected as a juror, for her to come forth and be counted, and she testified that these people that came to her felt that he had received a fair trial and is lucky he didn't get the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.311" offset="8317918">And this was the atmosphere in the community from which this jury was selected and from which some 72 percent of the jurors admitted that they had an opinion of guilt and were successfully challenged for cause, and a higher number of jurors admitted opinions, the question becoming primarily, as previously indicated, whether particularly one of them, Juror Hrin, was so prejudiced and partial that he should not have been permitted to sit as a juror on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.536" offset="8478833">So his testimony has already been mentioned in the first argument, indicating that he admitted that he had a fixed opinion and that he would require testimony to be presented before he could change that opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2104.048" offset="8556887">Mr. Schumacher, I think one of your opponent's positions is that if one takes Juror Hrin's various answers, as the first questioned by the defense, then by the prosecution, one gets several different versions of an answer to that question, that admittedly that answer was given, but also something that could be called contradictory to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.777" offset="8643822">Why isn't that an ambiguity in his overall testimony that is best resolved by the trial judge?</text>

            <text syncTime="2236.548" offset="9086859">Obviously the trial judge can see the person, can hear the testimony, and can reflect on the way it's given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.720" offset="9119564">However, it's the words here that are spoken that are so important, not necessarily how they're spoken, and the words nevertheless are in the record that he would require evidence to put aside his opinion, and that it is a fixed opinion even though at some future time he says it isn't as fixed as it was before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.151" offset="9205350">When the trial judge resolved that issue, he said, he stated it was fixed, next he stated it isn't as fixed as it previously was; therefore, it isn't a fixed opinion, which I consider to be totally illogical, and I would not accept that resolution of that issue whether or not the man were before me or not.</text>
