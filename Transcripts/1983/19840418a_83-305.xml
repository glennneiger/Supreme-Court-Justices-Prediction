            <label>Mr. Charles R.B. Kirk</label>
            <text syncTime="78.381" offset="458953">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.416" offset="463133">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.535" offset="475567">Recently in South Dakota versus Neville this Court again decried the carnage caused by drunken drivers on our highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.724" offset="512348">Spurred on by increasing public awareness, and encouraged by the federal government, the states are stepping up law enforcement efforts to combat this national problem, and one of the most effective tools in law enforcement's arsenal is the breath alcohol test.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.400" offset="579012">Such tests are used in every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.220" offset="602313">In California, which I am sure is typical, breath alcohol tests are used in two-thirds of all drunk driving arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.445" offset="639198">Evidential breath test instruments provide a rapid, economical, and accurate means of immediately determining the suspect's blood alcohol content.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.586" offset="687786">Because they are self-contained, automatic units, they can be easily and accurately operated by a field officer with minimal training.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.541" offset="727597">The ease and rapidity of operation allows the officer to complete the test quickly and return to the highway to do his job.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.797" offset="764586">Immediate results also permit additional sample collection where an unexpectedly low result suggests intoxication by combination of alcohol and drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.641" offset="815995">Breath testing is also the least intrusive of the options from the suspect's point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.628" offset="843894">It does not involve bodily intrusion or invasion of privacy, and assures the shortest period of detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.199" offset="874196">Breath testing is broadly accepted as valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.935" offset="889138">Self-contained devices avoid the possibility of human error or manipulation and allow subsequent checks upon the accuracy of the test system.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.891" offset="933024">Now, this case is here on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.528" offset="947548">After a California Court of Appeals held unconstitutional as a violation of federal due process use of an evidential breath test instrument unless that device preserves the breath sample actually tested for possible retesting by the defendant or alternatively a procedure is followed which collects an equivalent sample for the defendant's use.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.262" offset="1054441">In the context of this particular case, the instrument at issue is an Intoxolizer, widely used on a national basis, and constituting 82 percent of the evidential breath test devices in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.605" offset="1111806">Now, I will first focus on the machine itself, and then I am going to outline why its use does not offend due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.628" offset="1147959">The Intoxolizer does not save any sample for possible retesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.365" offset="1170842">In use, the suspect blows through a tube leading into a chamber within the machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.619" offset="1199891">When the device determines that the air deep in the lungs has been reached, the sample is momentarily held for analysis using infrared light, and the blood alcohol content is measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.493" offset="1247433">Then the test sample is automatically pumped out of the machine, and the chamber is purged with clear air.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.147" offset="1273974">The purge cycle promotes test integrity by ensuring that no residual alcohol remains as a contaminant, that the instrument is starting from zero, and that no capricious event occurs to interfere with test accuracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.157" offset="1334055">It is actually a diagnostic step which protects the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.061" offset="1353700">The machine must be purged to prepare it for another test on that same person or another individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.583" offset="1383793">Thus the test sample purged to clear the machine is automatically destroyed as an integral part of the analytical process, and it is never collected or reduced to a form which permits practical retention.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.093" offset="1445755">The decision of the Court of Appeal by its terms extends not only to the Intoxolizer but to all evidential breath test machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.615" offset="1487864">The others approved for use in California also destroy the sample during the testing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.519" offset="1511479">Hence the decision condemns as unconstitutional all California breath testing, and should such a rule be extended to the other states, will greatly impair the effort to control the drinking driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.778" offset="1564560">The great national concern over this disquieting prospect is reflected in the amici briefs which have been filed in support of the state of California.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.003" offset="1613461">Mr. Kirk, how widespread is the use of the Intoxolizer around the country?</text>

            <text syncTime="371.824" offset="1632687">As far as I know, Your Honor, it is used virtually from shore to shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.244" offset="1658392">Obviously, each state is free to choose its own machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.680" offset="1676155">The National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration has approved a great number.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.051" offset="1709592">I know that the Intoxolizer is favored and used exclusively in a number of states.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="402.026" offset="1753582">General Kirk, would you just help me out on one thing?</text>
            <text syncTime="403.961" offset="1761314">I may have gotten the wrong impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.478" offset="1767375">I thought from the material at the beginning of your opponent's brief that there was another breath testing device that did conserve the sample, and that was permissible to use in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.817" offset="1804677">Am I wrong on that?</text>

            <text syncTime="415.686" offset="1808126">--Your Honor, that is talking about the indium tube device or actually the gas chromatograph, which analyzes an indium tube as part of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.542" offset="1851593">That is true, that exists, and that is approved in California.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles R.B. Kirk</label>
            <text syncTime="434.480" offset="1883358">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.130" offset="1885971">In fact--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="435.697" stopTime="436.447">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="435.697" offset="1888269">--in California?</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_rb_kirk" startTime="436.447" stopTime="818.980">
            <label>Mr. Charles R.B. Kirk</label>
            <text syncTime="436.447" offset="1891195">--It is not widely used in California, and there is only one single county which has ever made any kind of continuous use, and that is the county of San Bernadino, which since 1973 has used it because of the difficulty of collecting breath samples in a widespread county.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.393" offset="1974996">Now, on what basis did the California court make such a wholesale condemnation in Trombetta, purportedly under the due process clause of the federal constitution as interpreted by the California Supreme Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="472.689" offset="2036227">In People versus Hitch, that court looked to the opinion in Brady versus Maryland and divined a constitutional principle requiring preservation of any evidence which might possibly be favorable to the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.949" offset="2097249">Now, I say divined because that is exactly what the California Supreme Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.602" offset="2119819">The Hitch rule cannot be found in Brady versus Maryland or in any other decision of this Court nor can it be found anywhere in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.541" offset="2159629">In a criminal case, the state must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but the Constitution does not require proof beyond all possible doubt and to an absolute certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.384" offset="2215009">The state need not negate all speculative possibilities, which seems to be the primary focus of respondents and their amici.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.657" offset="2256073">And the Trombetta decision itself imposes sample preservation to make proof of guilt an absolute certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.012" offset="2293481">The Hitch-Trombetta preservation requirement is predicated upon a claimed need to provide the defendant with any evidence which has a reasonable possibility of yielding results favorable to the defense or casting doubt upon the state's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.574" offset="2363698">It was just that "might possibly" standard which this Court recently rejected in United States versus Valenzuela Vernow.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.663" offset="2400060">The Hitch-Trombetta standard is in fact no standard at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.567" offset="2419704">As this Court observed in Killian versus United States, almost everything is evidence of something, and in Valenzuela Vernow, possibilities of favorable evidence are limited only by the imaginations of counsel and judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.612" offset="2483861">This is especially true, I believe, with any analytical measuring or recording method.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.599" offset="2511864">Ordinarily, the only prerequisite to the admission of scientific tests are proof of the expert's qualifications, accuracy of the equipment, and reliability of the method followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.174" offset="2566095">It is not required that the results of accepted methods be infallible to be admissible, possibilities of error going to weight rather than to admissibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.814" offset="2608726">The Trombetta and Hitch cases depart from this rule applicable to physical testing and require as a matter of federal due process that there must be a secondary verification of the primary test before the primary test is admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.509" offset="2679466">Now, the irony in this case is that there are few areas in which the defendant is so well protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.115" offset="2709873">The Intoxolizer, as are all evidential breath test instruments in California, has been tested and approved by the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration, a neutral federal agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.107" offset="2761908">It has also been subjected to the rigid scrutiny, including blood-breath correlation studies on live subjects by the California Department of Health, which is a neutral agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.182" offset="2818124">It is not involved in law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.832" offset="2824811">It does not sell machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.634" offset="2831917">This is the neutral agency designated by our legislature as having the expertise in this scientific field.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.407" offset="2867025">And when an instrument is approved, it can only be used following regulated procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.096" offset="2897850">It is periodically checked for accuracy, and under these controls, the Department of Health has itself concluded that there is no possibility of undetected error.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.035" offset="2941526">Now, Brady cannot be the source of the Hitch-Trombetta preservation rule, since Brady is not a preservation case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.724" offset="2976322">It is a disclosure case.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.776" offset="2984576">Brady requires the state to disclose exonerating material evidence to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.080" offset="3009758">It is based upon the notion of fair play inherent in our judicial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.751" offset="3032433">The form or continued physical existence of the evidence is irrelevant to the duty to disclose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.257" offset="3062421">This case does not present a Brady violation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.542" offset="3083633">To violate the rule, there must be a suppression of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.945" offset="3101187">The evidence must be favorable to the defense, and the evidence must be material.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.182" offset="3122189">Destruction in the ordinary course of an analytical process is not suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.753" offset="3148416">This was not evidence favorable to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.888" offset="3160955">The contrary is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.088" offset="3165762">Nor would a preserved or separately collected sample yield material evidence, since reanalysis is itself subject to error and cannot be verified.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.346" offset="3206826">Thus a discrepancy between the evidential breath test results and the results of referee analysis creates a conflict in the evidence which can be resolved but only by going back to the evidential breath test and rechecking its accuracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.122" offset="3269938">This can already be done without a preserved sample.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.974" offset="3281327">Trombetta thus imposes a duty of preservation yielding at most inconclusive results, creating the circular route back to the starting point, which is the evidential breath test machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.282" offset="3330542">Certainly the Constitution does not require such wasted effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.953" offset="3349246">In any event, sample prevention was not necessary, and therefore not material in a constitutional sense to enable a probe of the accuracy of the test results since several suitable alternate methods were available for this purpose.</text>
