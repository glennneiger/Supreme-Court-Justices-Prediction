            <text syncTime="13.574" offset="186672">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.181" offset="205062">On the 7th day of November of 1981, Denver Detective Sergeant Don DeNovellis obtained information from a confidential informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.989" offset="248321">The informant told Detective DeNovellis that a person known as Antonio Guadalupe Nunez had been seen by the informant within the last 24 hours preparing heroin for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.295" offset="309552">He was diluting the heroin and putting it into balloons, a common mode of packaging for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.761" offset="335466">The informant told Detective DeNovellis that Mr. Nunez said that he had recently been to Mexico and in Mexico he had purchased five ounces of heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.586" offset="378724">Detective DeNovellis then obtained a search warrant based upon this information and, along with Adams County Sheriff's officers, went to Mr. Nunez's home in Adams County, Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.658" offset="431074">They entered the home and searched Mr. Nunez and from his pocket they took 15 balloons which contained heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.562" offset="462630">Mr. Nunez was charged with possession of a Schedule One Controlled Substance in Colorado and his counsel filed a motion to suppress the fruits of that search, alleging in part there was no probable cause for that search.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.180" offset="525115">He also filed a motion for the disclosure of this particular confidential informant who provided this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.692" offset="551133">A hearing was held in September of 1982 upon that motion for disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.034" offset="576524">At that time, Mr. Nunez himself testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.922" offset="596063">He stated among other things that he was off in the mountains hunting in his motor home, that he had to been to Mexico, and that the only people who had been at his home within 24 hours of the 7th day of November of 1981 were members of his immediate and extended family.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.759" offset="667430">He also said at one point during cross examination that he did not know what heroin was.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.226" offset="693343">The court, based upon this information, ordered the prosecution to disclose the name of the informant.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="148.315" offset="725631">Mr. Bernard, do you think that the Colorado court based its holding on federal law?</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven Leon Bernard</label>
            <text syncTime="155.828" offset="755724">I certainly do, Justice O'Connor, and for the following reasons:</text>
            <text syncTime="159.343" offset="769725">The court in the case of Colorado versus Nunez relied upon three prior Colorado decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.293" offset="797520">The first decision was People versus Dailey which had been decided approximately one and a half years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.072" offset="828658">In People versus Dailey, the Colorado Supreme Court referred at one point to the Colorado Constitution, but at that time it was only for the amount of information necessary to begin a veracity hearing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="187.440" stopTime="205.886">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="187.440" offset="882156">Well, on that point, I think Dailey states that in Colorado the rule is that a defendant is entitled to a veracity hearing once he shows a good faith basis for believing the material in the affidavit was inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.887" offset="939939">Now, do you think that that holding is based on federal law?</text>

            <text syncTime="215.648" offset="995005">But, the issue in this case concerns the disclosure of the informant.</text>

            <text syncTime="234.734" offset="1071283">Justice Lohr said exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.905" offset="1080060">They have adopted the same test of Roviaro versus McCray.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.294" offset="1093539">If I may elaborate on my answer a little bit, in the Dailey opinion, the Colorado Supreme Court said specifically that while the Colorado Constitution may support a lesser amount of evidence shown, when it talked about what consequences, and disclosure is one of the consequences, that must flow from the decision the court must make after that showing, it referred specifically to both the United States Constitution and to the Colorado Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.843" offset="1223733">At that hearing... After that hearing and after the order of disclosure, the prosecution took an interlocutory appeal to the Supreme Court of the State of Colorado in which that issue was addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.071" offset="1284651">The Colorado Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision and we petitioned for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.648" offset="1310982">This Court granted review.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.382" offset="1317879">The issue in this case is essentially twofold.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.294" offset="1409516">The first issue in this case is an issue that was reserved in Franks versus Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.243" offset="1453402">In that opinion at page 170, Justice Blackmun reserved the issue, a difficult issue, of whether an informant should be disclosed after a satisfactory showing at a veracity hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.425" offset="1502094">The issue in this case also concerns where, as in the case at bar, if the counsel for the accused and the court both concede that the credibility of the police officer of Frank is not at issue, therefore, should there be disclosure at all?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="373.162" offset="1625079">--Your Honor, I believe that this goes to a question of Fourth Amendment interpretation and the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.957" offset="1652246">First of all, beginning with Aguilar and Spinelli and with this Court's recent decision in Illinois versus Gates, there is clearly an issue of whether a confidential informant can be used in a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.515" offset="1706476">When that happens, that becomes a Fourth Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.905" offset="1720060">This is not merely a question of evidentiary law, but this is a question of the application of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.353" offset="1749840">The question is, therefore, does the Fourth Amendment require disclosure if, after a veracity hearing, there is a certain showing.</text>

            <text syncTime="422.768" offset="1823505">And, we submit, even assuming in certain situations that the Fourth Amendment does permit disclosure of an informant's name after an appropriate showing at a veracity hearing in our case, that should not be because the whole purpose of a veracity hearing is to question whether the state itself has erred in any way, whether there has been police misconduct, if the affiant's credibility is not at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.195" offset="1933219">In other words, if the affiant in good faith relied upon what he was told by his informant, then there is no purpose, no application, no deterrant result for the exclusionary rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.623" offset="2666842">And, I think in McCray versus Illinois Justice Weintraub foresaw exactly the problem that we see in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.118" offset="2704876">In the quote that I have cited in my brief, Justice Weintraub says that if a defendant knows that he can submit to the court any evidence at all, the court itself is going to order disclosure because they have no ability to impeach.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.954" offset="2780213">At that point, the informant will always be disclosed and the whole chain of information will be broken, the flow of information will be dried up.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.075" offset="2820651">If at a veracity hearing the purpose is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the accused has committed a crime and probable cause to believe that at his residence are the fruits of that crime, then in this case the disclosure of the informant is an ancillary part of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.470" offset="2930261">It is part of the probable cause determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.859" offset="2939874">Since Aguilar and Spinelli and Gates made rules under our Constitution to govern the use of confidential informants and warrants the decision whether to disclose them becomes a Fourth Amendment consideration here.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.603" offset="2998806">As I said to Justice O'Connor earlier, it is not a question of evidentiary law, state evidentiary law, it is part and parcel of the Franks versus Delaware analysis and it is part and parcel of the issue that this Court reserved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.973" offset="3060246">There is an issue as to whether there was an independent and adequate state grounds for this decision which Justice O'Connor raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.202" offset="3105177">The tests that this Court has established in a series of cases, Delaware versus Prouse, South Dakota versus Neville, culminating with Michigan versus Long, which was decided in July of 1983, I believe, indicates that this Court presumes that there is not an independent and adequate state grounds if there is not a clear and express showing on the face of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.691" offset="3219175">In this case, as far as the issue of disclosure is concerned, there was no clear and independent showing of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.061" offset="3260658">As far as any remedy to be derived from a veracity hearing, there was no clear and independent showing of state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="798.820" offset="3327635">In the Colorado Supreme Court's decision in the Nunez case... It referred, as I said earlier, to three cases... The case of Dailey, the case of Martinez, and the case of Bueno.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.419" offset="3422094">In Dailey, when the Court talked about disclosure, it referred to two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.199" offset="3441216">First, Franks versus Delaware, which was a case decided by this Court on Fourth Amendment grounds, and then the Court talked about solely in Dailey if there is the affiant's perjury or reckless disregard for the truth, the Colorado Court discussed that remedy in terms of Dailey...

            <text syncTime="1348.815" offset="5527668">Secondly, disclosure does not serve in this case, because there was no police misconduct, the Fourth Amendment, or the purposes of the exclusionary rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2057.137" offset="8360909">And, that the other issues regarding preliminary threshold showing and regarding what a defendant needs to be successful on a veracity challenge were matters decided in other cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2197.316" offset="8921706">Given that fact, as long as the Colorado Supreme Court does not run afoul of another constitutional provision by cutting off some of defendant's other rights, I don't believe it is a constitutional issue at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.654" offset="8974995">And, it is not even a federal issue which we have been arguing throughout these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.137" offset="8992968">It is purely a matter of state concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.558" offset="8998610">And, again, as Justice Marshall inquired, Colorado has not adopted any kind of per se rule so that any time there is an informant in an affidavit a defendant is entitled to disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.256" offset="9057438">In fact, Colorado, in its decisions, has clearly stated it supports the common law informant's privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.002" offset="9084396">It gives it a great deal of weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.033" offset="9092546">And, in reaction to that in the instant case, it states that a defendant must make a preliminary showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.435" offset="9130163">There is a mandatory showing a defendant must make before he can gain disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.106" offset="9148866">And, secondly, there is another safeguard built in and that is the in camera hearing, which in this case was not requested by the prosecution, but in other cases has been requested and has been granted, and is a way to actually balance this very difficult problem between keeping the information--</text>

            <text syncTime="2308.443" offset="9366205">Just one, Mr. Chief Justice, just one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.504" offset="9386372">The issue on disclosure was argued below and the record will bear that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.267" offset="9409464">But, I think that there is some confusion here between what Mr. Stern says and what I say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.233" offset="9437363">Mr. Stern suggests that this is merely a discovery issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.950" offset="9448230">I submit that it is not a discovery issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.777" offset="9463485">The issue here is the use of disclosure in a veracity hearing which triggers constitutional issues of probable cause and police misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.866" offset="9507893">It is not a question of disclosure for trial at which an accused may want to have someone who witnessed the crime present to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.144" offset="9544987">But, it is an issue of the warrant process and the warrant process is part and parcel of this Court's determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.078" offset="9576752">In Dailey, the case upon which the Colorado Supreme Court relied, when that Court discussed disclosure it referred to the Fourth Amendment, to Franks versus Delaware, to the sanctions that should fall under Franks versus Delaware, and under the Fourth Amendment, and in no place did it refer to any bit of Colorado Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.631" offset="9678943">It talked about McCray, it talked about Roviaro, it talked about Franks.</text>
