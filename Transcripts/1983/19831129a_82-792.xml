            <text syncTime="1.248" offset="156031">We will hear arguments first this morning in Grove City College v. Bell.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.402" offset="180691">Mr. Lascell, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="10.712" offset="193961">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.992" offset="207022">At issue in this case is whether a private college called Grove City College which seeks to avoid government entanglement, which seeks to remain independent, and which seeks to operate efficiently, must either expel students who receive federal scholarships, or must agree that it is subject to government regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.652" offset="305660">Grove City has never sought nor accepted any federal aid nor grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.464" offset="336903">It therefore declined to participate in the BEOG program or any other student assistance program sponsored by state or federal governments.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="57.928" offset="382774">But that assumes one of the issues in the case, that you have never received any federal funds.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_m_lascell" startTime="64.378" stopTime="66.956">
            <label>Mr. David M. Lascell</label>
            <text syncTime="64.378" offset="408583">That's correct, Mr. Justice White.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="66.956" stopTime="67.580">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="66.956" offset="418927">Yes.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. David M. Lascell</label>
            <text syncTime="67.580" offset="421435">But in terms of the statement of the case, that is the position of the college.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="71.280" stopTime="72.060">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="71.280" offset="436168">All right, that's the position.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_m_lascell" startTime="72.060" stopTime="150.250">
            <label>Mr. David M. Lascell</label>
            <text syncTime="72.060" offset="439303">The government acknowledged, as a matter of fact, that Grove City was not participating in the BEOG program, but it asked the college to help by supplying forms for students who might be eligible to participator in the BEOG program and by certifying attendance and costs at the college in order that those students might receive those awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.912" offset="546718">The government now claims that what Grove City did means that the college is operating a program which receives federal financial assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.140" offset="591649">There is no claim in this case, nor has there ever been any claim, that Grove City discriminates in any way, nor that it claims any right to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.899" offset="638669">Now, the issues in the case can be a little confusing, and we have tried to label them for the convenience of the Court in three ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.769" offset="686108">First, we have what we call the recipient issue, that is, whether Grove City operates a program which receives federal financial assistance because some of its students receive BEOG grants.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="150.249" stopTime="153.153">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="david_m_lascell" startTime="153.153" stopTime="172.929">
            <label>Mr. David M. Lascell</label>
            <text syncTime="153.153" offset="763639">Perhaps, but certainly not, not... that is a theoretical possibility, Justice White, but I don't think in this case, in fact, that is what happened, nor do I think that that is what could happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.804" offset="822258">In this case the government selects the students, the Court will recall--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="172.929" offset="842738">But you would be here making the same argument if, even if the students were just conduits through which tuition money passed.</text>

            <label>Mr. David M. Lascell</label>
            <text syncTime="181.644" offset="877638">--Well, I would be making the same arguments, but in fact, it seems to me that the BEOG grant statute does not contemplate that the students are conduits but instead contemplates that they are ultimate beneficiaries.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="195.136" stopTime="198.400">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="195.136" offset="931659">That they could use the money for anything they wanted to.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="200.650" offset="953706">Right.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. David M. Lascell</label>
            <text syncTime="201.056" offset="955273">--which could include tuition--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="201.914" stopTime="202.853">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="201.914" offset="958722">Right.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_m_lascell" startTime="202.853" stopTime="497.215">
            <label>Mr. David M. Lascell</label>
            <text syncTime="202.853" offset="962483">--But in this instance, the two students who are involved in this case in fact did not use that money for tuition.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.551" offset="993308">You will recall that neither student received that money until well after tuition and fee payments were due at the college, and in fact, if we closely examine the BEOG program, it is very evident that that money cannot come to those students until after they are in attendance for the semester which they receive the award because the certification does not occur until after students begin classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.664" offset="1109709">Under those circumstances, at Grove City, at least, the money which the students receive would not go to the institution but would be used for other educational purposes, whether to repay loans, to take care of housing, to buy books at off-campus stores, other educational purposes allowed by the statute and the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.204" offset="1191838">These BEOG awards go to students who are picked by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.672" offset="1221722">The amount of the award is determined by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.965" offset="1238963">And in this instance, the award is paid by the government directly to the students and not to the college.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.820" offset="1266340">That is the first issue, the recipient issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.631" offset="1277624">Grove City claims that it is not a recipient, and if the Court agrees, it does not need to consider what we have called issues two and three.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.127" offset="1323600">Issue two is the program issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.079" offset="1335407">What is the program or activity to be regulated if in fact Grove City is a recipient?</text>
            <text syncTime="303.593" offset="1365396">Three theories have been offered to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.200" offset="1379920">One is that the program equals the institution, institution-wide program at Grove City or any other college.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.978" offset="1422970">That's the government's historical position, and it is the position which was adopted by the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.773" offset="1446167">The second position, the second theory offered to this Court is the one that Grove City offers, that if Grove City is a recipient, the program appropriately to be regulated is the BEOG program itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.797" offset="1498307">The third theory is a new one which has been offered to this court, and that is that the entire financial aid program of a college like Grove City is that which is to be regulated, including any private money which is a part of that financial aid program.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.650" offset="1565703">That's the government's new position, offered for the first time to this Court and never before offered to the college.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.569" offset="1593393">That is the program issue, what we have called the program issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.129" offset="1615544">The third issue, which again needs to be considered only if Grove City is determined to be a recipient, is what we have called the funds termination issue: whether aid to Grove City students can be terminated solely because Grove City refused to execute an assurance of compliance which the government itself now says was overly broad when it asked Grove City to execute it, but which the government also says now can be saved by a new interpretation never before offered to the college and despite the fact that there has never been any claim of discrimination levied against this institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.644" offset="1789624">Those, therefore, are the three issues which we seek to address, the recipient issue, the program issue, and the funds termination issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.497" offset="1833092">Turning first to the recipient issue, whether or not Grove City is a recipient of federal financial assistance depends obviously, as this Court well knows, on the language of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.694" offset="1909892">Title 9 talks about receiving federal financial assistance and operating a program or activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.656" offset="1961719">It is the position of the college that receive has plain meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.933" offset="1998813">It is not a word which any one of us would have difficulty in understanding were we not lawyers arguing about a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.884" offset="2038624">Receive has a plain meaning, and to the public and the country receive means to consciously participate, and to receive, to obtain funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.347" offset="2088465">Grove City does not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.874" offset="2098601">In fact, it consciously has chosen not to participate in any federal aid program of any kind, despite the fact that those--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="497.215" stopTime="513.598">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="497.215" offset="2139979">Well, you can certainly... a legatee can certainly receive funds from a testator without having consciously participated at all, and the testator... I don't see why you put consciously participate into your definition of receive.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_m_lascell" startTime="513.598" stopTime="538.824">
            <label>Mr. David M. Lascell</label>
            <text syncTime="513.598" offset="2205494">--Only here, Justice, because I think that the grant program contemplates some deliberate action on the part of the college.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.093" offset="2251469">I don't disagree that a legatee could receive something without doing anything except being there.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.045" offset="2271218">But in this instance, I think that the scope of the grant statute itself contemplates some activity.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="538.824" offset="2306327">Then you are not talking about the generic meaning of the word "receive".</text>
            <text syncTime="541.838" offset="2318447">You are talking about the word "receive" as it appears in the statute.</text>

          <turn speaker="david_m_lascell" startTime="563.671" stopTime="631.362">
            <label>Mr. David M. Lascell</label>
            <text syncTime="563.671" offset="2405801">--Well, I don't think that it's a discrimination, though, for any protected class.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.341" offset="2436416">I think that the college could say we choose to accept only those students who take no federal aid programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.461" offset="2476958">The difficulty with that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that of the college does that, what it would be doing would be to discriminate in one way, maybe not in a protected way, but discriminate in one way against those students who in fact the Congress chose to help by these aid programs, and certainly in this instance, those students might include minorities, particularly poor minorities who would be unable to attend a college like Grove City even... I'm sorry, without these kinds of aid programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.509" offset="2645082">That seems anomalous to us because the Congress clearly intended with these aid programs to aid such students.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="631.362" offset="2676534">Does the record give us any breakdown on the composition of the students receiving this particular form of aid at Grove City?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_m_lascell" startTime="642.125" stopTime="836.375">
            <label>Mr. David M. Lascell</label>
            <text syncTime="642.125" offset="2719584">There is very little in the record about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.360" offset="2728465">Grove City has been, Justice O'Connor, co-educational since its founding, as the Court knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.357" offset="2752498">At the time that this case arose, 140 of about its 200... 2200 students, received BEOG awards under this alternate disbursal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.384" offset="2800563">There is, however, nothing in the record which indicates the proportion by which those students were divided, whether by sex, by minority, by race, by religion, by anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.643" offset="2841628">Don't forget that that... the reason for that is that the government chooses those students; Grove City does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.718" offset="2873915">Grove City simply takes the students who were there are allows them to attend once they have received those awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.513" offset="2905158">The other important point, I think, about Grove City which we should say and which should be clear and which is a part of the record is that its efficiency and operation has resulted in very high quality educational programs at very low cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.503" offset="2993033">Its tuition fee, room and board costs at the time that this case arose were just over $4000 per year, not per semester as all of us are accustomed to seeing at high quality private, independent universities and colleges in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.950" offset="3062833">One of the reasons that it has been able to do that has been because of its refusal to be entangled with any kind of government authority, and at the same time, its refusal as a part of its conscience and heritage, to discriminate against any class of people who wish to attend that institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.971" offset="3154993">That is something of which the college is very proud, and rightfully so, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.938" offset="3178816">Now, the recipient issue is one which we find very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.323" offset="3228344">The Court will recall that at the time Title 9 was enacted, there were in fact three pieces of legislation before the Congress, one a proposal from Senator Bayh, one a proposal from Congresswoman Greene, and one, an administrative proposal, and the Congress made a conscious choice about which of those proposals it chose to accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.824" offset="3362405">The position of the college is that the proposal which it chose to accept is one which includes a definition of receive which does not encompass this college operating in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.805" offset="3426248">The Congress did not say in that statute receive or benefit or assist.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.771" offset="3458118">It said receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.955" offset="3466895">It is only the regulations which expanded that receipt concept to benefit or to assistance.</text>

            <text syncTime="975.626" offset="4053605">The '71 version, for instance, applied only to public schools and to private graduate programs, and we know that in the '72 version which was eventually enacted, both those circumstances were eliminated in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.650" offset="4133644">We also know that the administrative proposal, the administration proposal, and the proposal from Representative Greene, were different than that which Senator Bayh had proposed in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.784" offset="4186202">We read that legislative history as very confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.330" offset="4208354">It was interesting to me as I reread the briefs this weekend, to see that every one of us, both amici... every amici and every litigant, cited that legislative history from Senator Bayh as supportive of our own positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.994" offset="4271048">Now, that means to me, Justice O'Connor, that really the only thing that we can examine which shows any clear change or distinction is the differences, or are the differences between the '71 legislation and the '72 legislation which was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.862" offset="4338549">And it is the college's position that in that change it became as clear as we can hope that recipient under these circumstances did not mean beneficiary or did not mean... did not mean benefit or did not mean assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.433" offset="4420782">We do not believe, by the way, that that interpretation of the statute means that discrimination will affect American higher education in ways that would be entirely improper, nor do we believe that that means the end of Title 9 enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.285" offset="4500194">We simply do not think that that's correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1167.096" offset="4819411">Private, single-sex institutions are exempt from the enforcement provisions of Title 9 currently, and I believe as well that with a narrow reading of this Court's decision in the Mississippi College case, that that can continue, so that I don't see that that will be a problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.448" offset="4908854">What I think is important, and what I think Congress did when it enacted Title 9, was to balance two very important concerns, exceptionally important; one, to prevent gender discrimination in post-secondary education in the United States; and at the same time, by very carefully constructing that Education Act of 1972, by attempting to preserve diversity in American higher education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.618" offset="5057543">Not everyone, Justice Blackmun, would think that a single-sex college is appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1302.620" offset="5361504">The program, so far as we can tell from our examination of Title 9 and from the contemporaneous history and from the statements of the commentators, the program is defined and limited by the purpose of the underlying grant statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1328.797" offset="5466307">And I think that we find support in that if we examine the funds termination provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.261" offset="5496087">The Court will recall that the funds termination provision includes a section which says that before funds can be terminated, the committee, the congressional committee having responsibility for the program must be notified of that proposed termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.425" offset="5584798">We think that that linkage is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.577" offset="5605383">The committee having responsibility must be notified in order for the program funds to be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.247" offset="5636103">We think that the statute and this Court's interpretation in North Haven mean that the program itself is to be regulated, and that the program is defined by the grant statute involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.787" offset="5706216">Here the grant statute is the BEOG program statute, and it is therefore the college's position that it is that program which is to be regulated.</text>
