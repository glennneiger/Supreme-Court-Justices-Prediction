            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="133843">We will hear arguments first this morning in Migra against Warren City School District Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.106" offset="170205">Mr. Vintilla, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="14.601" offset="192148">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in this civil rights action brought under Sections 1983 and 85, the Sixth Circuit held that res judicata principles barred the petitioner from presenting her constitutional claims in the District Court because she failed to raise them in a prior state court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.058" offset="297996">The central issue before the Court is whether a litigation of statutory issues in a state court precludes a party from pursuing her federal civil rights claims which were not raised, litigated, or decided in the prior stats court litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.005" offset="381797">This central question gives rise to two, we believe, two subsidiary questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.282" offset="410950">First, does the Ohio rule of res judicata bar the petitioner from pursuing the instant action in the federal court, and secondly, should a federal court, consistent with the Congressional policy underlying 1983, deny a civil rights plaintiff a federal forum because he or she litigated, and incidentally prevailed, on a narrow state issue in a state court against the same parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.425" offset="559534">The factual history or posture of this case, we believe, is critical to a consideration and determination of the issues before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.840" offset="613138">The petitioner, Ethel Migra, was employed by the Warren City School District Board of Education as a supervisor of elementary education.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.895" offset="665383">She was employed on a yearly basis, what is designated in Ohio as a limited contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.986" offset="697774">In Ohio, a state board of education is, I imagine, in most jurisdictions, is granted very broad discretion in the renewal or non-renewal of a teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.374" offset="751273">Now, in the event that the respondent board determines that a teacher should not be renewed, the board is required under Ohio law to notify the teacher on or before April the 30th of the year in which the contract is to expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.130" offset="834343">And then recently our Court of Ohio in Tracey versus O'Steigel Board, Six Ohio State Third 305, also held that in that notification, the board must set forth the basic reason for the non-renewal, although the teacher is not entitled to what they call cause and a hearing, cause and hearing mandate.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="209.945" offset="973523">That would be a doctrine of state law that you are--</text>

          <turn speaker="john_r_vintilla" startTime="215.299" stopTime="447.863">
            <label>Mr. John R. Vintilla</label>
            <text syncTime="215.299" offset="994943">Yes, Your Honor, the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.644" offset="1000377">It was believed that since non-tenured... non-tenured teachers are not entitled to reasons for non-renewal, since they are on a yearly basis, and each year, at the end of the school year, their contract terminations unless the school board on or before April 30th determines it should be renewed, and the teacher has until June the 4th, I believe, of that year to determine whether he or she will accept, and then they are entered into a written contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.708" offset="1132661">In our situation here, the respondent board held a meeting on April the 17th of 1979, and adopted a resolution unanimously to renew the contract of the petitioner for the ensuing year, and subsequent to that resolution or offer to continue her employment, the petitioner duly accepted and notified the board that she accepted the offer to serve for another year.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.256" offset="1286783">One week after the initial meeting of April 17th, the board called a special meeting on April the 24th, at which time it rescinded, reconsidered the renewal of the petitioner and rescinded its earlier resolution to renew her, with a majority of three, a three to one vote, and one member was absent because he was not notified of the... of the special purpose of the meeting, and he was at that time... in fact, two members were sent to Florida as delegates of the board at a national education conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.924" offset="1465461">Now, as a result of the action of the board in terminating the petitioner, she filed suit in the Common Pleas Court of Trumbull County, Ohio, and in that suit she challenged the validity of the board's action in terminating her, and her complaint in essence set forth a breach of contract, and the second count, or second cause of action, a tort action in the nature of a conspiracy to violate her contract of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.892" offset="1629405">The trial judge held trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.935" offset="1657513">It was a bench trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.062" offset="1662006">At the trial time he upon his own motion reserved and continued the tort action, the second cause of action, and held trial only on the narrow issue as to whether or not the board, respondent board acted in conformity with the state law as to its non-renewal or termination of the... of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.409" offset="1763466">The court then rendered its judgment, found that the petitioner had a binding contract with the school board, that the school board breached the contract, and therefore granted damages to the petitioner in the amount of the salary she lost for the year and ordered her reinstated to her position, but inasmuch as the decision was rendered on March the 20th, and her contract expired in June, she never entered into her position again for one reason or another.</text>

            <text syncTime="462.092" offset="1982163">Oh, no question about it, under concurrent jurisdiction, and Congress has granted to the states concurrent jurisdiction to entertain a civil rights, and the civil rights suitor, plaintiff obviously had a choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="493.455" offset="2107655">--Well, I take the position, we take the position that the Congressional intent in granting plaintiffs... a civil rights plaintiff the choice to go to federal court or the state court, we believe that that grant by Congress is unconditional.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.474" offset="2207652">I think as we understand the intent the Congress intended to allow the suitor to determine whether he feels comfortable in the state court, for whatever reason, for local prejudice problems, and go to federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="539.871" offset="2293229">Well, I believe that if... although in our case here, we will argue that Ohio res judicata would not preclude, but I would say that... I would say that if there were a state law to that effect, which I would construe as making it mandatory, taking away this free choice of which court to go to, and making it mandatory, I would say that that law or that policy would clearly contravene this Congrsessional intent of allowing you, a civil rights plaintiff, to choose without explanation.</text>

            <text syncTime="585.823" offset="2477131">Well, Allen versus McCurry dealt only with collateral estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.538" offset="2503985">Now, I say if a... as I understand Allen versus McCurry, I say if a civil rights plaintiff voluntarily presents his claims to a state court or presents some issue that is material or relevant to the determination of a civil rights action, then he certainly has waived it or has foregone the right, or if he is confronted with collateral estoppel, I agree, he should not relitigate an important material issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="620.200" offset="2614640">Well, Allen against McCurry and, I think, Herring against Proceze last year, too, involved... the original state adjudication was a criminal one, wasn't it, where certainly the appearance of the defendant couldn't be called voluntary.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.116" offset="2666258">Well, it is not voluntary, except in Herring, I think, I think there was a strong motivation for Herring... or to say in Herring, if you follow that, adopt that rule, there was a strong motivation to say in Herring, here, I am faced with a criminal conviction that is going to go on my record, and I have a constitutional defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.747" offset="2760821">I have a constitutional defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.244" offset="2766777">I am going to raise that defense rather than risk being convicted or... and having a criminal record, or rather than risk this voluntarily pleading guilty, and I think... but I think the principle is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.099" offset="2822156">I think as Justice Marshall said, that they argued... the petitioners in that case argued like our respondents are arguing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.599" offset="2852145">They say if the civil rights plaintiff had an opportunity to litigate, to raise, to litigate and decide, then they should be barred and precluded from filing a subsequent civil action, and Justice Marshall said, if we adopt such a rule, it would be anomalous.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.698" offset="2928632">And then Justice Marshall also goes into running afoul of this clear and established Congressional intent, of this grave concern of Congress that a civil rights suitor should have the selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.132" offset="2982339">His very valuable civil rights should be, if he chooses, should be considered by a federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="754.192" offset="3150568">"A deprivation of a constitutional right is significantly different from and more serious than a violation of state right, and therefore deserves a different remedy, even though the same act may constitute a state tort and the deprivation of a constitutional right. "</text>
            <text syncTime="772.122" offset="3222248">And in Ohio, incidentally, under the... not incidentally, it is an important aspect of our case... the tort, the second count or second cause of action in the complaint in the state action was a tort action in the nature of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.352" offset="3287241">When the trial judge dismissed that cause of action and... that is, reserved... dismissed it, he dismissed it without prejudice, and the language of "without prejudice" in Ohio means that that is to be construed as an adjudication not on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="844.454" offset="3511580">Judge Manos did not consider the legal aspects or legal consequences of a voluntary dismissal without prejudice, and in Ohio that is clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="854.121" offset="3550241">And I think one of the first and most important elements of traditional res judicata is that you must have a determination on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction, and if you don't have... and of course, of course, the... in Ohio there is no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.177" offset="3610532">That's why we brought it in federal court under, under that situation, where a matter is voluntarily dismissed, you can immediately turn around and refile it the next day.</text>

            <text syncTime="996.874" offset="4121278">Well, as I read Judge Manos's opinion, Judge Manos... and he cited another Sixth Circuit opinion... he just was... took the position that since state courts can entertain constitutional, full constitutional issues, that there is no reason why he should litigate them there, and since they can, you are barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.832" offset="4225141">It is simple as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.519" offset="4227858">Now, the Coogan case, I mean, there are many areas, and sometimes you have to make a fine distinction where the courts confuse collateral estoppel with res judicata, and there are many areas, and in most cases, as I read them, what really happens is, the plaintiff in the subsequent action or the civil rights plaintiff, he is a disgruntled party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.994" offset="4313748">He lost in the first instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.198" offset="4330571">And if you analyze it closely, what he is really trying to do, he wants to relitigate the issues that he lost on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.834" offset="4357112">Now, I believe in that situation, if you adopt Allen versus McCurry, he runs into collateral estoppel, and so he lost on the state level, he says, now I am going to frame the same issue on a constitutional basis and see if I can't get the state court to be more sympathetic, and that is Coogan, too, and I have no quarrel with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.966" offset="4441644">I have no quarrel with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.899" offset="5689356">We understand that he is thinking about future election, and that's the realities of life, and if he can avoid antagonizing anybody, and we have no idea how widespread the opposition... we know that the respondents were vehement in their opposition, but we do not know... it may very well involve other prominent citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.253" offset="5774829">We do know that the state court judge had some... had some papers that respondent Swan had gathered, and we have a companion related case in the district court, and we felt perhaps those papers may reveal some information or some relevant evidence or may lead us to, give us information, and we have waited two and a half years to have a determination as to whether or not we can have discovery with those papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.024" offset="5877856">So, there are circumstances here, I think, that could reasonably construe from what is in the record that it would not be wise to go back to a court in that community, and fortunately, the wisdom of Congress said, you have a selection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1596.987" offset="6521722">Mr. Chief Justice, and Justices of the United States Supreme Court, the issue before this Court is whether or not a state court petitioner who claims that she has had her contract rights violated and files a law suit in state court to get her job back, and also alleges conspiracy among the board members to deprive her of her job, that once having tried that lawsuit, can then embark upon a second lawsuit in federal court alleging essentially the same facts, the came causes of action, but tacking onto it a First Amendment or 1983 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.501" offset="6671770">Both the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals felt that she should not, and that the preclusive effect of res judicata barred the second lawsuit that was filed in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.637" offset="6728299">The U.S. District Court in Ohio applied 1738, the full faith and credit clause, which essentially requires that federal courts give preclusive effect to state court judgments if in fact they would be a bar in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.225" offset="6794650">We believe that both lower federal courts were right, and that this Court should affirm the opinions below.</text>
