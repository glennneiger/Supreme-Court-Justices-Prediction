            <text syncTime="5.069" offset="123817">The first one is Solem against Bartlett, 82-1253.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.954" offset="151298">This case is before us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.378" offset="180973">The question presented is whether an Act of Congress passed in 1908 diminished the boundaries of the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation, which is located in North and South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.090" offset="243876">In two recent opinions, the South Dakota Supreme Court has ruled that the 1908 Act did diminish the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.884" offset="283059">However, in this case, the Eighth Circuit ruled that the Act did not alter reservation boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.055" offset="311690">We grant the certiorari to resolve this conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.855" offset="330916">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.889" offset="359024">As we upheld in the past, an Act of Congress or the circumstances of the Act's passage must clearly demonstrate a congressional purpose to reduce the size of an Indian reservation before we will find that the legislation diminished Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.923" offset="443138">In the absence of such a clear demonstration, we assumed that Congress could not intend to change reservation boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.994" offset="483471">The Act of May 29, 1908 does not unambiguously demonstrate the Congressman to diminish the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation nor do the events surrounding the passage of the 1908 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.200" offset="548255">We therefore agree with the Eighth Circuit that the 1908 Act did not diminish the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation and the judgment of the Eighth Circuit is affirmed.</text>
