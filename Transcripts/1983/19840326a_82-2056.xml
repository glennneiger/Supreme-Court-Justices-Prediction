            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="146831">We will hear arguments first this morning in Escondido Mutual Water Company against LaJolla.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.141" offset="203360">Mr. Engstrand, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_engstrand" startTime="19.186" stopTime="699.852">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Engstrand</label>
            <text syncTime="19.186" offset="223527">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, it is an honor today for us to share our time with Solicitor Feit of the Commission, who will explain why Section 4(e) of the Federal Power Act does not give the Secretaries authority to veto licensing decisions of the Commission by imposing unreasonable conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.515" offset="348810">I shall background the case and explain why the Indian bands have not been given the right by Congress to veto licensing decisions of the Commission, and I shall discuss why water rights are not similar to reservation lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.960" offset="434596">In southern California, between Los Angeles and San Diego, at Oceanside, the San Luis Rey River empties a 565-square mile watershed into the Pacific Ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.742" offset="513799">In 1895, western movement pioneers constructed an intake in a deep canyon in the LaJolla Reservation and a canal over precipitous mountain terrain to Lake Woford near Escondido.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.688" offset="605541">In 1915, they added a power plant at Bear Valley, and in 1916, a power plant at the Rincon site.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.756" offset="657786">The canal and its works traverses three Indian reservations and occupies a tiny fraction, less than 1 percent of those reservation lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.137" offset="715360">The project... In 1922 Henshaw Dam was constructed, and later the canal was enlarged in order to convey the water stored by the dam as well as the natural flow of the river above the intake and below the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.172" offset="815461">These physical works were constructed by reason of legal arrangements made with the bands and the Secretary of the Interior on their behalf by contracts made in 1894, 1914, and 1922, a permit from the Secretary of the Interior in 1908, and a Federal Power Commission license in 1924.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.181" offset="931549">Prior to 1969-1970, the bands or Interior made no objection to these works except by the filing of a claim before the Indian Claims Commission which was opposed by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.930" offset="1042518">In 1971, Escondido sought relicensing, and at that time the bands sought to revoke our license, sought a non-power license for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.419" offset="1100405">Interior fully support the bands' position and even recommended that the United States recapture.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.077" offset="1143037">In accordance with their authority under Section E, they sought to impose conditions which would have molded the project into a non-power contract not best adapted for development of the river as found by the Commission, but in the words of the Administrative Law Judge, to destroy the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.344" offset="1248153">Interior candidly admits that it is not acting in the scope of its role in the best interests of the United States, but that it is totally blinded by its role as a guardian for the bands.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.336" offset="1324118">The project and its works are small, on average 14,500 acre feet of water and four million kilowatt hours of power produced, but in this semi-arid region, the water is important and the power in these energy-short times is consequential.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.079" offset="1415128">The Commission in 1979 in two orders granted a license jointly to Escondido and Vista.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.050" offset="1471030">Petitions for review were heard by the Ninth Circuit, who reversed and remanded, and in October you granted cert. There is no rational basis for the benefits of Project 176 to be taken away from the 110,000 citizens of Escondido and Vista.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.947" offset="1574580">The bands bottom their contentions in notions about tribal sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.572" offset="1601015">But this is a false bottom, because we all recognize the plenary power of Congress over these tribal lands, and we know that Congress in the public interest has long determined that tribal bands' lands are frequently necessary for use by non-tribal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.767" offset="1697878">Congress has provided for railroads, tramways, canals, reservoirs, electric lines, hot water power projects to use tribal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.254" offset="1747824">We know that the broad plan and purpose of Congress in the Federal Power Act was to centralize and provide for the development of the water power resources of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.027" offset="1814906">We know that under the Act of March 3rd, 1891, the general right-of-way statute, Congress provided for the use of tribal lands to encourage the western development.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.467" offset="1872689">We know that under the Mission Indian Relief Act, MIRA, Congress provided that canal companies and citizens could use tribal lands for canal right-of-ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.086" offset="1931099">The conflict here before Your Honors is, who did Congress designate as the final decision-maker about these tribal lands?</text>
            <text syncTime="456.492" offset="1972790">I do not choose to forsake the many amici who have appeared on our behalf before Your Honors by focusing on tribal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.069" offset="2011033">The result would be the same if we were dealing with any other reservations, for if the Commission is not the final arbiter, the final decision-maker, then we will have to return to the same processes that were followed before the turn of the century, when special bills had to be introduced for the development of water power projects and use of tribal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.294" offset="2108000">The first hydro plant was built in 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.055" offset="2123047">We all know the Congressional struggle that eventuated in the 1920 Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.739" offset="2145721">In Tuscarora, this Court noted that the Congress did not overlook, did not exclude, but specifically dealt with the tribal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.697" offset="2193577">The question: Who should be the final arbiter?</text>
            <text syncTime="517.283" offset="2215938">The Congress provided in Section 3(2) that tribal lands were to be covered by water power development.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.447" offset="2248539">Section 4(e) gave to the Commission the authority to license project works on tribal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.133" offset="2283334">We know that the Senate amendment specifically was rejected by Congress, which would have given Indians tribal consent necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.922" offset="2334429">The Congress also followed the traditional safeguards for Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.545" offset="2356999">In Section 4(e) there is a requirement of the non-interference finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.707" offset="2373613">In Section 10(e) there is a requirement that reasonable compensation be paid for the use of tribal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.782" offset="2401930">In Section 10(i), where the Commission is given authority to waive conditions for other projects, they cannot do that over tribal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.448" offset="2436620">And we know that under Section 17(a) they provided that proceeds from the compensation for the use of tribal lands is assigned to the tribes involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.255" offset="2475804">It is difficult to conceive how the drafters of Congressional will could be more specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.258" offset="2503807">As Judge Leventhal in the Montana Power case said, Congress was aware of the conflict of the Secretary of Interior between the landowners of the tribal lands and the interests of licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.008" offset="2562844">The Commission was meant to be the arbiter of the general interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.013" offset="2582802">If the Commission is not... decisions are not final, Congress's whole plan will be frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.056" offset="2611014">It will be like an orchestra without strings, like a baseball team without a pitcher.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.310" offset="2635987">Tribal consent would be destructive and not helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.143" offset="2651347">MIRA in 1891 provided for the use of tribal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.386" offset="2672349">It provided in 1891 that the consent of the tribal bands were necessary, and the approval of the Secretary of Interior, but three months later, in the general right-of-way statute of March, 1891, the Congress provided that right-of-ways could be given with only the requirement from the Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.642" offset="2773391">In 1898, the Secretary of Interior interpreted this to apply to tribal lands, and the Ninth Circuit in 1914 approved this interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.442" offset="2832532">Ever since 1898, under the Act of 1891, and under the 1920 Power Act, the administrative officials charged with the responsibility to enforce these Acts have consistently interpreted the provisions as applying to tribal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.616" offset="2917273">And, Your Honors, I choose to reserve five minutes, if I may, for closing.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="699.852" stopTime="712.468">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="699.852" offset="2946217">Mr. Feit.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerome_m_feit" startTime="712.468" stopTime="1004.110">
            <label>Mr. Jerome M. Feit</label>
            <text syncTime="712.468" offset="2996686">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as has been stated, this case involves the reach and scope of the proviso, the licensing proviso in Section 4(e) of the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.536" offset="3044960">Of principal concern to the Commission today is the context involving the distribution of authority under that proviso between FERC and Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.213" offset="3091667">The proviso is set out at Pages 2 and 3 of our main opening brief, and requires that before issuing a license over reservation lands, the Commission must find that the license, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="752.075" offset="3155092">"will not interfere or be inconsistent with the purpose for which such reservation was created or required, and should be subject to and contain such conditions as the Secretary of the department under whose supervision such reservation falls shall be deemed necessary for the adequate protection and utilization of such reservation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="773.140" offset="3239311">The majority of the Court of Appeals below, purporting to rely on, and we believe erroneously, on the plain language test, held that the Commission may not alter those conditions in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.824" offset="3282047">If the Commission is of the view that the terms are inappropriate or improper for the license it wishes, it may simply not issue the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.861" offset="3314230">The court further held that this conclusion did not grant the Secretary 313 of the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.952" offset="3374625">It is our view that the position of Interior and the court below seriously misapprehends the intent underlying the Section 4(e) proviso and undercuts in that regard the thrust and purpose of the Act, the licensing thrust.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.640" offset="3437319">Surely at most times there is no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.432" offset="3448500">Both provisions work together.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.783" offset="3457904">The Commission protects the physical homeland, and that is what the inconsistency and interference finding is all about, the security of the physical land, the population, the number of homes in the area, the overall impact on the reservation qua a place for Indians to live.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.496" offset="3528748">The Secretary, on the other hand, in our view has a lesser but... not a lesser in importance, certainly, but lesser in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.210" offset="3563647">He must see to it that the project works, the project works be not so placed which would interfere with the health, safety, recreation, water flow, access roads, all of those things to protect the reservation and see that the works are properly utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.818" offset="3658002">But beyond this, and there is an inherent tension between the two provisos, the interference, inconsistency proviso and the protection proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.366" offset="3712232">The tension arises because in a sense they both work with another.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.677" offset="3729473">That is, the Secretary supports the absolutist theory, saying that the conditioning power has no bearing on the interference, inconsistency authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.785" offset="3769910">The two functions are separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.618" offset="3777224">That is not true as we read those two provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.738" offset="3789763">One may well be at war with the other, and it seems to us the protection provision may try to take over the interference, inconsistency provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.115" offset="3823200">Two examples suffice, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.036" offset="3830932">The Pidgeon River case, which is an old administrative case in which Secretary Ickes wished that a dam not be built on an Indian reservation, and he submitted evidence in support of the view that the inference, inconsistency determination should be exercised by the Commission in a way against issuance of a license, but he said in any event I am going to submit conditions which will not permit the dam to be built at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.964" offset="3938661">This case, I think, also further illustrates where the Secretary seeks to impose upon the authority, the inconsistency, interference authority of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.739" offset="3981711">What has happened here is, Proviso 4, for example... excuse me, Condition 4 submitted by the Secretary would require the Commission to recognize the reserved water rights of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.118" offset="4031239">Well, the water rights issue is essentially not our business in terms of defining rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.131" offset="4051301">That question is now in the Federal District Court, where it has been since 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.094" offset="4075125">We have an open-ended condition in the license which provides that the ultimate resolution of that issue by the District Court will ultimately inform the license that we issue, so it is hard for us to perceive how this case involved a proper invocation of a power by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.209" offset="4159657">Let me just turn--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1004.110" offset="4163210">Mr. Feit, what effect would such a recognition have on the water rights litigation that is pending in the District Court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerome_m_feit" startTime="1012.536" stopTime="1445.357">
            <label>Mr. Jerome M. Feit</label>
            <text syncTime="1012.536" offset="4196960">--A recognition of the reserve interest rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.987" offset="4206678">I don't think anything in that sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.588" offset="4225172">I think that our statute precludes us from making such a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.643" offset="4249309">It would be ultra viries of our authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.615" offset="4261221">To that extent, I think the District Court opinion would be the one that is cold sway in the day, that is, that courts make that determination, and this Commission, if it tried to do so, it seems to me, would be exercising absolute power that it just doesn't have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.937" offset="4334573">I would like to turn to the legislative history which I think supports our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.051" offset="4350978">First of all, I want to point out there is an error at Page 5 of our second supplemental brief in which we attribute to Congressman... excuse me, to Senator Walsh a statement made by Congressman Walsh in an effort to distinguish Senator Walsh's apparent approval of the veto authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.104" offset="4435197">That is an unfortunate error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.354" offset="4440212">I am sorry for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.155" offset="4443451">But in any event it seems to us that Senator Walsh's statement is not all that persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.680" offset="4469469">It was made in terms of a discussion with regard to the appropriateness of giving the Indians the authority to stop a project and the Senator was responding to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.430" offset="4528506">Also, Congressman Walsh, the statement we attribute to the Senate, did make that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.963" offset="4550658">He made it to Congressman Rayka, who in fact was the House proponent of the Administration's bill and made clear that he thought one vote could not terminate a project with two votes on the Commission, which was then comprised of the three Secretaries, War, Agriculture, Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.407" offset="4640415">There are statements in the Secretary's brief regarding the notion in the debate for the '20 Act indicating that there was the view that a Secretary could veto it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.575" offset="4689107">On the other hand, we think the evidence of legislative intent is spelled out more in our favor by other remarks which we have adduced in our brief, and it seems to us that this one aspect, this aspect, we think, as our brief points out, we have the better of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.867" offset="4762250">The one area of the legislative history which is not referred to at all in the Secretary's brief, it seems to us, is that the legislative history focuses again on no water control, no water control by the Commission, a focus on property rights, property rights, not broad interests, Indian concerns in the broadest sovereignty sense, and I think one illustration again here is good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.946" offset="4878547">The legislative history stems from the rights-of-way statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.829" offset="4894116">It is clear that the 1920 Act took those rights-of-way statutes as their base, developed on them, built on them, provided for them in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.604" offset="4933195">At that time, under those rights-of-way statutes, the particular Secretary had control over what we call now the interference, inconsistency finding within those particular statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.733" offset="4981678">He also had the conditioning authority, but the conditioning authority, of course, was not meant to overcome the broad licensing authority that that rights-of-way statute provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.209" offset="5027654">On the contrary, it was to be exercised reasonably, and that is all we say here, that when Congress enacted the 1920 Act, what was a single power in each of the Secretaries under the statutes they enforced became bifurcated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.711" offset="5085646">The Commission was given the licensing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.131" offset="5099334">The Secretary was to retain the conditioning power, the impact of the project works on the reservation, that power to be exercised with reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.628" offset="5137264">The Secretary says, however, yes, we agree with the reasonableness approach to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.203" offset="5163595">However, that is a matter for the Court of Appeals to deal with, and all the Commission has to do is simply include the Secretary's condition, and if it is unreasonable or arbitrary, the Court of Appeals will remedy the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.791" offset="5217930">We don't think this really answers the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.344" offset="5232140">In our view, it turns the review statutes on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.466" offset="5252620">Section 313 of the Power Act, A and B, deals with review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.941" offset="5278534">The court... I might say the court below realized the difficulty of using 313.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.006" offset="5302775">Initially on the opinion it relied upon the APA saying the Secretary's condition will be reviewed under the APA, the Commission's under the Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.331" offset="5336108">On rehearing, the court retreated, saying, well... recognizing that under this Court's decision in the City of Takoma case that the review provisions of Section 313 are absolute, unconditional, and all issues must be resolved therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.091" offset="5399115">Let me illustrate the problems of such a review provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.483" offset="5412699">Under 313(a), the Commission in its own judgment may take a case back before a record is filed from a Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.761" offset="5453868">What do we do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.411" offset="5456375">Does Interior... We obviously can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.052" offset="5467033">The Commission may change its rule on rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.494" offset="5480722">We have a statute which requires a rehearing requirement after the issuance of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.838" offset="5502142">The Commission... the language is absolute in the statutory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.750" offset="5513740">Obviously we can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.942" offset="5522518">We have an obligation under the statute to establish a record evidence, substantial evidence test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.176" offset="5551461">The Secretary's conditioning authority, if it is unalterable, imposes no requirement of a hearing or a discussion of any sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.831" offset="5578106">How do we determine that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.461" offset="5584584">We have the obligation to enforce our orders as well as our statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.356" offset="5612170">How do we do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.869" offset="5618230">The Secretary says, well, the third party may raise the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.009" offset="5630769">The third party doesn't represent the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.162" offset="5639442">The Commission does, and the Commission is, it seems to us, in a bifurcated, unreal position, a distortion of the statutory terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.889" offset="5678312">In sum, it is our position that the licensing authority of the Commission is the central power to weigh and balance those interests which the Congress in its wisdom gave the Commission to decide in determining whether to issue a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.737" offset="5749678">The Commission is obligated under statutory terms to make a determination that the license is not inconsistent with nor does it interfere with the purpose for which the reservation was created or acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.758" offset="5809760">That is the central power of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.530" offset="5820940">The Secretary, it seems to us, has the lesser power, which we normally give great deference to, and the problem rarely arises to make such conditions which relate to the way the project works impact on the reservation, and it seems to us that that kind of decision-making resting with the Commission, at that time, the Secretary having made a record the other way, can seek review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1571.669" offset="6433460">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to begin my remarks by focusing on the reservation proviso of Section 4(e) of the Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.797" offset="6481943">The language of that proviso clearly shows in our view that Congress sought to ensure that reservations would be protected from the adverse effects of power development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.334" offset="6528127">It is only after considering the import of the Section 4(e) proviso that the legal issues presented here can be properly addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.162" offset="6563445">It is the Secretary's position here that the statute, Section 4(e), means exactly what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.977" offset="6602733">The statute provides that licenses may be issued for projects on reservations, but only if the Commission make a finding that the license will not interfere or be inconsistent with the purposes for which the reservation was created, but also licenses are specifically made to be subject to and to contain such conditions as the Secretary of the department under whose supervision the reservation falls shall deem necessary for the adequate protection and utilization of the reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1673.226" offset="6839716">How does it work in light of Section 313?</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.298" offset="6851941">It is very unclear to me how you think the issue would be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.591" offset="6873153">Does it go to the Commission in the first place, the Power Commission in the first place to decide?</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.108" offset="6903246">And how is the judicial review triggered?</text>

            <text syncTime="1691.318" offset="6912023">The issue could not go to the Commission to decide, because that would negate the clear intent of Section 4(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.724" offset="6949639">Section 4(e), which is the substantive grant of authority that is before the Court in this case clearly provides that it is the Secretary who shall determine which conditions should be included within the license, so it makes no sense to say that the Secretary can merely recommend conditions to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.009" offset="7034798">That would read the second part of the reservation proviso out of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.711" offset="7053607">Now, it is true that the Commission and the petitioners have argued that this would create some problems for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.846" offset="7086207">There are several responses that I have to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.567" offset="7097074">First of all, it seems to me that this would be a case of the tail wagging the dog.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.163" offset="7119435">I mean, it is the substantive provision in 4(e) that gives the Secretary the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.805" offset="7138034">If there are any difficulties, and I don't concede that there are in terms of reviewing the Secretary's condition, it seems to me that the accommodation should be made on the judicial review end of the spectrum rather than cutting back the Secretary's authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1833.611" offset="7481179">In other words, the Secretary must show that the conditions that he prescribes are reasonably related to the purpose of ensuring that the purposes of the reservation are adequately protected, and that the reservation is adequately utilized.</text>

            <text syncTime="1911.380" offset="7792349">That is one way in which the parties would have an opportunity at the administrative level to make their views known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.586" offset="7821084">Second, in the course of presenting evidence to the Commission on other aspects of the license, the parties would be, certainly with respect to the interference, inconsistency finding, would present evidence that would be relevant to the Secretary in his determination of whether the conditions that he proposes to include are proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.711" offset="7913662">In fact, in this case the Secretary modified the initial conditions in order to take into account the evidence that had been brought out before the Administrative Law Judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2755.804" offset="11169982">So, as the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held in the Lac Courte Creilles case, which is cited in the briefs, the whole concept of relicensing was that it would be a new proceeding, and it would take place under the terms of existing laws, and this Court... this Court's only decision dealing with this relicensing question was United States against Appalachian Electric Power Company in 311 USC 76, where the Court specifically referred to the relicensing provisions and upheld their constitutionality against the claim that they would constitute an unlawful taking of land without providing just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.595" offset="11361198">Justice O'Connor, the Secretary's conditions would not be an adjudication of water rights by the back door.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.203" offset="11407592">The whole point of the Secretary's conditions is to set forth that which would be necessary to provide for the adequate protection and utilization of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.280" offset="11451895">Those conditions can be considered as if one assumed that there were no water rights of the reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.755" offset="11477809">The Secretary is simply saying, this is what is necessary to protect those reservations and to ensure their adequate utilization.</text>

            <text syncTime="2861.473" offset="11592643">Now, the petitioners are seeking here to enter three Indian reservations to gain use and control of Indian lands without obtaining the Indians' consent for the purpose of diverting water away from six reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.753" offset="11653770">The reason that they are invoking the Federal Power Act, despite the fact that the hydroelectric aspects of this project are incidental and de minimis, is that without a license from the Commission, they would be required to bargain with the bands and the Secretary of the Interior for the use of reservation lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.675" offset="11725450">So, they are attempting to use the Power Act to circumvent or avoid the requirements of other laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.459" offset="11756588">This is doubly ironic because in the first place the power aspects of the projects are, as I indicated, so small and incidental, and secondly because the Power Act so explicitly ensures that the interests of Indians as well as other federal reservations will not be sacrificed to the development of hydroelectric power.</text>

            <text syncTime="3394.085" offset="13723086">This proviso, as the Court of Appeals pointed out, would be totally meaningless if Congress intended to sanction the abrogation of the rights and powers guaranteed to Indian tribes by preexisting treaties and statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3420.761" offset="13829874">--That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.021" offset="13834890">There is dual protection, dual safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.083" offset="13847115">The petitioners' other argument on the Mission Indian Belief Act is that Section 8 in the Federal Power Act should be viewed as alternate mechanisms for obtaining canal rights of way across Mission reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.350" offset="13892150">That makes no sense whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.664" offset="13901450">The one point on which all parties in this case are agreed is that the use of Indian lands for a power project, and this is assumedly a power project, requires a Commission license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.360" offset="13944186">Now, it may also require Indian consent, and that is the issue, but it certainly requires a Commission license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.654" offset="13969368">So since a Commission license would be required and necessary in any event, obtaining the consent of the Indians on the Secretary of the Interior under Section 8 is not a true alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.043" offset="14019001">It would be entirely superfluous and unnecessary, because it would never be utilized if the Commission's license had to be obtained in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.989" offset="14054736">By contrast, requiring, as both the bands and the Secretary contend, requiring both a Commission license as well as compliance with Section 8 of the Mission Indian Relief Act gives effect to both statutes while preserving their overall sense and purpose, and does not subordinate one to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.781" offset="14133940">On the definition of reservations, I agree with Mr. Schulder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.716" offset="14161629">The ambiguity that is created here is that water rights are expressly concluded, and there is no doubt about that, within the Act's definition of reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.892" offset="14198305">That much is clear and unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.614" offset="14209277">The ambiguity arises because the reservation proviso applies to licenses within a reservation, and the question is, how can a license be within a water right?</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.432" offset="14256506">That doesn't really make sense, and so that is a real true to life ambiguity, and our contention is that that ambiguity has to be resolved in favor of the downstream reservations for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.280" offset="14311886">First and foremost is that that interpretation carries out and furthers the evident protective purpose toward reservations in the Federal Power Act, both in the reservation proviso itself as well as in the broad definition of reservation in the Act, and secondly, as Mr. Schulder pointed out, because of the provision in Section 23(b) that indicates that the word 4(e), and thirdly, because Section 10(e) of the Act expressly uses the term</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.576" offset="14473113">"tribal lands embraced within Indian reservations. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.687" offset="14485548">in defining when manual charges are to be fixed by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.842" offset="14510103">So, when Congress wanted to limit the term 10(e).</text>

            <text syncTime="3609.685" offset="14585544">Your Honor, if I may on this question of water rights, the reason the land needs to be protected is because of a physical imposition on the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.160" offset="14619399">The reason water rights need not be protected is because the courts protect the water rights, and the Congress said in Section 27 that nothing in the Federal Power Act would interfere with the water rights given by the states for the control and use of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.652" offset="14689407">This complex arrangement that Mr. Schulder talked about, of course, Congress didn't lay that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.376" offset="14712291">Where would the fact-finder be that you were going to weigh the substantial evidence rule against if you don't read "reasonable" in front of the word "shall".</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.666" offset="14765476">And I think that is what Justice McKinnon said in Lac Courte Oreilles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.997" offset="14782717">He said that you must... probably he was saving that until later.</text>
