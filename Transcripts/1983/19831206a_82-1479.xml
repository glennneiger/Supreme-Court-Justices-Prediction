            <text syncTime="85.872" offset="493117">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Justices of the Boston Municipal Court seek reversal of an order and judgment of the First Circuit Court of Appeals which granted pretrial habeas corpus relief to a state defendant freed upon personal recognizance pending a de novo trial which he had requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.083" offset="573888">The Court of Appeals found that the evidence introduced at the initial bench trial was insufficient to support conviction, and therefore held that the double jeopardy clause precluded the de novo trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.843" offset="624983">The court ordered that Mr. Lydon be freed from the personal recognizance he was on, that he not be required to answer any summons for trial, and effectively precluded or enjoined the Commonwealth from providing the de novo trial which he had requested.</text>

            <text syncTime="155.333" offset="770955">If dissatisfied with the result of that bench trial, his sole remedy is a de novo trial before a six-man jury or a judge and the jury session if he so decides.</text>

            <text syncTime="545.564" offset="2331824">The Supreme Judicial Court, finding no constitutional requirement that such form of review be granted, declined to extend Burks to the instant situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="559.224" offset="2386472">Mr. Lydon then sought certiorari from this Court which was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.093" offset="2401937">He then proceeded to file a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Federal District Court, alleging that the de novo trial would violate his double jeopardy rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.032" offset="2437777">The District Court denied respondent's motion to dismiss, and found that it had jurisdiction, that Lydon was in sufficient custody for federal habeas corpus purposes, that it had the authority under Jackson versus Virginia to rule upon the sufficiency of the evidence, which it did, and found it to be insufficient, and then, applying Burks, ordered that the writ be granted, and further ordered that Mr. Lydon be released from personal recognizance, and that the Commonwealth not retry him in the jury session.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.503" offset="2563582">The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.586" offset="2571941">Our appeal to this Court centers on three fundamental propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.990" offset="2593571">First, that release upon personal recognizance without surety prior to trial when one does not stand under conviction and sentence does not constitute a sufficient restraint upon one's personal liberty to constitute custody within the meaning of the habeas corpus statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.987" offset="2673506">Neither Hensley nor the Jones case relied upon by the First Circuit require a different conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.807" offset="2700882">Second, we will argue that even were the federal court within its jurisdiction, exercise of that jurisdiction prior to trial where the petitioner is not under conviction is inappropriate and violates principles of comity and federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.901" offset="2757202">Third, we would argue that the Massachusetts system based upon a defendant's totally voluntary initial choice of the trial procedures he wishes to pursue does not implicate the whole jeopardy considerations made manifest in Burks, nor is the Commonwealth constitutionally required to provide appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.230" offset="2838495">As I have indicated previously, the restraints imposed by the conditions of personal recognizance are minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.686" offset="2872350">The cases relied upon by the court below do not support a finding of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.472" offset="2891471">In Hensley, the petitioner had been convicted and sentenced to a period of incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.311" offset="2918848">Only execution of sentence had been stayed pending appeal, and the petitioner released on personal recognizance.</text>

            <text syncTime="930.729" offset="3872526">As I indicated before, in Hensley, the Court focused on the fact that incarceration was certain when it found that he was in sufficient custody for habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.472" offset="3927488">Here, incarceration is only a possibility contingent upon a finding of guilt by the jury, and a further determination by the jury trial judge that the individual should be incarcerated and not merely subjected to a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.148" offset="3986211">Moreover, unlike the situation in Hensley, the federal court's finding of custody in this situation does very seriously interfere with the Commonwealth's significant interest in the efficient operation of its two-tier system.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.222" offset="4042531">Under this decision, yet a federal third and fourth tier have been created before the Commonwealth can conclude the proceedings in these relatively minor though numerous offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.918" offset="4105329">Nor does Lydon face any of the restrictions upon his liberty placed upon one released on parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.671" offset="4136258">His movements are not restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.273" offset="4142737">He is not required, as in Jones versus Cunningham, to live or work in a particular place or perform a particular job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.593" offset="4171994">His continued liberty, unlike Jones again, is not placed in the hands of the lay members of a parole board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.449" offset="4199370">Any revocation of his recognizance could only follow a judicial determination that he had violated some condition of that recognizance, and even then, such a determination need not require his incarceration, but merely an increase in terms of the recognizance or the addition of a surety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.495" offset="4271572">If this court, I would suggest, holds that personal recognizance prior to a de novo trial is sufficient to involve the federal court in a state criminal proceeding, it in effect establishes that federal court as a court of interlocutory appeal over pretrial... denial of pretrial motions in a state criminal proceeding, and this is a situation, I suggest, never contemplated by the Constitution nor Congress in enacting the habeas corpus statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.030" offset="4397692">Here, Lydon has been granted pretrial review by a federal court over a denial of a motion for directed verdict of acquittal, rendering the situation, I submit, even more egregious because interlocutory review of such motions are not permitted by a number of the circuits within the unitary federal system itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.212" offset="4482433">For example, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Ninth, and the District of Columbia Circuits do not permit appeal of a denial of a motion, a defendant's motion for directed verdict of acquittal based upon the insufficiency of the evidence following a mistrial, and this is so even though there, as here, the defendant attempts to couch his claim in terms of double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.876" offset="4573130">To permit such collateral review of a state court proceeding far exceeds, I suggest, what is permitted within the federal system itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.831" offset="4608970">Now, I am aware that this Court has granted certiorari to review the District of Columbia decision in the Richardson case, but I would suggest that even were this Court to find such interlocutory review permissible within the federal system, that would not control this case, because principles of comity and federalism would have to be addressed, I believe, before the Court could order such review over a state criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.584" offset="4723909">Moreover, a decision permitting interlocutory review in the federal system based on the nature of the claim presented would, I suggest, have no logical effect on a determination of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.443" offset="4779393">The court, the federal court relied upon Jackson versus Virginia for its authority to review a claim that a state court conviction rests upon insufficient evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.270" offset="4838639">I will not belabor the obvious distinction between Jackson and the instant case, namely, that Jackson was in custody pursuant to the conviction he attacked under Section 2254 of the habeas corpus statute, while Lydon is in custody only upon a pretrial recognizance, having as a matter of state law vacated the prior conviction by claim of de novo trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.485" offset="4939576">Jackson does not require or authorize the federal court to review a claim of insufficient evidence when a defendant does not stand under conviction based upon that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.693" offset="4984402">In Jackson, this Court merely defined the standard of review to be applied in a Section 2254 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.566" offset="5015853">It did not enlarge habeas corpus jurisdiction to permit the federal court to review the sufficiency of the evidence at a trial in which the verdict and sentence have been set aside prior to the petitioner ever arriving in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.076" offset="5073950">The Federal District Court itself acknowledged in the last sentence of its order that the petitioner was no longer subject to verdict or sentence of the bench trial judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2342.840" offset="9520931">In answering your question, Justice Marshall, about what a lawyer would have told Michael Lydon, I believe it appropriate to ask the Court to consider what advice it would have wanted a competent defense attorney to give Michael Lydon when he had to make that election to participate in the de novo system or not in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.586" offset="9604000">Burks, Your Honor, had been decided a little bit over a year ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.205" offset="9618420">There had been no decision by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts saying whether Burks applied to the de novo system or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.692" offset="9648408">However, although there was no opinion by the highest court in Massachusetts, there was every indication elsewhere in the Massachusetts system that Burks in fact did apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.250" offset="9694593">In particular, there were three opinions by trial judges in the second tier of the de novo system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.523" offset="9723746">Each of those three opinions said, yes, the Burks interpretation of the double jeopardy clause applies to the de novo system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.895" offset="9765228">In addition, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts had decided in 1978 a case, and it is cited in the amicus brief, Your Honor, at Page 12, Costarelli versus Commonwealth, in which the Supreme Judicial Court said that an individual who goes on trial in the first tier of the system and faces a judge who, when hearing insufficient evidence, dismisses the case and then orders a prosecutor to bring a different charge which would more closely fit the evidence that the judge heard, that in those circumstances a Massachusetts defendant can raise a double jeopardy motion to dismiss if he is again charged with a crime, and if necessary, he can go to a single justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court prior to his second trial in order to get relief from a double jeopardy claim because the state's highest court recognized that double jeopardy protects individuals from the risk of having to undergo a trial, not just from convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.141" offset="10046201">Against that background, Your Honor, I submit it would have been reasonable for an attorney to conclude and to advise a client who wished to have that type of sophisticated advice that ordinarily if you choose the de novo system, your only remedy is a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.602" offset="10119971">However, if, on the other hand, the prosecutor does not present sufficient evidence to convict you, but the judge for some reason irrationally convicts you, that we may raise this point and this point only by way of a motion to dismiss in the second-tier, and apart from the fact, Your Honor, that that is the most reasonable conclusion that one can draw from the record, and it is in fact the conclusion about Mr. Lydon's--</text>

            <text syncTime="2736.697" offset="11096428">Massachusetts had that opportunity and didn't do so here, and its second attempt, if it is permitted to place Mr. Lydon twice in jeopardy by forcing him to undergo the de novo trial, raises a concern for the value that the double jeopardy clause implements in protecting innocent individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.995" offset="11193603">Mr. Lydon established in both federal courts that the only rational view of the transcript is that one faithfully applying the standard of law that the due process clause embodies must conclude he deserved to go free.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.207" offset="11262462">Even Judge Campbell, who dissented in the First Circuit, stated in his opinion there was probably no effective way for a prosecutor to supply evidence that Mr. Lydon committed the crime with which he is charged.</text>

            <text syncTime="3317.274" offset="13418714">That being so, and that being the defense strategy, it would not be well advised to allow the state to have two opportunities to present a case, because the state would have an opportunity only to improve--</text>

            <label>Mr. David Rossman</label>
            <text syncTime="3381.346" offset="13675027">--The word has historical understanding, Your Honor, and its custom and usage in Massachusetts indicates that when you appeal for a trial de novo, what you get is a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.421" offset="13723301">I would suggest, Your Honor, that the course that Massachusetts has chosen to adopt in response to the double jeopardy problem that it created for Mr. Lydon, in other words, notifying people in advance so that they have fair warning, is not the only course a court system may take if it wants to continue to experiment in the area of criminal justice and have a de novo system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.357" offset="13847017">Pennsylvania, for example, solves the problem that Massachusetts found itself in with Mr. Lydon by allowing individuals who have been convicted on insufficient evidence after an initial trial to obtain a review of the record in an appellate court, through a common law writ of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.671" offset="13928310">The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in its Lydon opinion stated that if it were wrong about the application of Burks to the double jeopardy... excuse me, to the de novo system, then judges in the second tier of the system should entertain such motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.399" offset="14003230">Now, if a state chose to adopt, or as Pennsylvania does, continued to have in operation that type of a system, that, I believe, Justice Stevens, would also answer your question in terms of federal intervention in state de novo systems, because one could expect that that second level of review would have two effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.200" offset="14106361">Number One, that second level of review would have the effect of discovering a lot of these mistakes, as indeed the mistake was discovered in Mr. Lydon's case, where the prosecutor conceded the evidence was insufficient and where Justice Wilkins read the transcript, and whether he was a reviewing court or was not a reviewing court, he at least wrote an opinion where he stated, I do not report my ruling that the evidence was insufficient, so that one would expect that if that type of review were incorporated into a de novo system, very few cases would survive and get to a federal habeas corpus court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.943" offset="14269365">A second consequence of that type of review would be to tighten up the procedure for evaluating evidence on the part of a judge and the preparation and presentation of evidence on the part of the prosecutor in the first tier court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.988" offset="14337597">I suggest, Your Honor, that the decision of the First Circuit can only have the effect on the quality of justice in the Massachusetts de novo system of improving adherence to the standards of due process by both judges and prosecutors because if double jeopardy does not apply to the first tier of a de novo system, then prosecutors and judges lack the normal incentive that prosecutors and judges have in our system faithfully to adhere to the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.029" offset="14489734">And if the Court credits at all the unanimous opinion of commentators, of judges from Massachusetts, of scholars, going back to 1922, when Felix Frankfurter and Roscoe Pound studied the lower criminal courts in the city of Cleveland, that the quality of justice in these courts suffers from a lack of adherence to the standards of due process, I submit that a decision telling these courts that double jeopardy did not apply because Massachusetts had decided never to look at the question of sufficiency of the evidence would be a decision in the wrong direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.606" offset="14656082">If I can address with the amount of time I have remaining the question of the appropriate nature of federal relief here granting the trial which will violate Mr. Lydon's constitutional rights has not yet occurred, I submit that Younger versus Harris considerations do apply, and I also submit, Your Honor, that Younger itself expressly recognizes an exception for cases where an individual establishes there will be a violation of double jeopardy, because that establishes that there will be an irreparable injury to his constitutional interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.816" offset="14812921">Jeopardy protects an individual and has always been understood to protect an individual from having to undergo a trial itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.171" offset="14850328">To my knowledge, only one other provision of the Constitution provides that same protection, not just against an unconstitutional conviction, but from the trial itself, the speech and debate clause, which hasn't much practical implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.281" offset="14910723">Where an individual is threatened with a trial that will violate double jeopardy, unless he gets relief prior to the trial, that much of the Constitution's protection will be irreparably lost if he has to wait until the trial is over to get relief, and Younger versus Harris recognizes that pretrial intervention may be appropriate where an individual can establish irreparable injury plus lack of an adequate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.652" offset="15036216">Well, Massachusetts has already said, we are giving you no remedy because we think there is no violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.556" offset="15059830">Since we wilfully won't look at the predicate for determining a double jeopardy violation, that is, we will never look at the sufficiency of the evidence, therefore, we will never discover a double jeopardy violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.614" offset="15112075">Since we won't discover one, we find--</text>
