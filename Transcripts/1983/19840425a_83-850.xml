            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="76.953" offset="458813">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.638" offset="489638">It gives the Court the opportunity to revisit some issues that it considered last year in connection with the use of a very important law enforcement technique, the beeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.150" offset="539689">Now, the case began when DEA agents investigating drug manufacturing activities in Albuquerque, New Mexico, through a course of investigation discovered that a gentleman named Carl Muehlenweg was acting as a front to acquire chemicals for certain illicit drug manufacturing operations, and they searched Muehlenweg's premises, and Muehlenweg agreed to cooperate with them in further investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.852" offset="682422">And some time thereafter he advised them that certain individuals had through him placed an order for 50 gallons of ether to be used in the process of extracting cocaine from clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.471" offset="748877">The agents with the consent of Mr. Muehlenweg and pursuant to a court order which was later held to be invalid secreted in the bottom of one of the containers or actually manufactured a duplicate container of ether and secreted a beeper, transmitter in the bottom of the container.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.414" offset="856711">This was picked up by respondent Karo, who was followed by visual and beeper surveillance to his house.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.534" offset="889207">Later that day the signal was no longer coming from the area of Karo's house, but the container or the beeper signal, at least, was located at respondent Horton's house, and the agents identified the general vicinity with the beeper and then walked by the outside of Horton's house and were able to smell the ether emanating from somewhere on the property.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="213.821" offset="1006340">Let me back you up a moment, Mr. Frey.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.085" offset="1015431">When the device, the beeper, as you call it, was placed in the drum, was it placed with the consent of the owner of that drum?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="228.423" stopTime="255.601">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="228.423" offset="1064750">It was placed with the consent of the owner at that time, although of course it was known that it was going to be delivered to other persons in the future, but at the time there was consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.654" offset="1105605">In any event, whether or not there was consent I don't think would be material here, because the invasion of the drum at that time did not invade any property interest or any privacy interest of any of the respondents, at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.773" offset="1158164">But there was in fact consent.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="255.601" stopTime="284.981">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="255.601" offset="1173419">Mr. Frey, supposing you carried that to a more extreme situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.100" offset="1195467">Supposing the government is very anxious to monitor the movements of a very suspected big criminal and they simply go to the men's clothing store where he shops and with the agreement of the salesperson have a beeper put in whatever tie he buys.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.044" offset="1271222">Now, obviously that is a more extreme situation than this, but is the logic much different?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="284.981" stopTime="316.874">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="284.981" offset="1290970">No, I don't think the logic would be much different.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.260" offset="1304031">The issue in this case, and the Court of Appeals didn't suggest that there was any Fourth Amendment violation in the installation by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.835" offset="1338409">It was only the subsequent delivery of the container that contained the transmitter, which in their view gave rise to a Fourth Amendment problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.706" offset="1381876">In our view, it is the monitoring of that transmitter that gives rise to a Fourth Amendment issue, and not the mere silent presence of it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="316.874" stopTime="317.156">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="316.874" offset="1418552">Not the installation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="317.156" stopTime="375.117">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="317.156" offset="1419702">I don't see how without the monitoring you have either a search or a seizure that is regulated by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.387" offset="1456587">You acquire no information from merely installing a dead or silent beeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.571" offset="1481351">It is of no value to you whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.133" offset="1491591">So, in fact, suppose that the men's clothing store on its own had sewn this in their customer's tie and then had called up the FBI and said, we put a beeper in the tie.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.969" offset="1562957">He has come and picked it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.078" offset="1567346">If you want to follow him around, use the beeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.608" offset="1585422">Please feel free.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.967" offset="1590856">In my view, that would pose exactly the same Fourth Amendment question, and therefore I don't think it's the installation, even though that would have been a private installation of the beeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.713" offset="1625860">I think it's the monitoring which may or may not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="375.117" stopTime="385.300">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="375.117" offset="1651460">Does that mean, Mr. Frey, that it would also be precisely the same issue if after he purchased the tie the government installed the beeper?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="385.300" stopTime="392.813">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="385.300" offset="1692211">Well, it might be necessary at that point for them to seize his property or search his property.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="392.813" stopTime="402.278">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="392.813" offset="1722304">Well, he checked his coat in a cloakroom somewhere, and they stuck the beeper in the coat while it was in the cloakroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.810" offset="1746232">Would that be precisely the same issue we have today, or would it be a different one?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="402.278" stopTime="448.494">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="402.278" offset="1760129">I think that would be essentially the same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.575" offset="1769324">That is our principal reliance on this point about the installation.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.540" offset="1785207">It is not that there was consent to the original installation, because that only, that addresses the question whether the original installation was itself a search or a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.927" offset="1830764">If we wanted to install a transponder in somebody's aircraft and we had to open the door of the aircraft, climb in, and fiddle around with the radio equipment, that would be a search of the interior of the aircraft which would be regulated by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.343" offset="1888443">If we had consent, it would be a valid search.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.404" offset="1896698">But the real question in this case is whether we acquire information or seize property at some point.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="448.494" offset="1944972">I am just trying to isolate the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.569" offset="1949360">In your view, the only issue is whether it is okay to listen to the beeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.131" offset="1967542">The manner of installation, unless there is something--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="456.365" stopTime="468.000">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="456.365" offset="1976528">Well, I don't see how the... unless the installation is itself a search or seizure that might violate the Fourth Amendment rights of the individual, then I fail to understand--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="468.000" stopTime="473.795">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="468.000" offset="2023026">--Supposing they put a microphone on the tie.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.625" offset="2033579">That would also not raise a Fourth Amendment question until they listened to it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="473.795" stopTime="815.782">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="473.795" offset="2046222">--Not until they listened to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.435" offset="2048730">Not if they didn't listen to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.779" offset="2054164">Nothing would be a fruit of that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.950" offset="2066807">I mean, we are talking about suppressing evidence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.229" offset="2079973">There has to be a fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.588" offset="2085406">There can only be a fruit of this kind of technology if you listen to it or take advantage of the signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.413" offset="2116649">So I don't... I see that issue as a red herring and not the real problem of substance, if there is one in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.581" offset="2145383">I wanted to just follow the course of the investigation a little further, because I think it is typical of these drug manufacturing cases and useful for the Court to appreciate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.953" offset="2182895">After it was at Horton's house, which was the second premises, it was then... a couple of days later they walked by.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.278" offset="2224169">They no longer smelled ether.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.042" offset="2227199">They then used the beeper to determine that it had been moved at or near the premises of Horton's father, and later that day the signal was no longer coming from that vicinity, and the beeper was then traced to a set of storage lockers in Albuquerque, which I gather are walk-in type storage lockers that people can rent for long periods of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.110" offset="2331480">The particular locker in which the ether was located was identified by smell by the agents walking and then by a conversation with the manager of the storage locker which ascertained that Horton and perhaps Harley had... were the renters of this particular locker.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.900" offset="2410683">The agents then obtained a court order to install an entry tone alarm in the door of this locker which would warn them when the door of the locker was opened, and they did install such an alarm, but it malfunctioned, and about a week later they got a call from the manager of the storage lockers who said, by the way, these fellows have taken the stuff out of the storage locker.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.764" offset="2498141">So again using the beeper, they tracked the container to another group of storage lockers, again identified the particular locker by smell and by interviewing the manager of the locker.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.118" offset="2559476">This time they placed... they rented a locker which I guess was opposite from the one that the respondents were using and put a TV monitor on there focused on the door of the storage locker containing the ether, and the ether sat there for about three and a half months at this point, and then respondent Rhodes, who is the only one of the defendants not to prevail in the Court of Appeals, arrived at the locker in Horton's pickup truck, emptied out the contents of the locker, drove to the vicinity of his residence, picked up some other things, and then went to Taos, New Mexico, which I think is about 150 miles away, followed by visual and beeper surveillance, to the ultimate destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.973" offset="2766889">The agents then surveilled this destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.968" offset="2794892">In this case they used the beeper in the course of their surveillance actually to determine that the containers were inside the residence in Taos, and during their surveillance they saw at one point that all the windows were open, although it was a very cold and windy day, and they knew from that that the ether was actually being put to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.085" offset="2887365">They then procured a conventional search warrant from the District Court, executed a search, and seized cocaine, marijuana, laboratory equipment, and other items.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.893" offset="2930624">Now, the District Court found that the original order that had been sought to authorize the beeper surveillance was invalid because it had falsely represented that Muehlenweg, the informant, was a target of the investigation, and that without the false representations, the warrant failed to show probable cause, and the court held that probable cause and a warrant is required for the use of beeper surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.897" offset="3050578">The government appealed to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.301" offset="3064267">We did not challenge the ruling on the validity of the warrant, but rather we took the position which we take today that no warrant is necessary for the use of this particular kind of beeper surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.123" offset="3123512">The Court of Appeals generally affirmed the decision of the District Court, and it found both that the installation and delivery of the beeper container itself violated the rights of the transferee to be free from unreasonable searches without a warrant, and that the monitoring of the signals emitted by the beeper is itself a search if it happens at the time of the monitoring that the beeper-laden container has been taken into private premises that would not be subject to a conventional search without a warrant based on probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.705" offset="3245870">Now, I wanted to say a few words about what beepers are and their utility in law enforcement, and I thought for the... I know the Court was very curious during the Knotts argument, so I had the DA supply me with a beeper just so that you can see what it looks like.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.571" offset="3329357">It is... I understand that it is installed... these are batteries.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.289" offset="3344195">This is the transmitter.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.318" offset="3348270">And it is packed in styrofoam in this way and put in the false bottom of a container, as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.237" offset="3384005">This is not the beeper that was used in this case, but it is similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.002" offset="3403022">It is actually a little smaller, I am told, than the one used in this case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="815.782" offset="3414203">Mr. Frey, was the beeper actually put in evidence in the case?</text>

            <text syncTime="819.249" offset="3427995">I'm not sure that it was, and I don't rely on any conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.058" offset="3443251">It is just to satisfy the curiosity that I thought the Court exhibited during the Knotts argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.291" offset="3468224">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.900" offset="3478673">This is an FM radio transmitter.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.446" offset="3484838">It emits a signal that allows the beeper to be located by the use of appropriately designed receiving equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.695" offset="3509811">Now, this equipment cannot pinpoint very precisely the location of the signal coming from the beeper unless you get quite close.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.676" offset="3545755">There are basically two kinds of uses for beepers.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.847" offset="3566444">One is attaching them to vehicles to follow the vehicles, aircraft, or so on, on the highway, and the second is implanting them in containers, as in this case, as in the Knotts case.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.919" offset="3614719">There it is usually done in drug investigations, but it could be used with explosives or containers of firearms that are suspected to be exported or other kinds of containers that would not be likely to be opened and have the beeper revealed prematurely.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.663" offset="3681697">The essential purpose of the beeper is to facilitate the process of surveillance of the movement of cars, chemicals, or other containers that are suspected to be involved in illicit activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.626" offset="3733524">Basically it is a substitute for the human eye in following these movements, but it is tremendously valuable both in enabling a surveillance to be conducted effectively with limited personnel resources and in generally reducing the danger that the surveillance will be detected by the suspects.</text>

            <text syncTime="1067.993" offset="4423052">Now, I think that probably the procedure that should have been used here was to make an accurate description in the search warrant and file it under seal, but at some point down the road you can be sure that the defendants would have demanded the right to see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.737" offset="4485955">Now, in this particular case, of course, Muehlenweg's identity as an informant was disclosed at the suppression hearing, but there is a concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.015" offset="4531094">I don't think that the action of the agent and the assistant U.S. Attorney was outrageous in this case, even if in retrospect we can say it was ill-advised, but the real concern about requiring us to get a warrant is not so much that we can't do it, although I don't think it performs a very useful function, as I will get to later, but that there are classes of cases in which the use of the beeper is very important but we don't have probable cause, but only a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.642" offset="4645615">So that if you are... the holding that a warrant is required is a holding that beeper surveillance cannot be employed on the basis of reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, I think that is our practical concern.</text>

            <text syncTime="1232.991" offset="5083009">I just wanted to make the point before I get back to Justice White's question, which I do want to address, that this case is typical in demonstrating the value of the beeper in illicit drug manufacturing investigations, because people involved in such activities often proceed very cautiously with various kinds of countersurveillance activities, which include, as in this case, moving the containers to seven different locations and delaying their actual... actually putting them to their illicit use for a period of four and a half months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.852" offset="5218428">Now, effective investigation and apprehension in this case would have been as a practical matter impossible even though as a theoretical matter if we were willing to assign 100 agents to the task for a period of four and a half months we could have done it, but with the beeper, a handful of agents who can also do other things at the same time are able to conduct an effective investigation which led to the discovery of a serious crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.232" offset="5315917">Now, I would like to get to the question about whether this is or is not any different from Knotts, because our position is that this case is not analytically different from Knotts, and that what happened here was not a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.743" offset="5374013">Now, the point essentially that we want to make is that Knotts established that to use the beeper to ascertain the location to which a container has been taken over the public roads is not a search at all regulated by the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1699.427" offset="6948779">This is probably not probable cause that would be enough to justify us getting a warrant to search the house of the person if we followed them to that place where they took the container, yet it is enough to warrant an investigation, and in Adams against Williams the Court said the policeman shouldn't just shrug his shoulders and go away, that the only effective means of investigation in this circumstance, the most effective means is the use of the beeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.370" offset="7048567">It has a very limited intrusion, if any, on people's privacy, and it seems to me when you balance that intrusion against the value to law enforcement, a Terry kind of standard is quite appropriate, and I just would refer to Justice Brennan's concurring opinion in Jacobson where he made precisely that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1806.695" offset="7377814">He said at that time that that was a different case and a lot stronger case for it being a search.</text>

            <text syncTime="2234.601" offset="9089462">They went and got a warrant, and if they had not lied in the warrant, we probably wouldn't be here today, but instead of being embarrassed, they are here asking for a new exception to the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.798" offset="9142229">In trying to avoid the Fourth, they make four basic arguments.</text>

            <text syncTime="2260.262" offset="9192071">Secondly, that a reduced expectation of privacy, that there is somehow a reduced expectation of privacy in containers and areas they enter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2280.597" offset="9273468">And fourth, that even if probable cause is required, a warrant should not be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.282" offset="9300218">Now, in dealing with the fact that it is not a search, I think it is very important to distinguish between limited capability and limited information, and limited intrusiveness and limited information.</text>

            <text syncTime="2580.570" offset="10473324">I think that that is true, but I think that the amount of possible locations the beeper is at would severely diminish any probable cause that was attempted to... that they might attempt to get later.</text>

            <text syncTime="3451.704" offset="13957850">It is a chilling factor to know that the government just on its own discretion can place beepers anywhere and activate them at the turn of a switch, to follow any object, any vehicle, any thing, and as militarization increases, they can probably do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.774" offset="14026187">The one you saw today may be the size of a pencil tomorrow, and down to this level indicating the next day, and this Court really needs to consider about allowing that sort of surveillance without any judicial information protection which would be afforded by a Fourth Amendment warrant and probable cause requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3659.948" offset="14790843">Well, it was not material to the search warrant, because they knew... they had information from Muehlenweg that there was a cocaine manufacturing operation going on in Taos.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.320" offset="14828355">They had followed the ether to the house, and they saw the windows open, which told them that the ether was inside being used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.145" offset="14859597">So it was wholly superfluous, the particular fix, and that raises the question about respondents Roth and Steele.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.937" offset="14894810">The only claim that they could have is with respect to the use at the Taos residence, which was immaterial to the procurement of the warrant and the seizure of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.653" offset="14933680">With respect to the first three premises to the vicinity of which it was taken, there is no evidence that it went into Karo's house or Horton's house or Horton's father's house.</text>
