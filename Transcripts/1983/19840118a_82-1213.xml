            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="153333">We'll hear arguments next in New York against Quarles.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.027" offset="185411">Mr. Rappaport, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_j_rappaport" startTime="22.936" stopTime="228.252">
            <label>Mr. Steven J. Rappaport</label>
            <text syncTime="22.936" offset="245075">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="25.578" offset="255629">The issue in this case is whether the Court of Appeals of the State of New York properly suppressed the defendant's statement, the gun is over there, as having been elicited in violation of his federal constitutional rights and, if so, whether they also properly suppressed the defendant's subsequent statements admitting ownership of the gun, and the gun itself which was recovered seconds after the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.574" offset="351550">This Court has made it clear that the primary purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter police misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.332" offset="394600">Since Officer Kraft acted properly in the instant case, however, there is simply no purpose to be served by exclusion of any of the evidence obtained as a result of his actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.079" offset="437545">Briefly, the facts of the case are that Officer Kraft had probable cause to believe that the Respondent had committed a rape and was in possession of a gun in a supermarket.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.302" offset="514450">When the Respondent saw Officer Kraft, he ran towards the back of the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.304" offset="534512">Kraft pursued, lost sight of him for a few seconds, caught up to him, handcuffed him, frisked him, found an empty shoulder holster, and then asked, where is the gun?</text>
            <text syncTime="107.643" offset="583831">The defendant indicated a carton a few feet away.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.445" offset="595011">He said, there is the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.596" offset="603684">Kraft recovered the gun from that carton and then asked the defendant, is this your gun?</text>
            <text syncTime="118.410" offset="626881">The defendant said, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.220" offset="634195">He admitted ownership of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.483" offset="643181">And, Kraft asked where he bought it and the Respondent told him where he bought it.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.155" offset="669931">Under the circumstances then, it is our position that Officer Kraft acted in a necessary and prudent fashion in securing that gun as quickly as he could.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.765" offset="728340">The contention of the Respondent or of the Court of Appeals, of course, was that Officer Kraft's action was prescribed by this Court's opinion in Miranda versus Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.515" offset="779331">If one examines the considerations underlying the Miranda opinion, however, it becomes clear that none of those considerations apply in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.893" offset="820814">Specifically, the Miranda opinion talked about a lengthy interrogation in an incommunicado atmosphere with abusive police practices that lead to unreliable confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.119" offset="873790">Well, in the instant case, we have a single question asked at a public place for the purpose of protection of the police officers and any members of the public who might be in the vicinity and there were no abusive police practices because the officers had already holstered their weapons at the time that the question was asked, and the defendant's statement was completely reliable and its reliability was, in fact, proved seconds later when the gun was located exactly where the Respondent said that it would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.371" offset="998760">Of course, it may be said that even if the considerations underlying the Miranda opinion do not apply to the case, the holding of the Miranda opinion requires suppression of the defendant's statement and the derivative evidence.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="228.252" stopTime="234.096">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="228.252" offset="1066260">When you say the holding of the Miranda opinion, was there a holding in Miranda?</text>

          <turn speaker="steven_j_rappaport" startTime="234.096" stopTime="238.498">
            <label>Mr. Steven J. Rappaport</label>
            <text syncTime="234.096" offset="1089666">Well, as I understand it, the holding of the case was that--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="238.498" stopTime="253.467">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="238.498" offset="1107325">It was really all dicta, the whole opinion, wasn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="241.710" offset="1120073">Because none of the facts of the particular Miranda fellow, who was convicted of an offense and everything, didn't raise any of the questions that the Court decided.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_j_rappaport" startTime="253.467" stopTime="273.600">
            <label>Mr. Steven J. Rappaport</label>
            <text syncTime="253.467" offset="1167197">--I understand what you are saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.070" offset="1173571">That is why I thought it important to discuss the considerations underlying the opinion which take up a great portion of the body of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.495" offset="1207217">But, whether you want to call it dicta or holding, the Court certainly prescribed certain rules for police officers to follow.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="273.600" stopTime="275.422">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="273.600" offset="1247655">There have been quite a few cases since then.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_j_rappaport" startTime="275.422" stopTime="348.160">
            <label>Mr. Steven J. Rappaport</label>
            <text syncTime="275.422" offset="1254969">There have been many cases since then, of course, interpreting that.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.504" offset="1271269">It is our position, of course, that while we are willing to concede for purposes of our argument that defendant was in custody at the time the question was asked, we submit he was not subjected to interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.375" offset="1342740">Now, there was language in the Miranda opinion itself exempting from the definition of custodial interrogation general on-the-scene questioning as to facts surrounding a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.904" offset="1384850">The opinion itself left open, however, whether such questioning can occur when an individual was in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.708" offset="1416092">Now, this Court did not return to the definition of interrogation for purposes of the Fifth Amendment until 1980 in Rhode Island versus Innis.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.815" offset="1452559">In Innis, of course, the Court held that in addition to express questioning interrogation also includes any words or actions on the part of the police officer other than those normally attendant in arrest and custody which the police should know are pretty likely to elicit an incriminating response.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.857" offset="1532703">Now, if that Innis standard--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="348.160" stopTime="373.618">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="348.160" offset="1545973">In Innis the Court seems to have decided that unlike Williams against Brewer that there was no question put to Innis.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.380" offset="1602815">There was a statement made by one policeman to another which was said to have stimulated the response of the accused.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_j_rappaport" startTime="373.618" stopTime="374.636">
            <label>Mr. Steven J. Rappaport</label>
            <text syncTime="373.618" offset="1647746">--That is correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="374.636" stopTime="380.890">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="374.636" offset="1651821">This question was directed to the accused, was it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_j_rappaport" startTime="380.890" stopTime="431.164">
            <label>Mr. Steven J. Rappaport</label>
            <text syncTime="380.890" offset="1676794">Yes, it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.031" offset="1685362">Of course, it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.413" offset="1690900">But, I was about to say that if the Innis standard were to be applied to the case at bar, we would submit that the question, where is the gun, posed to an individual who is being arrested for an armed felony, and when there is reason to believe that there is a gun in the immediate vicinity of the arrest in a public place, it must be considered normally attendant to the arrest and custody of that individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.982" offset="1797166">However, as you point out, the Innis opinion itself did not involve an express question and we would submit that on the face of the opinion the standard set forth in this was not meant to apply to express questions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="431.164" stopTime="464.035">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="431.164" offset="1877937">Well, Mr. Rappaport, certainly the language in Rhode Island versus Innis seemed to indicate that questions reasonably likely to elicit incriminating responses were not allowable in the absence of the Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.829" offset="1964559">And, it seems to me that your proposal is certainly contrary to that as to the admissibility of the response to that question.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_j_rappaport" startTime="464.035" stopTime="570.926">
            <label>Mr. Steven J. Rappaport</label>
            <text syncTime="464.035" offset="2009385">Well, I think, Justice O'Connor, that the face of the Innis opinion says that interrogation is either express questioning or the functional equivalent of express questioning and then went on to define the functional equivalent of express questioning in terms of whether it is reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.774" offset="2116383">Again, as the Chief Justice pointed out, the Innis opinion itself did not involve an express question and the standard it was formulating was not intended to apply to express questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.449" offset="2159119">Now, there have been, however, many state and lower federal court opinions which have answered the question which both Miranda and Innis left open, specifically whether any expressed questions asked of an individual in custody can not be considered interrogation for purposes of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.708" offset="2276148">Specifically... It is universally accepted that booking and pedigree questions do not constitute interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.044" offset="2313451">Secondly, there are a series of cases from many jurisdictions relying on the language of Miranda involving general on-the-scene questioning referring to questions preliminary or neutral or designed to clarify the nature of the situation confronted.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.275" offset="2382414">What all of these cases have in common is this recognition that sometimes expressed questions asked of an individual in custody may not constitute interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.834" offset="2424628">I think it depends on the nature of the question asked.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="570.926" stopTime="574.978">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="570.926" offset="2436957">This question goes to the very heart of the offense, doesn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_j_rappaport" startTime="574.978" stopTime="586.056">
            <label>Mr. Steven J. Rappaport</label>
            <text syncTime="574.978" offset="2453153">Well, given that the offense now... The only charge left open now is the possession of the weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.183" offset="2490038">Of course, it does.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="586.056" stopTime="590.418">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="586.056" offset="2497457">That is pretty incriminating, I suppose.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_j_rappaport" startTime="590.418" stopTime="644.023">
            <label>Mr. Steven J. Rappaport</label>
            <text syncTime="590.418" offset="2514907">There is no question that that is incriminating, but the mere fact that the answer to a question might be incriminating or is even likely to be incriminating does not necessarily mean that Miranda prescribes the question to be asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.151" offset="2589931">More specifically relevant to the instant case, there have been many or at least several state and lower court cases dealing with the issue of questioning a defendant about the presence of a weapon in the immediate vicinity of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.102" offset="2661715">And, these cases have generally held that such questioning does not constitute interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.135" offset="2681777">Now, sometimes they use the same reasoning as the general on-the-scene questioning cases, talking about... saying that the question about a weapon, in fact, was designed to clarify the nature of the situation--</text>

            <text syncTime="785.195" offset="3294087">Just to conclude on this issue, however, I think an alternative rationale with respect to the admission of the first statement would be to say that it doesn't really matter whether you call this interrogation or not, but the exigent circumstances of having the gun loose in the supermarket overrode the necessity for Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.884" offset="3404846">Also, it is undisputed that the officer had a right to search the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.609" offset="3439746">Given that right, it is up to Congress to say he does not have the right also to ask him where the gun was.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.892" offset="3460853">Whichever theory you choose to use, however, the point is that Officer Kraft acted properly and, given that fact, there is no reason to suppress the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.209" offset="3506097">Now, it is also our position that if, in fact, it is found that the defendant's initial statement was to be suppressed, then the subsequent statement and the gun itself need not be suppressed.</text>

            <text syncTime="991.339" offset="4118616">Well, with respect to the argument with regard to Michigan versus Tucker, of course, we believe that this would not be a Fifth Amendment violation even if, in fact, the question was a violation of this Court's opinion in Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.613" offset="4195730">The conduct at issue here certainly bears no resemblance to the historical practices at which the Fifth Amendment was aimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.629" offset="4239824">Therefore, the Wong Sun test for determining the admissibility of derivate evidence need not be applied and there should be a balancing between the benefits and detriments of exclusion of the derivative evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.980" offset="4301160">We think if one does that balancing, it is clear that the deterrent effect of excluding the derivative evidence is minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.998" offset="4341284">It is even questionable to what extent the exclusionary rule ever really deters police misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.750" offset="4368242">Certainly we are talking about derivative evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.812" offset="4380572">That effect is even lessened because the police officer would not be likely to want to risk losing the full confession in the hope of gaining derivative evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1140.818" offset="4716507">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.982" offset="4741166">In Rhode Island against Innis, the Court specifically excepted from its definition of interrogation questions normally attendant to arrest and custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.879" offset="4784843">And, it is our position that Officer Kraft's question, where is the gun, belongs to a definable category of questions that are incident to an arrest; that is to say his question was part of the process of safely and successfully completing the arrest of Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.722" offset="4868122">And, in our view, Miranda warnings should not be required before question that is incident to an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.027" offset="4901349">Now, when Respondent was asked, where is the gun, he had undoubtedly been seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and it has been assumed all along that he had been arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.625" offset="4947743">But, it does not follow, as the court below seemed to believe, that he, therefore, had to be given Miranda warnings immediately before he was asked any questions whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.745" offset="5000301">The concepts of arrest and seizure are Fourth Amendment concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.837" offset="5020677">Miranda rules are derived from the Fifth Amendment which, of course, serves quite different purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.681" offset="5043978">And, there is no reason for the Miranda rules necessarily to become automatically applicable whenever there is a Fourth Amendment arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.028" offset="5081385">That does not serve the purposes of Miranda and, very importantly, it certainly does not provide police officers with any clearer guidance about when they should give Miranda warnings than the interpretation of Miranda that we propose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.301" offset="5170515">In that case, there is no indication that the questions they asked were even asked roughly at the same time of the arrest, let alone that they were necessary to completing the process of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.349" offset="5214714">I think Orozco can be understood as a case in which the police officers, because they couldn't bring the accused to the station house and interrogate him without Miranda warnings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1892.651" offset="7723932">But, we have now refined that further and have come to the extent of saying arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of a degree associated with formal arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.468" offset="7771162">And, what I submit here, Mr. Justice White, is that you have an individual who has been handcuffed, frisked, and arrested.</text>

            <text syncTime="3701.533" offset="14959433">With respect to the issue of the independent and adequate state ground, I would like to refer the Court to its opinion in Michigan versus Long where the Court said that if, in fact, the state court wishes to base its decision on an independent and adequate state ground, it is incumbent upon that court to make explicit that it intends to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3765.467" offset="15215119">Well, I think the point is that there were reasons behind this Court's opinion in Long and this case might present a reason for the application of that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.498" offset="15279276">The only portion of the Court of Appeals decision which could be interpreted as raising an independent and adequate state ground is the portion cited by counsel where he said that the People never raised the issue of the safety of the public as distinguished from the safety of the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.756" offset="15348344">However, the Court made a finding of fact that the record did not establish that there were, in fact, those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.402" offset="15378855">It is that finding which we are asking the Court to review now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.935" offset="15393065">One other point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.437" offset="15402992">Counsel characterized our discussion of Miranda as permitting an open-ended kind of activity on the part of police and requiring a totality of the circumstances approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.017" offset="15469343">We submit that we are doing no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.632" offset="15487837">We are saying that objectively speaking any time there is a gun in the immediate vicinity of an arrest in a public place, it is reasonably prudent protective measure for the police to take to ask about the location of that gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.900" offset="15544889">If there is any question of the totality of the circumstances approach, I submit that Respondent is, in effect, asking for that when he can see that well under some circumstances there might be exigent circumstances, but not in this case.</text>
