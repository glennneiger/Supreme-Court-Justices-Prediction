            <text syncTime="71.002" offset="432022">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="73.096" offset="440381">The issue in these consolidated cases is whether Section 613A of the Internal Revenue Code permits a lessor of oil and gas property who receives an advance payment upon the execution of a lease, the advance payment either in the form of a lease bonus or an advance royalty, is entitled to a percentage depletion deduction against those royalties even though no oil or gas allocated to that income is produced during the taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.304" offset="549155">The facts in both of these cases are not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.163" offset="560649">In the Farmar case in 1976 taxpayers leased the mineral estate of lands they owned in Texas to two companies interested in oil and gas exploration.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.236" offset="600878">Part of the compensation for that agreement was a substantial lease bonus to be paid in installments, and that was in no way dependent upon the actual production of oil or gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.685" offset="638703">Instead, it was based on the acreage of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.575" offset="650301">Taxpayers also included in that agreement a provision allowing them to receive royalties for any oil or gas actually produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.118" offset="684470">During the 1976 tax year oil and gas was extracted from those properties, and a royalty was paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.864" offset="715399">Taxpayers in their 1976 federal income tax returns claimed a 22 percent depletion deduction for both the lease bonus payment and the royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.390" offset="769524">In the Engle case in 1975 the taxpayers assigned a lease to properties they had in Wyoming to producers in return for an overriding royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.479" offset="813932">As part of the compensation scheme there the taxpayers in this case received an advance royalty of $7600.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.601" offset="850399">During the 1975 tax year there was, however, no production.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.554" offset="866177">Nevertheless, the taxpayers on their federal income tax returns for 1975 claimed a 22 percent depletion deduction for the advanced royalties that they had received.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.423" offset="905675">In both of these cases the Commissioner assessed a deficiency by disallowing the percentage depletion deductions for payments that were received that had no relationship to any actual production during the taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.059" offset="956248">The Farmars paid the deficiency and filed suit for return of the monies in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.369" offset="985400">The Engles, on the other hand, brought a proceeding in the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.789" offset="999088">The Court of Claims unanimously and the Tax Court by a vote of 14 to 1 upheld the Commissioner's decision and determined that Section 613A did not allow deductions in the absence of production during the taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.032" offset="1060110">The Engles appealed the judgment of the Tax Court to the Seventh Circuit which reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.172" offset="1076620">Both the Commissioner and the Farmar's filed separate petitions to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.904" offset="1103578">They were granted and the case consolidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.559" offset="1110161">Prior to 1975 it was clear that the lease bonuses and advance royalties at issue in this case would have been subject to the percentage depletion deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.993" offset="1151957">Prior to 1975 under Section 611 of the Internal Revenue Code which allows a deduction for a reasonable allowance for depreciation and Section 613 which allows a deduction for gross income from the oil or gas producing property this Court had concluded the only statutory condition for allowance of the depletion deduction was the existence of gross income, and since this Court had also concluded that advance payments either in the form of lease bonuses of advance royalties were gross income from the property the deduction was permitted.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="311.827" offset="1395314">Well, is there anything in the statute we are talking about here or the amendments that specifically changes the definition of gross income to exclude bonuses and advance royalties or that overrules Herring?</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="326.666" offset="1454664">Nothing that expressly does that.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.539" offset="1462083">Congress did add Subsection D to Section 613 in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.928" offset="1483712">Subsection D says you do not start with Section 613 which is the provision that forces you to look at gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.128" offset="1512447">Instead it says that you look first at Section 613A and only for so much of the production as you can demonstrate satisfies the requirements of Section 613A do you then come back into Section 613 and apply the gross income tests under Herring and for that matter all of the Commissioner's rulings regarding gross income.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.853" offset="1603353">Well, Congress did not change the definition of gross income is what you are saying, but it did state that the deduction for percentage depletion had to be with respect to production.</text>

            <text syncTime="389.421" offset="1705648">Well, of course, that is not the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.622" offset="1718501">They are seeking to assert the deduction in this taxable year.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="401.369" offset="1753400">Well, I will concede that that is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.320" offset="1773253">The Commissioner's view is that the focus in Section 613A on production in the taxable year seems to expect that that is the taxable year that they focus on.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.080" offset="1828319">When the income is acquired prior to actual production the Commissioner has concluded that Congress simply did not intend for that to be subject to the depletion allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.231" offset="1880878">As I said, Justice, I think in this case where the Seventh Circuit held that both interpretations are reasonable I submit that you could probably make a reasonable argument with regard to the hypothetical you set, but I think it important to make clear that regardless of how you decide your hypothetical you would still deny the deduction for the taxpayers in these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="461.407" offset="1993622">The Commissioner has taken the position at least with respect to the hypothetical he presented in his proposed regulations that if you have say $100,000 of production in one year and $85,000 of income in that year and $15,000 of income in the next year he will permit you the $15,000 deduction in--</text>

            <text syncTime="488.849" offset="2103337">I think the exception made for that... It is not clear that he would allow that if all of the income were derived in a separate year, only if a small portion is.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.126" offset="2144506">In addition, it is clear that that distinction that the Commissioner has drawn is fully consistent with the intention and purpose of Section 613A.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.404" offset="2181599">That is, Congress' dominant concern was to assure the production of oil and gas, the extraction of oil in hand and certainly under the hypothetical that the Commissioner has proposed you have production in hand so, therefore, he has decided to go ahead and allow that.</text>

            <text syncTime="763.787" offset="3203092">In 1975 Congress in the Tax Reduction Act eliminated for the most part percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.142" offset="3236528">After 1975 the existence of the percentage depletion allowance was no longer contingent exclusively on the existence of gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.201" offset="3276757">Instead Congress added Subsection D to Section 613 which expressly requires the taxpayer to determine availability of any deduction, percentage deduction that is, under Section 613A first and then determine on the basis of whether you comply with the requirements of Section 613A how much of the deduction generally specified in Section 611 will be computed specifically under Section 613.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.970" offset="3387830">Congress in Section 613A permitted percentage depletion for a royalty owner such as the taxpayers in these cases who leased to an independent producer</text>
            <text syncTime="821.669" offset="3434641">"with respect to so much of the taxpayer's average daily production of domestic crude oil as does not exceed the taxpayer's depletable oil and natural gas quantity. "</text>
            <text syncTime="833.148" offset="3480512">Average daily production is determined by dividing the aggregate production for the year by the number of days in the taxable years.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.537" offset="3510083">The depletable quantity is an arbitrary number that the Congress had set in order to limit the maximum amount of production and the guarantee that the producers were in effect small producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.735" offset="3550938">As the majority of the Tax Court held, Section 613A places repeated emphasis on the concept of production, and production itself commonly means extraction from the ground and, therefore, it is fair to read the statutory language itself as requiring actual production during the taxable year, and accordingly the taxpayers in this case who cannot attribute any of their income to actual production during the taxable year are not entitled under the plain meaning of the language of Section 613A to a percentage depletion deduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="916.287" offset="3813103">The "with respect to" language is actually the pivotal language in our mind in determining that production is crucial because it is only with respect to so much production that you are allowed any kind of a depletion.</text>

            <text syncTime="931.499" offset="3873916">"except as provided in Subsection D the allowance for depletion under Section 611 shall be computed in accordance with Section 613 with respect to so much of the taxpayers average daily production of domestic crude oil as does not exceed the taxpayers depletable oil quantity.

            <text syncTime="959.021" offset="3984048">It is clear that it is with respect to both that you have to have some production and with respect to so much as does not exceed the depletable quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.892" offset="4015500">So anything over 2000 barrels in 1975 will not be with respect to which you can deduct under the percentage depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.309" offset="4049250">Just as if you do not have any production it is with respect to zero production that you are allowed the depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.432" offset="4073701">So I would read that language as saying with respect to whatever number between 1 and 2000 barrels are produced by primary means of extraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.022" offset="4112048">Of course, the taxpayers are still entitled to cost depletion under Section 612, but in our reading of the plain meaning of the statute they are no longer entitled to percentage depletion simply as a simple arithmetic means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.844" offset="4179340">That is, the numerator of aggregate production is zero divided by any number obviously equals zero, and so with respect to how much production is there a deduction the answer is zero.</text>

            <text syncTime="1046.156" offset="4332626">He does require them to capitalize it as a straight deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.061" offset="4348195">He continues to take the view that the lease bonus and advance royalties are not subject to the percentage depletion allowance to the lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.245" offset="4384976">That, by the way, is compelled I think in the House committee report in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.304" offset="4405142">We submit that the result compelled by the statutory language is equally supported by the only relevant legislative history in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.489" offset="4437952">When the Tax Reduction Act was passed out of the House committee in 1975 it contained no provision with regard to oil and gas depletion, and an amendment on the House floor completely abolished oil and gas depletion which passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.968" offset="4495839">The bill then went to the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.015" offset="4500019">Again, the Senate Finance Committee reported out a bill that again contained no provision for oil and gas depletion, and on the floor of the Senate was the amendment added that conforms basically to Section 613A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.758" offset="4566997">All of the courts that have considered this issue below have concluded that reading the legislative history in 1975 provides no useful insights into the solution of the problem presented by these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.393" offset="4617570">That is, there is nothing in there that tells you how to treat lease bonus and advance royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.501" offset="4637946">However, in 1974 during the prior Congress, indeed the last session of the prior Congress and merely four months prior to the date that the conference committee announced the final Section 613A compromise, the House considered legislation that had been proposed by Wilbur Mills then the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee that is strikingly similar to Section 613A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.614" offset="4750377">That legislation provided a percentage depletion deduction that was permissible again with respect to so much of the taxpayers average daily production of domestic crude oil as in that bill did not exceed 3000 barrels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.874" offset="4811503">Average daily production in that legislation was defined precisely as it is defined in Section 613A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.169" offset="4840656">When that bill was reported out of committee the House Ways and Means Committee made the only statement that is directly relevant to the appropriate disposition of this case, and the House committee's report states thus the deduction applies to gross income attributable to oil which is sold or removed from the premises and not to other types of depletable income.</text>

            <text syncTime="1244.388" offset="5125495">That is directly inconsistent with Herring, and it is clear that Congress meant to change the rules that income alone was no longer the basis for percentage depletion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1870.419" offset="7629593">First, the conference said we are going to keep percentage depletion at 22 percent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.712" offset="7978798">I represent the Engles who are the Respondents in No. 82-599.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.258" offset="8000950">The Engles received $7600 in advance royalties in 1975, a year in which there was no production in the sense of physical extraction from the oil and gas properties that were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.876" offset="8063435">The Engles nevertheless claimed under the independent producer exemption Section 613A(c) of the Revenue Code which was added under the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 the percentage depletion allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.040" offset="8140130">The Tax Court decided against the Engles' position finding that the statute had overruled the decision of the Herring case and required production, that is, that the payment must be directly related to production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.079" offset="8224244">The Seventh Circuit reversed finding that there was no production requirement imposed by the statute but rather that the statute imposed a limitation only on the amount that would be eligible for the deduction in effect defining who is the small independent producer that was to have available to him a continuing percentage depletion allowance though Congress had intended to eliminate the depletion allowance for the large oil company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.546" offset="8386099">It is the Engles' position that the language in Section 613A which requires the deduction to be computed in accordance with Section 613 requires that the deduction be based only on gross income from the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.538" offset="8470109">The advance royalties are gross income from the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.848" offset="8487350">There is nothing in Section 613A that says that the deduction is to be calculated on the value of production, and Mr. Phillips' position would suggest that the calculation is to be based on the value of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.967" offset="8547849">Since we contend that prior law was to be retained for the small independent producer, a brief summary of prior law would be in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.742" offset="8606886">Under the Herring case there was no production requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.804" offset="8627157">Lease bonus and advance royalties were eligible for percentage depletion in the same manner as the proceeds of actual extraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.424" offset="8673655">There was a recapture rule I think that has been referred to before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.858" offset="8707405">If by the termination of the lease there had not been production sufficient to justify the advance royalty or lease bonus, then under the tax benefit rule the amount of depletion previously claimed would be recaptured.</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.138" offset="12740502">It is because Congress wanted to tell us that we wanted to go back to 613.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.558" offset="12762236">We want all of the law, the regulations, the baggage, the decisions of this Court including Herring in order that we can see when we go to the limitation that Congress meant for this Court to look and meant for the administration of the Internal Revenue Service to look at what it has said before over a period of 50 years with respect to Section 611 through Section 613.</text>

            <text syncTime="3292.175" offset="13316659">But why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.220" offset="13324809">It was because the statute, the bill in the prior Congress was exactly the same and the legislative report was exactly the same word for word.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.818" offset="13447271">Therefore, we respectfully submit that it had absolutely no support for going back into a prior Congress as to a bill that was never enacted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3660.917" offset="14791637">I would hope, of course, the Court would, yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.900" offset="14803549">Lastly, we would respectfully call the attention of the Court to the fact that the Farmars and the Suggs had actual production during the year of the receipt of their bonus and so there is absolutely nothing in the statute that says that they cannot combine these two types of gross incomes from the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.672" offset="14894664">The gross income that is truly gross income from the property in the form of a bonus and the dollars they receive from the percentage royalty, I put the two together and take their percentage depletion upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.150" offset="14952551">You can easily combine them and see whether or not the limitation had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.819" offset="14975226">So, therefore, we have an even, simplistic method of applying the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.925" offset="15011692">What the taxpayers here are suggesting conform with all of the decisions, the mosaic, almost Grecian mosaic that this Court worked out with respect to percentage depletion on bonuses over a very long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.543" offset="15078148">It conforms with what Congress intended for the small producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.260" offset="15101031">It is simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.479" offset="15105838">It is logical, and the taxpayers should prevail.</text>

            <text syncTime="3776.965" offset="15255781">Yes, sir, but then it would have to be spread over the large production if I understand the question correctly in the later years and it would immediately violate the 3000 or 2000 barrel limit and you would immediately in the next year restore a part of the depletion deduction to income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.688" offset="15362674">In other words, you estimate your recoverable reserves, Your Honor, and then you spread that... Say you are going to get 1000 barrels... I mean a million since we are dealing with big figures a million barrels a year for the next ten years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3821.978" offset="15435921">So you spread your bonus over that ten years proportionately, and if you take your bonus and spread it to the next year and see how many dollars you are getting for that production you immediately are able to see that you have gone over in the second year your 2000 barrel limitation and so in the second year you immediately restore the depletion you took in the first year back to income.</text>
