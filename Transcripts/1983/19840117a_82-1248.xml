            <text syncTime="43.761" offset="324216">The principal question presented is whether a New York State Family Court judge violates the due process clause when he detains an accused juvenile delinquent after he has conducted a detention hearing and after he has found, based on facts and reasons elicited at that hearing that there is a serious risk that the juvenile, if released, will commit a pre-trial crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.785" offset="416272">When the judge acts in this premise, he relies on specific statutory authority, namely, Section 320.5(3)(b) of New York's Family Court Act, which is the statute involved in this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.693" offset="471965">The appeal is from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and it arises in the proceedings brought by detained juveniles for a class writ of habeas corpus and for a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.782" offset="520239">I will address Section 320.5(3)(b) and related provisions of Article 3 initially and I do so both to inform the Court about the procedural constraints that New York imposes on the judicial decision to detain an accused delinquent prior to trial and to rebut at the same time several alleged deficiencies in this procedures which were assigned to it in the opinions below and are noted by Appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.141" offset="637686">I will then turn to Appellees' two principal arguments under Mathews versus Eldridge, namely, that some crimes must be excluded from Section 320.5(3)(b) and that some guidelines for judicial decision making must be added so that the statute would survive scrutiny under the due process clause--</text>

            <label>Ms. Judith A. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="155.033" offset="769238">In New York... New York provides bail for adults and does not have a preventive detention statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.717" offset="795988">It has been noted, however, that New York's bail law generally does take at least some account of future crime in the community if that is your point.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.143" offset="837679">Of course Your Honor is aware that the District of Columbia itself does have a preventive detention statute which was cert denied in United States versus Edwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.630" offset="875714">I believe it was the term before last.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.610" offset="883550">And, we suggest... we contend... that our statute is identical in all material respects to Edwards and, accordingly, would pass muster in the same manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.958" offset="924928">Appellees do make one other argument other than their Mathews argument and that is that pre-trial detention to prevent crime as distinguished from pre-trial detention to assure appearance at trial is constitutional punishment and we have addressed that argument in our reply brief at pages 1 through 11.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.032" offset="1137252">--We would suggest, Your Honor, that there are two separate constitutional limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.945" offset="1156896">One is quite important and one you have heard a great deal about today and that the Fourth Amendment and probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.550" offset="1183332">That is not quite... Well, probable cause is noted by Appellees in the course of their discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.634" offset="1207678">They have not really made a separate Fourth Amendment challenge.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="267.876" offset="1220634">Do you think that is a requirement, probable cause?</text>

          <turn speaker="judith_a_gordon" startTime="270.147" stopTime="313.575">
            <label>Ms. Judith A. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="270.147" offset="1229725">I think that probable cause in the sense of Gerstein, which we believe is met under this statute, and in the sense of New York's further requirement that there be an adversarial probable cause hearing for these juvenile, which the prosecution has the burden, that that probable cause requirement is well met in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.682" offset="1315825">We do not suggest that an affirmative finding of probable cause must be present at the time of detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.568" offset="1343410">In other words, it is sufficient in our view that it is provided and the child be given an opportunity to negative it at the time of detention and that it is there after found based on the prosecutor's burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.213" offset="1390012">In other words, it need not be simultaneously affirmatively found.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="313.575" stopTime="315.548">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="313.575" offset="1403492">Is there any other constitutional limitations?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="judith_a_gordon" startTime="315.548" stopTime="497.117">
            <label>Ms. Judith A. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="315.548" offset="1411328">Yes, Your Honor, absolutely, and that arises from the existence of the detention or perhaps if you want to call it conversely, the release statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.773" offset="1448213">And, that statute has a due process relation in the same sense as any other statute that creates an interest in property or liberty would have a due process relation.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.870" offset="1496592">And the appropriate test for that statute is the Mathews versus Eldridge test and it involves both considerations of it permissibility under the due process clause and the appropriate measure of the process that is due which is exactly the issue we addressed in this case, the principal issue we addressed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.224" offset="1574019">Returning to the statutory scheme, I think it is significant that we know, first of all, who the person is or who the child is that is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.859" offset="1608605">And, the juvenile, according to New York law is... the juvenile delinquent under New York law is an individual who commits an act between the ages of 7 and 16 which, if done by an adult, would be a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.291" offset="1666283">Under Section 302.2 of the Family Court Act, the Family Court's jurisdiction is not quite so confined.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.615" offset="1703586">A juvenile who has done that conduct within the 7 to 16 age range may be prosecuted in the Family Court until he is 20 if a designated felony is involved or until he is 18 if another felony or misdemeanor is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.727" offset="1772027">A designated felony is... We provide a list of them for you at page 6 of our brief in the second footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.250" offset="1798149">It is essentially a list of crimes allocated by age which permit a Family Court judge sitting at disposition, which is the analog of sentencing, to give an initial placement period of three to five years which is somewhat higher than the 12 to 18 month initial placement period that is available for other crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.255" offset="1886130">The place at which... The proceeding at which detention may be considered is called an initial appearance and if a child has been detained on an emergency basis by an admitting detention authority, who is represented here today by the New York City Department of Juvenile Justice which is administered by Appellant, if he has been admitted to such an agency on an emergency basis, this initial appearance where detention may be considered, must be on the next court day and never set more than 72 hours later.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.548" offset="2027296">If the child has not been detained, in other words he has been released by the police after his arrest, his initial appearance is within ten days.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.064" offset="2069405">And, I call your attention to a new provision of the statute, noting parenthetically that this juvenile delinquency procedural code was recently amended and all the amendments became effective last July.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.983" offset="2121127">And, there are some differences between the new law and the old law and this is one of the differences.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="497.117" stopTime="500.120">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="497.117" offset="2137637">Is the probable cause standard the same?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="judith_a_gordon" startTime="500.120" stopTime="574.097">
            <label>Ms. Judith A. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="500.120" offset="2149653">The probable cause standard is exactly the same, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.480" offset="2159057">There is one difference, however, the police, on releasing the child, must give him an appearance ticket and the appearance ticket now must provide that in a designated felony he must return to court within 72 hours and in other cases, crimes charged, he must return within 14 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.663" offset="2239828">This makes some difference in looking at the opinions below and in noting Appellees' brief, because one of the assignments of error in this case is that somehow the police decision to release a child rather than detain him or bring him directly to the court, made, according to the district judge and Appellees, the judge's decision, who was sitting in that court later, error because he decided to detain him and the gap in time between the time the child was originally arrested and released and ultimately appeared in court and when detained was' pointed out as an inadequacy in the statute, although, of course, it relies on the police decision and not on the judge's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.942" offset="2408892">In any event, the new provision of the law now restricts the time limit the child could possibly be on the street if the police arrest him.</text>

            <text syncTime="583.535" offset="2483289">I don't know whether they are stronger, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.525" offset="2491230">I think they are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.285" offset="2498336">And, essentially they are as follows: Let us assume that a state has an interest, a preventing crime interest, which is universal.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.075" offset="2549431">It applies to adults, it applies to juveniles.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.468" offset="2563015">The state has, with respect to that juvenile, another interest which I would submit to you it does not have, at least in the same form that it has with respect to the juvenile, and that is child protective interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.376" offset="2622678">It is concern that a child at the formative stages of his life not be engaged in a series of criminal acts, lest that kind of anti-social behavior harm him normative development.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.037" offset="2685268">And, related to that, that he should not be engaged in those criminal acts lest he actually become physically harmed by them, namely, a police officer shoots him.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.445" offset="2730930">The liquor store that he is holding up, the individual, the owner, not realizing that he is only 14, thinking he is 18, acts immediately and harms him.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.419" offset="2770845">New York has those interests in the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.582" offset="2779518">In that sense, it has its parents' patria interest which--</text>

            <text syncTime="665.467" offset="2810969">--I am sorry, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.038" offset="2821314">The point I was trying to make was that the state has an interest in keeping the child harm free, and while it may have some interest in that with respect to adults, it has a stronger interest with respect to the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.757" offset="2880141">That is the only point.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.999" offset="2885157">In addition, Your Honor, we would also say that the child's pre-trial interest in liberty is not the same as an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.393" offset="2914727">The essence of being a child, of being an unemancipated minor is dependence and custodial status.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.909" offset="2948791">Obviously, an adult does not have an absolute right to freedom, that is certainly true, but he certainly has a higher right than the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.584" offset="2979511">So, those interests in relation make what I would submit to you is a match in favor of the state interest in preventive detention, pre-trial preventive detention for juveniles, which match might not turn out to be the same if one carried the analog to the adult, to adult pre-trial--</text>

I think we have at least touched upon the first Mathews argument that Appellees advance which goes to this balancing of interest that I was elaborating for the Chief Justice before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.607" offset="5731563">We believe that there are at least... In addition to their failure recess the second child protective interest that is involved in the statute, and their failure to note that there is a distinction between a juvenile's interest in pre-trial liberty and an adult's interest in pre-trial liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.890" offset="5804706">When Appellees press this analysis they get to a third error which is perhaps the most pervasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.613" offset="5827589">And, that is since they hypothecate that some group of crimes must be excluded from this prevention detention statute and they characterize them as trivial crime, but they never define what kinds of crimes they mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.102" offset="5889552">Their weighing of the state interest and the juvenile's interest in these crimes that are to be excluded is, in fact, a false weighing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.163" offset="5937826">In other words, without knowing what kinds of crimes Appellees have in mind, they never can assess the importance of the state's interest in including them in a detention standard, nor from the juvenile's interest in pre-trial liberty in excluding them from the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.011" offset="6009193">So, that when they say that the juvenile's interest outweighs the state's interest, they really have not made the requisite comparison or the one that Mathews requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.980" offset="6053078">In addition, the suggestion that some group of crimes should be excluded from the statute turns out to be, on the testimony of their own witness, the criminologist below, to yield a worse statute than the statute that is now on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.043" offset="6133327">It yields a worse statute because, as their witness testified, the more you qualify crimes, the more you require that somebody predict a specific crime, which you would necessarily have to do to exclude crime, the worse your prediction becomes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.764" offset="6200200">In other words, your error rate increases with every adjective or modification and with every particularization.</text>

            <text syncTime="1598.209" offset="6541986">And that is that we have said, said at the outset of this case that it is not guidelines for the decision making that will make this statute constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.689" offset="6595903">It is the facts and reasons requirement and the stenographic record which is the requirement that takes a standard and translates it to a particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.010" offset="6657134">In other words, the stenographic record and the facts and reasons requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.919" offset="6668837">We said that Kent versus the United States established that proposition and we adhere to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.203" offset="6693914">The converse proposition that Appellees are arguing, namely, that guidelines for decision making, as opposed to the facts and reasons requirement, somehow are the thing that makes the statute constitutional, finds no warrant in the law, and they cite us to no case which says that guidelines, whether administrative or judicially... quasi judicially created in a legislative capacity of a judiciary body, are what make the law constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.996" offset="6821078">There is no case like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.756" offset="6828184">Now, I think if we follow in terms of logic exactly what results from guidelines as opposed to from facts and reasons we have to conclude that what the court said in Kent, namely, it is facts and reasons and not guidelines, that that is the appropriate standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.450" offset="6902894">And, I point out the following: We cited in our opening brief the prefatory nature of guidelines for bail decisions, not the Federal Bail Statute and the New York Bail Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.178" offset="6965901">Appellees don't challenge us on that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.511" offset="6979172">They agree apparently that these are prefatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.114" offset="6993591">What is prefatory, Your Honor, seems to me cannot possibly be constitutionally mandated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.617" offset="7023580">Second, the existence of guidelines in no way translates itself into the decision making process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.605" offset="7059524">For example, if I were to take the seven general considerations that Judge Quinones testified were common in making these decisions and distribute them widely to every judge... every Family Court judge in New York State, I would nonetheless be unable by that distribution to guarantee that any judge would not write on his record, to use the classic law school example, the boy was wearing a red tie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.534" offset="7183240">In other words, the guidelines themselves don't make the judge do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.257" offset="7202153">Now, certainly the facts and reasons requirement can result in an error here and there, but certainly that requirement, the translation of the standard to the record, is what protects the juvenile from unfettered discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.716" offset="7260040">Indeed, the guidelines allows exactly the same kind of subjective decision making that Appellees are arguing against because they don't won't the judge to do anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="3502.367" offset="14158561">We believe as a basic point that if this Court does not find that this statute violates due process of law, it almost certainly does not violate equal protection of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.915" offset="14204850">We have abandoned that claim at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.375" offset="14214672">We think that the heart of our case is that this statute cannot withstand scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.001" offset="14237137">We think as a bottom-line point detention before trial for the purposes envisioned by this statute offend for other reasons the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.537" offset="14279247">It is not necessary for the the Court to decide this case to reach that other issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.871" offset="14308608">But, if it is to reach that other issue, we submit that this is a classic example of utilizing the statute in the wrong way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.062" offset="14369421">Most of the juveniles who are detained are ultimately released home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.116" offset="14389588">The vast bulk are released home and half are never even convicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3577.358" offset="14458551">There is no Article 3 case or controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.349" offset="14474538">I have litigated this case in different manner since 1973 in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.945" offset="14504945">Now, when you come into the federal court to challenge this, if you don't have a class action, your clients group up and they grow out of the age... This isn't even a Hunt v. Roth case where you can say, well, when you are released from prison, you may ultimately be rearrested assuming you don't get life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.536" offset="14583312">Here, when they are 16, they are out of the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.109" offset="14597627">It is incapable of repetition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.210" offset="14605986">It is only by the device of class action that we can litigate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.424" offset="14622809">And, the identity of the plaintiff is relevant only to the inquiry, I submit, of whether a class action is properly certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.881" offset="14660634">Once it is properly certified, and in this case it would be all juveniles eligible for detention, then the "Three Card Monte" detainee is as important an example as the Martin example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.829" offset="14716432">We have evidence in this record that judges base their decision to detain on the political climate of the situation, of how much media attention a case gets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.467" offset="14763034">One judge's policy, perfectly lawful under this statute, reviewable by writ or otherwise, to detain all juveniles who are accused of an offense in which a gun was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.725" offset="14812040">That is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.135" offset="14817683">Now, that may be lawful with a statute which has a showing of a standard of proof and a probable cause and likelihood of conviction and other protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.254" offset="14862195">This statute lacks all of the essential protections which the Constitution requires in the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.269" offset="14894169">What is nice about this case, if I may, is that affirmance is going to improve a system of justice which this Court on numerous occasions has condemned for its failure to live up to its ultimate promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.781" offset="14976298">What is wrong with juvenile justice in part, this Court has noted on many occasions, is that it fails to deter and it often fails to rehabilitate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.700" offset="15023945">Every major study of juvenile justice shows in full conformity with this record that the vast majority of juveniles are punished, if at all, before their trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3772.766" offset="15240239">I am saying that this Court can comfortably affirm in the knowledge that it will result in fewer juveniles being punished before their trial, but not in fewer juveniles being detained when there is a need to bring them to court for their trial when there is a risk of flight because they are eligilbe for detention under a statute not being charged.</text>
