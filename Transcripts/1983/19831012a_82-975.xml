            <text syncTime="189.276" offset="905284">The City is regulating the attachment of signs on these utility poles and on their appurtenances for public policy reasons, for traffic safety reasons, for reasons of safety to workers who need to climb the poles in order to repair wires and other equipment at the top of the poles and for the purpose of eliminating to the extent that is possible visual clutter which is directly caused by signs that proliferate on these utility poles, on the cross bars, on city street lighting systems and on numerous others of these items of property most of which are public property which are located on and along the streets and the sidewalks.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.250" offset="1185212">There were a number of candidates for this office, at least two, Mr. Vincent and I believe another nonincumbent who was elected to the City Council in that district.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.159" offset="1240800">There are 15 City Council districts, and in half of the years half of the members run.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.427" offset="1281865">In some of the years we also have a number of city-wide offices which run and there are, of course, always several candidates for various of these offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.512" offset="1330244">So there are a number of candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.284" offset="1337349">Signs, of course, are posted not only by candidates and those who support them but also by others who have both political and nonpolitical messages that they want displayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.233" offset="1385101">We have those who espouse viewpoints, positions on public issues and of course we have those who put up signs for commercial purposes, those who want to invite people to their disco or their dance or to tell them where they can find the latest built condominium for sale and those who have garage sales and those who have merely lost their pets and want them returned if someone finds them.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.091" offset="1500562">So we see attached to all of these objects many different kinds of signs not only political signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.366" offset="1525639">In fact the record indicates that probably the vast majority of the signs that are attached are nonpolitical commercial signs.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.260" offset="1669208">These signs attached to these cross wires will generally not affect the safety of the workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.735" offset="1695122">However, if you look at the picture on page 136 you will see that the sign is located very, very close to the upright pole, and it is certainly possible that if the sign is attached that close to the pole that a worker climbing the pole might hit his foot on the sign and lose balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.622" offset="1794701">But generally speaking signs on these cross bars do not cause a problem for the workers who climb the pole.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.097" offset="1828555">They cause other problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.800" offset="1835452">They may very well regardless of their size hide a traffic hazard and certainly they not only add to the visual clutter but as the district court found they encourage others to post signs in other unsightly places and in that way add to the proliferation.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.864" offset="1927612">One of the problems which the City faces especially a city like Los Angeles which is so large, the third largest city in the nation with regard to population, one of the largest with regard to its size... There are 465 square miles approximately of the city and over 6,400 miles of streets and roadways along which all of these signs are located.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.452" offset="2042028">These are a great number of signs, a great number of objects on which signs can be posted and on which signs are posted.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.719" offset="2075047">You have all of these objects with signs on them.</text>

            <text syncTime="965.755" offset="4011243">They were erected either so that the City could string its utility wires along the streets in a convenient place or with regard to the lighting system so that the streets could be lit for safety purposes or with regard to posts and poles that are erected for the purpose of displaying the City's own traffic and street information, information about where the City streets are, what street someone may be driving on, how fast that person can drive, where that person can park or not park.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.130" offset="4164738">They were not erected for the purpose of giving to private individuals the right to put up any signs that they wanted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1027.075" offset="4256480">The City's ordinance prohibits their use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.366" offset="4273617">The City contends that an item of government property cannot by tradition become a public forum unless it is legitimately used as a public forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.099" offset="4332549">Here these objects have never been legitimately used as a public forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="3560.213" offset="14389065">It may be anywhere from 18 up to a larger number.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.670" offset="14426890">In 1969 for the first time candidates ran for seven districts of a community college board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.276" offset="14473284">There were more than 100 candidates who ran for those positions so that there can very well be quite a large number of candidates running in city elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.398" offset="14541829">We also need to understand that in the even numbered years candidates are running for county office, state legislative office, state-wide office, congressional office and for president and vice president.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.418" offset="14605881">We know that in a city as large as Los Angeles there quite a number of legislative districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.182" offset="14628973">There are quite a number of candidates who are running.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.264" offset="14641303">This is not just a phenomenon that creeps up every time we have a city election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.788" offset="14659380">It also is a phenomenon that we have every time we have a state-wide or national election, and it is a phenomenon that we have all of the time because not only do we have candidates we have people with other views and we have people with commercial messages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.860" offset="14731687">Indeed, these signs are not self-regulating as we know because there are indeed so many of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.534" offset="14762302">Indeed because there are so many of them and because the city is so large and spread out and there are so many roadways and objects on which these signs can be attached there is really no way in which the city can reasonably and effectively regulate any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.715" offset="14831057">If we found that there are... Let's say that the City was to say that you could have one sign on every three poles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.779" offset="14863344">The City does not believe that is reasonable for one reason at least because what if the City finds three signs on one pole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.155" offset="14892810">How in the world is the City going to know which sign was there first and, therefore, which two signs the City could remove?</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.160" offset="14924888">Is the City required to hold a hearing as to thousands of poles where it finds more than one sign on those poles in order to determine which sign was entitled to be there?</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.317" offset="14969506">Certainly that cannot be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.591" offset="14978596">Certainly any other regulation would be unreasonable, unworkable, unpoliceable, would impose terrific and expensive administrative burdens on the City.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.386" offset="15021751">The Court should well recognize that in this area the City of Los Angeles is not like the City of San Francisco that the City of Los Angeles believes that it needs different regulations because of conditions that are specific to the City of Los Angeles which is certainly much larger and much more populous and much different from the City of San Francisco that the City of Los Angeles ought to be entitled to pick those means which it believes will best solve its problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.089" offset="15156542">As long as the City is not limiting speech so that there are no alternative channels of communication and so long as it is not saying to one candidate I will let you put up your signs and to another candidate I will not let you put up your sign, if it is not doing that then the City ought to be entitled to enforce, to enact and keep and enforce this regulation especially because those objects which the City prohibits signs on are not a public forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.770" offset="15291334">This Court ought to reverse the decision of the Ninth Circuit which found the ordinance unconstitutional on its face and granted summary judgment on the constitutional issue to the Plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.788" offset="15347341">For the reasons that we cited in our briefs and the arguments today, the City submits that its ordinance is unconstitutional and urges this Court to reverse the decision of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
