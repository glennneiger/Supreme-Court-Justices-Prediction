            <text syncTime="114.172" offset="587717">This is so because the jury was not given options in its guilt deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.612" offset="617497">The one option that the jury did have, the sentencing verdict it did choose to exercise, and that was overriden by a judge that was not... the judge that was not privy to the guilt deliberations of the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.919" offset="1086761">The question as to whether a new trial is required was not settled in Beck, but the logic of Beck would indicate that a new trial is required, because the harm in Beck was the harm of a distorted fact finding at a time when the defendant's life was at stake.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.226" offset="1227926">But the first issue is the Beck issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.063" offset="1247257">It involves an application of the Court's decision in Beck v. Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.133" offset="1275574">The Court held in Beck that the death sentence, very simply, may not be imposed, consistent with the Constitution, where it is imposed after a verdict of quilt of a capital offense, where the jury had no other options other than acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.082" offset="1367420">The Court reasoned that such a situation puts pressure on the jury, if you will, that threatens the efficacy of the reasonable doubt standard in that guilt determination, so much so that in a capital case, that risk can't be tolerated; that the risk of an unwarranted conviction is just too great.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.048" offset="1471283">Therefore, in Beck, where the Alabama legislature had passed a statute preventing the jury from considering lesser offenses, that procedure was held to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.473" offset="1520916">Similarly, in Keeble, where the Court was faced with the prosecution of an Indian, and there was no jurisdiction in the lower court over lesser offenses for an Indian, the Court determined that nevertheless there was error.</text>

            <text syncTime="478.425" offset="2044723">See, our position is premised on the fact that a jury is the fact finder that returns a verdict and tells us essentially what offense has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.250" offset="2096028">And the statute of limitations, especially in Florida, is a separate legal decision that the judge can make.</text>

            <text syncTime="505.093" offset="2151407">Well, but if the theory of a lesser included offense charge is that the jury may be willing, in a doubtful case, may be willing to find someone guilty of a lesser included offense rather than a greater offense, if they think they have that option, rather than just the option between acquitting and finding guilty of the greater offense, isn't it a little inconsistent to give the jury the impression that they can return a verdict of guilty on this lesser offense, and that there will be punishment for it when, in fact, there can't be any?</text>

            <label>Mr. Craig S. Barnard</label>
            <text syncTime="537.964" offset="2282855">My answer is that I believe that it would not mislead the jury to instruct on the lesser offenses, because if the jury were instructed on the offense... the lesser offenses... determined, as juries do, what offense has been committed, and if it was the lesser offense, it would be doing precisely what a jury should be doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.250" offset="2404064">The judge would then determine the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.054" offset="2419215">But there are other options.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.672" offset="2429768">If it is believed that that would mislead the jury too much, the State has other options, one of which is to change its statute of limitations, which, incidentally, Florida has since done.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.663" offset="2485670">There are a number of options to get around the harm identified in Beck, which is simply the unavailability to that jury of the lesser offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1798.178" offset="7323757">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.630" offset="7337549">Mr. Spaziano has presented three claims here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.248" offset="7352073">The first, of course, is the claim that he's entitled to some relief from his tactical decision at trial to send this case to the jury on an all-or-nothing basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.139" offset="7395646">I think, in addressing this issue, we have to start right off by discovering who did what to whom here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.809" offset="7422290">And the fact is that it was Mr. Spaziano who went to the Court, who said to the judge, if I did this thing, I ought to be killed, and then whose attorney went to the jury in closing argument, and he said, look, folks, here's this man accused of first degree murder, here's this man who's accusing him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.755" offset="7498046">And then he said, in a classic golden rule argument, he said would you want your life in the hands of Mr. Dilisio, who is a drug user and a reprobate, and who knows what else?</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.514" offset="7549141">It was a very strong argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.847" offset="7558441">It led to the jury being out for a great length of time before returning a guilty verdict, but the fact is, it was Mr. Spaziano's strategic choice to hit the jury right between the eyes with this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.774" offset="7610163">And, having gambled and lost, he wants another roll of the dice up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.642" offset="7625628">And we don't think it's fair to the State of Florida to have constant retrials while defendants tests their alternate defense theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.998" offset="7654989">And that's basically what they're asking for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.784" offset="7666170">The statute of limitations defense is not a constitutional defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.836" offset="7682366">It is a statutory defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.938" offset="7690829">It was set up by the State of Florida, and it was placed in the hands of defendants in criminal cases to use as they see fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.107" offset="7723430">That's the whole thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.376" offset="7732521">Mr. Spaziano chose not to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.495" offset="7740984">Somebody else might choose to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.863" offset="7750493">The very fact that he can use it as a bargaining chip does not render constitutionally suspect this proceeding, any more than a waiver of speedy trial would, or a guilty plea would, where he would waive his right to jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.421" offset="7800753">There is simply no constitutional problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.790" offset="7814232">Mr. Spaziano, in fact, thought so little of this argument that he didn't even appeal it to the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.627" offset="7841504">What he did was, he filed his brief, and then when the Beck decision cane out, he sent it up as supplemental authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.448" offset="7864805">So it didn't even dawn on him that his rights had been so horrendously violated until someone told him about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.370" offset="7892495">On the jury override question, we would submit right off the bat, this is not a jury override case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.226" offset="7927917">There was a Gardner remand here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.592" offset="7937425">The first time this case cane up for cert to this Court, the Florida Supreme Court had decided to remand the case for resentencing pursuant to Gardner, because what had happened was, the original trial jury was not told that Mr. Spaziano had committed three other murders, four bombings, and then had raped a girl in Orlando and cut her eyes out so she couldn't testify against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.108" offset="8031466">And there were some other cases where his fellow members of the Outlaws Motorcycle Gang had scared off the witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2308.853" offset="9366428">What is the rationale for the death penalty, for Florida's death penalty?</text>

            <text syncTime="2318.644" offset="9405611">But the fact is that... not to be facetious... but the fact is there are three prongs, okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.965" offset="9430898">There is the fact that society has to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.933" offset="9446780">In Mr. Spaziano's case, perhaps 12 murders, 4 bombings, who knows how many rapes, okay.</text>

            <text syncTime="2342.593" offset="9501428">No, because the murders go on in prison, and there is a real and present danger to prison guards and other inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.144" offset="9523580">The second one is the deterrence factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.614" offset="9537477">We do know that... well, we'll never know how many people don't commit murder because they might get the chair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.535" offset="9569138">We do know, again, that the recidivism rate for executed prisoners is zero, and that... and if one life is saved that way, that's fine with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.624" offset="9601530">It's worth it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.558" offset="9605291">And the third factor, of course, is so miniscule as to be nonexistent, but counsel refers to the retribution factor, which it's discussed, but I personally don't accept it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.366" offset="9652521">Basically, it's the protection of society and the prevention of future murders.</text>

            <text syncTime="2404.916" offset="9750741">If I might digress, there was an article recently... there was a column by Jim Kilpatrick, regarding the fact that the federal system does not have a death penalty, and how two prisoners here in Washington, D.C. were trying to get into the Aryan Brotherhood, and to get in they had to kill somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.061" offset="9823257">And all that could happen to them... they killed two prison guards in the space of an hour... and all the Federal Government could do was return them to their cell, because they were already under a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.852" offset="9870486">This is what I mean when I say that we look at it in terms of protecting society, including the society within the prison walls.</text>

            <text syncTime="2484.396" offset="10068599">There are actually two bodies that were discovered, but only one that they could piece together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.967" offset="10082914">Mr. Spaziano's modus operandi was to dismember his victims while they were still alive, and then scatter the parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.870" offset="10110499">They could not find any evidence directly linking Mr. Spaziano to the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.726" offset="10141951">The prosecution did not commence from the record, only because they did not have enough information to get an indictment or information until the time they finally did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.348" offset="10180403">They had Mr. Dilisio's ramblings in the jail, but I would agree with the defense; he was not the most reliable individual in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.668" offset="10209765">I wouldn't go and put someone in jail on a first degree murder charge, just based on something he said, without getting some corroboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.072" offset="10235365">It was not our fault that Mr. Spaziano avoided arrest for two years, and he shouldn't benefit from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.226" offset="10259920">Now, under the old... this case came up under Florida's old limitations statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.629" offset="10289595">Under the new statute, the limitations problem would not exist, because when a defendant avoids arrest, the statute of limitations is told.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.651" offset="10321673">But, unfortunately, this was under our old statute where, if you just hid out for two years, you could get away with murder.</text>

            <label>Mr. Craig S. Barnard</label>
            <text syncTime="2565.613" offset="10393458">Very briefly, just to clear up some facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.934" offset="10414774">Justice Stevens's question regarding overruling a death verdict, judges overruling a death verdict... those statistics are not kept, but there are some indications in our certiorari petition... the petition itself... we had attached an appendix which set out some of those statistics from data done by... collected by Linda Foley, Professor Foley, who has done a study.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.751" offset="10526055">That data reports... and again, it's set out in the certiorari petition appendix... that where death is involved, either the jury or the judge is thinking about death, or has decided on death, the disagreement is about 6 percent the judge would impose life or the jury would impose death; in 28 percent, where the jury would impose and then the judge imposes death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.222" offset="10647890">So the disagreement is quite vast there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.622" offset="10657504">About avoiding detection, that is, of course, not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.213" offset="10699926">The... all that's required in Florida is that the State file an arrest warrant, and that tolls the statute of limitations, so there is absolutely no indication in this record at all that Joe Spaziano was avoiding detection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.605" offset="10749455">We would ask the Court to require a new trial under Beck v. Alabama or to require the imposition of a life sentence consistent with what the jury has said.</text>
