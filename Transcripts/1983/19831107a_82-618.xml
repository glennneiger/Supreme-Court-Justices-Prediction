            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="135840">We will hear arguments first this morning in Kosak against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.326" offset="161127">Mr. Naftulin, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Naftulin</label>
            <text syncTime="8.826" offset="171053">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.183" offset="184532">When we got back Mr. Kosak's oriental and art collection in its damaged condition, we had a decision we had to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.349" offset="233224">Could we force the government or get some kind of trial to make the government pay for the damage that they did to Mr. Kosak's collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.689" offset="274498">We came up with one viable alternative in which we could file a suit and that was the claim under the Federal Torts Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.811" offset="311069">This case comes down to a case of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.356" offset="329251">Eventually we reached the point of just determining the exact language of an exemption in the statute, but before I get to that exact language, which should be the starting point, there are a couple of principles which I think this Court should keep in mind and that is the Federal Torts Claims Act itself which gave the citizens the right to sue the government for negligence in the same way as if they were suing a private individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.813" offset="443040">There is one main reason... There is one main area in which we disagreed with the Third Circuit and that is whether the waiver of sovereign immunity was a broad concept or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.323" offset="505107">We took the position that sovereign immunity... That the Federal Torts Claims Act waived sovereign immunity broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.555" offset="538021">The Third Circuit said, no, that this was just a narrow restriction and our position was that they were misreading the teachings of this Court, although they accused us of doing the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.734" offset="598730">When Congress passed the Federal Torts Claims Act, they did it for several reasons, one being that the prevalent feeling at that time was that it should be fundamental to a democracy that an individual who is injured should not be deprived of redress merely because that injury was caused by the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.772" offset="702906">I thought democracy was the idea that the majority rules and that if the majority decides that a person can't sue the government, that certainly is perfectly democratic, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="192.844" offset="907184">Isn't that your problem?</text>

            <text syncTime="195.061" offset="916065">On the face of it that seems... What happened here was there was a detention of your client's goods or merchandise by an officer of Customs, wasn't there?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="204.792" offset="954936">Then why doesn't that preclude recovery under that Act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_naftulin" startTime="208.932" stopTime="523.631">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Naftulin</label>
            <text syncTime="208.932" offset="971549">Okay, for the following reasons: First of all, the exemption should be narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.707" offset="1014599">Now, what we did was we approached it several different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.440" offset="1037587">The first way we used the exact words.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.954" offset="1051589">We went to the exact wording,</text>
            <text syncTime="231.640" offset="1062351">"any claim arising in respect of the detention. "</text>
            <text syncTime="237.294" offset="1084921">Now, we went to the dictionary definition of the words "in respect of".</text>
            <text syncTime="245.511" offset="1117835">We looked at several dictionary definitions, but what we say cited to the Court were the words that Judge Weis used in his dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.038" offset="1147928">They mean as to, as regards, insofar as concerns, with respect to.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.504" offset="1173842">I think if you just look at the words themselves, they are going to the fact of the detention itself and not something that arises during the detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.311" offset="1221071">Our first argument is the words itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.530" offset="1233923">The second one, okay, is that you have to look at all of the exemptions under 2680 and see the language that was used there.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.853" offset="1279167">The Customs exemption, 2680(c), is the only one that speaks in terms of in respect of, arising in respect of.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.052" offset="1320023">The others are all any claim arising out of that they are speaking of in terms of the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.923" offset="1347504">Any claim for damages, period, when they are talking about the operations of the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.343" offset="1377179">Any claim arising out of when they are talking the military or combatant activities, any claim arising in a foreign country, any claim arising from the Tennessee Valley Authority, any claim from with the Panama Canal Company, any claim arising from the activities of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.835" offset="1459099">There is a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.928" offset="1463487">There is a distinction in the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.818" offset="1475086">The exception for the Customs Service was the only one that used the words "in respect of".</text>
            <text syncTime="341.252" offset="1500790">Now, Congress spent 30 years writing this Act and what I submit to this Court is that there is a reason for this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.811" offset="1539033">As subtle as it might be, there is a reason for this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.606" offset="1554184">So, aside from the plain meaning of the words itself, you then have, looking at the entire Act itself... In fact, in the Second Circuit decision, in the Alliance case... The Alliance case analyzed the exception for the Postal Service which was any claiming arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.064" offset="1664003">It actually used the word "negligent", negligent transmission of letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.656" offset="1682393">And, the Alliance court's argument was, well, if the Customs Service was going to be excused for their negligence, that that wording would have gone into the statute as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.039" offset="1759925">There is a couple of other things, too, that I want to point out to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.146" offset="1780405">For instance, this Court made a decision in the case of United States versus Munez in which the Court ruled that the Federal Tort Claims Act did not bar a case against the United States for the negligence of a federal employee, namely, a prisoner worker, someone working in a prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.246" offset="1872774">Now, one of these exceptions here says it bars under 2680(h) any claim arising out of a false imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.977" offset="1911644">Now, go back to the Munez facts in which Mr. Munez was in prison and he was eventually beaten up in prison, he claimed, because of negligence of the guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.628" offset="1962322">Suppose Mr. Munez is put in the prison... that he is falsely in prison, that the government imprisoned the wrong Mr. Munez, all right?</text>
            <text syncTime="467.514" offset="2005894">Should that exemption, any claim arising out of false imprisonment now bar suit under these circumstances?</text>
            <text syncTime="478.353" offset="2049153">I think there is certain distinctions that are made in these exemptions and that these exemptions must be narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.116" offset="2080291">In fact, in the case of Block versus Neill, which was a decision by Justice Marshall, the government tried to assert the exemption, any claim arising out of the misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.779" offset="2154896">And, this Court again saw these distinctions and allowed the suit to be brought on another theory, on the good samaritan theory, because the government had agreed to undertake certain action in that case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="523.631" stopTime="533.315">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="523.631" offset="2230338">But, there the Court held that what the Plaintiff was suing on was not a misrepresentation, so it simply wasn't covered by that exception.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_naftulin" startTime="533.315" stopTime="552.136">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Naftulin</label>
            <text syncTime="533.315" offset="2268999">That is right, but it is still arguable that it is any claim arising out of the misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.686" offset="2302540">And, what I am saying... My point is that these exemptions should not be broadly construed, but they should be very narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.573" offset="2342038">In fact--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="554.384" offset="2353322">--Because of the reasons for the exemptions themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.834" offset="2387073">The exemptions are meant to prevent a harm to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.348" offset="2405149">If there is no harm to the government, then the exemption shouldn't bar the suit.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="574.205" offset="2432630">Well, that really doesn't make much sense to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.359" offset="2445273">I mean the exemption speaks for itself in its language and Congress has described in language what it thought might cause harm to the government in terms of allowing exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.746" offset="2486756">And, if the thing is within the language of the exemption, the fact that arguable there is no harm to the government in this case, I don't think would take it out of the exemption, do you?</text>

          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_naftulin" startTime="597.321" stopTime="642.927">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Naftulin</label>
            <text syncTime="597.321" offset="2525104">Well, I am not trying to tell you to take it out of the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.631" offset="2542344">It is a question of how you interpret the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.412" offset="2557391">If there is an exemption for this, then you just can't bring the suit and that is actually what you have to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.829" offset="2591141">But, if you went back to that Block versus Neill case, you could interpret it broadly of any act arising out of a misrepresentation or you can look at it much finer by saying, well, there is a second theory here on which to go to.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.713" offset="2666687">Therefore, that general language doesn't block the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.586" offset="2686122">There had to be a reason why Congress used the words "in respect to" here.</text>

            <text syncTime="663.920" offset="2791448">If you fit the exemption into the Act as a whole, hasn't the Court generally given the waiver a narrow interpretation?</text>

            <text syncTime="994.191" offset="4112513">He spoke about the Postal Service and he spoke about intentional torts and at that time he said as a policy matter the government should be free of all... free from suit, not situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1171.432" offset="4821476">We recognized the need for the Customs Service to be able to seize property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1180.336" offset="4857107">But, the reason why that is a necessity is so that it won't hinder them in what they are doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.707" offset="4890648">They should have free reign in being able to seize and detain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1206.701" offset="4962642">Customs seizes items which are very valuable, which are worth a lot of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.057" offset="4984062">In fact, in this particular case, there was an oriental clock, the equivalent of a grandfather clock, which they just decided it was too impossible for them to move that clock, that it definitely would have been damaged if they did that.</text>
