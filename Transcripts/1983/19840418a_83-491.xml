            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="160624">We will hear arguments first this morning in Immigration and Naturalization Service against Lopez-Mendoza.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.903" offset="188209">Mr. Frey, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="9.652" stopTime="109.342">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="9.652" offset="199181">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.085" offset="216944">The issue before the Court today is whether it should extend the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule heretofore applied by it only in the context of criminal prosecutions and quasi-criminal forfeiture proceedings to civil deportation hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.566" offset="278802">Respondents Lopez and Sandoval are Mexican nationals who entered the United States illegally nearly ten years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.139" offset="309104">Each was apprehended within a few months after his illegal entry by an INS agent at his place of employment, and each made admissions of his illegal alien status following his apprehension.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.355" offset="361976">These admissions were utilized at the deportation hearings to establish that respondents were not U.S. citizens, a fact that I might say is virtually impossible for the Immigration Service to prove by other means in cases of persons who enter the United States without inspection, and these admissions formed the basis of the decision ordering their deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.342" offset="453927">They appealed to the Court of Appeals and an en banc panel of the Ninth Circuit held that Sandoval's admission of his alien status was the fruit of an unlawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.651" offset="499171">As to respondent Lopez, it held that the record did not establish whether or not his arrest was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.257" offset="525607">It then turned to the question whether the exclusionary rule applies to deportation hearings, and concluding that it does, reversed the order of deportation with respect to Sandoval, and remanded for further proceedings with respect to Lopez.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.923" offset="584226">Now, let me begin my discussion by saying--</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="109.923" stopTime="110.828">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="110.828" offset="603870">--before you begin, respondent's brief has this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.217" offset="617453">"Contrary to the government's characterization of the decision below as extending the exclusionary rule to an entirely new category of cases and creating a new barrier to enforcement of immigration laws, it merely marks a return to long-standing former practice. "</text>
            <text syncTime="132.491" offset="690492">"Until 1979, the INS performed its investigative and prosecutorial functions in a legal regime in which the exclusionary rule was thought to apply. "</text>
            <text syncTime="143.205" offset="733437">It then goes on to say that really what you are asking is abandonment of the exclusionary rule after over 60 years of applicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.405" offset="770217">What do you say about that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="154.248" stopTime="201.246">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="154.248" offset="777532">Well, I guess I have two things to say about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.888" offset="788085">The first is that I am first addressing the question of this Court's jurisprudence and what it would mean in terms of this Court's jurisprudence to decide that the exclusionary rule is applicable to deportation proceedings, and as to that point, I think it is clear that it would be an extension in the sense that the Court has never applied the exclusionary rule to civil proceedings of any kind, and it has never applied the exclusionary rule to a non-punitive proceeding the purpose of which is to determine status.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.155" offset="913160">So, from the standpoint of this Court's jurisprudence, while it is in a sense a question of semantics, I think it is fair for us to characterize a decision affirming as an extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.871" offset="956105">Now, there is a second--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="201.246" offset="965509">Well, has there been a practice for 60 years of recognizing the exclusionary rule?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="219.831" offset="1039906">--I am not sure how to answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.707" offset="1047429">There is not a single decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals or a single decision of a federal court since 1920 in which it has been held that evidence should be suppressed in a deportation proceeding, so there has never been a case before the... there is only one case, and that is the case of respondent Sandoval, in which it was held that someone should not be deported because of the application of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.070" offset="1164875">Now, it is true that there are cases in which the courts, the BIA, at least, had considered the question whether an arrest was lawful, whether certain evidence was lawfully obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.750" offset="1219524">In every one of those cases, and there are not very many over this 60-year period, it was either determined that there was no illegality or that there was enough other evidence of deportability, so it never was necessary for the BIA actually to hold yea or nay as to whether the exclusionary rule was applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.509" offset="1306564">And when Matter of Sandoval, which is the 1979 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals, came before the board, the board concluded four to one that this was effectively a question of first impression for them, and that they were free to make a decision on the merits and not bound by precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.671" offset="1383259">There was one dissenting member of the board who felt it had been the practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.467" offset="1402485">Now, I am not sure what to make of it from the standpoint of this Court, except I think it is quite important to understand that if this Court decides today that the exclusionary rule should apply to deportation proceedings, that will work a dramatic change in the nature of the deportation process from what it was before.</text>

            <text syncTime="382.091" offset="1688892">My position, I think, would be that it is not constitutionally required, but it is a very different thing to say that the Board of Immigration Appeals in its discretion should determine what kind of evidence it will receive in its proceedings for the courts to tell the Board of Immigration Appeals what kind of evidence it should receive.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="423.060" offset="1852836">Well, in the context of the courts, we do have a judicially adopted exclusionary rule which does require the exclusion of illegally seized evidence, and we have not suggested in the cases that the Court has previously heard that it should modify the rule so far as to allow the admission of such evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.844" offset="1959938">So, in the context of criminal prosecutions, at least, it is not our position that this evidence should be deemed admissible, but I think it is quite a different question as to when the courts are reviewing the decisions of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.007" offset="2036634">I think it would be tenable perhaps to say that even that kind of evidence is admissible, but of course cases like Verochin against California suggested even before Mapp that there was a restriction on the use of such evidence in criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.687" offset="2099328">I don't know if I have fully answered your question, but I think that in terms of this Court's own jurisprudence, the only holding that really has any applicability is its decision in Janis, United States against Janis, and while that case clearly imposes substantial restrictions on the use of the exclusionary rule in civil proceedings, we concede that its reasoning does not foreclose the possible extension of the exclusionary rule to certain types of civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.236" offset="2257525">Now, for those who already entertain substantial doubts about the wisdom of the exclusionary rule and its existing applications, they may prefer to simply draw the line, and to resist its extension to entirely new contexts such as non-punitive civil proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.539" offset="2322727">But the Court does not have to go so far or adopt such a broad rule to decide this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.412" offset="2358253">Rather, we think it can decide this case by employing the traditional cost-benefit analysis that it has used in deciding the application of the exclusionary rule in connection with various aspects of criminal proceedings, and it is to that analysis that I would like to turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.813" offset="2419798">But before I address the costs and benefits of applying the exclusionary rule in deportation proceedings, I think it is useful to take a little journey through the looking glass, as it were, to the imaginary world that respondents depict.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.369" offset="2474028">Their argument here rests critically on the following series of assertions.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.412" offset="2494195">First, that there has long been and continues to be a widespread pattern of Fourth Amendment violations by INS agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.238" offset="2525542">Second, that there has long existed prior to the BIA's decision in Matter of Sandoval in 1979 a meaningful and substantial exclusionary rule remedy in deportation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.637" offset="2575070">Third, that this state of affairs imposed no serious burden on the deportation process because suppression claims were infrequently raised and even more rarely successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.666" offset="2619269">Fourth, that the decision in Matter of Sandoval created a situation in which open season was declared on the Fourth Amendment rights of Hispanic Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.662" offset="2663259">And fifth, that only a restoration of the exclusionary rule in deportation proceedings can restore those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.922" offset="2696278">Now, if these various assertions were accurate, a case could be made for respondent's position, but they are fundamentally inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.448" offset="2734312">First, as the Court of Appeals itself noted, there is no evidence of serious or widespread Fourth Amendment violations by INS agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.868" offset="2776004">Now, of course, there are bound to be some.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.133" offset="2785094">They make over a million arrests a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.289" offset="2793767">It would be inconceivable if they didn't make mistakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.271" offset="2809649">It would be inconceivable if occasionally they didn't detain people without reasonable suspicion or arrest them without probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.063" offset="2840787">But what is so striking about this case is the inability of anybody to point to any substantial evidence of a serious pattern of violations by immigration agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.416" offset="2898257">Secondly, and this is the point I made in responding to Justice Brennan's question before, it is clear that the exclusionary rule has never been a meaningful aspect of deportation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.974" offset="2944441">As I said, there is not a single case since 1920 in which a court or the Board of Immigration Appeals has suppressed evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="717.266" offset="3029600">I think the dilemma is not ours in this respect, because the problem that we are concerned about is not so much that the occasional illegal alien will escape deportation as a result of the application of the exclusionary rule, but the systemic consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.070" offset="3100862">Now, what happened, I think, quite clearly prior to 1979 is that there was no general understanding that the exclusionary rule applied, that people would occasionally raise claims that dealt with the legality--</text>

            <text syncTime="1148.598" offset="4754936">The circumstances of their arrest are uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.520" offset="4766639">The evidence against them is arguably a fruit of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.316" offset="4777819">But they don't appear in the jurisprudence, so I just think it cannot be said that the exclusionary rule was a meaningful feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.310" offset="4817839">But if you decide this case against us, I have no doubt that there will be a tremendous impact on deportation proceedings in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.090" offset="4848977">Now, that impact may be worthwhile, and I would like to turn to the question of whether the benefits from applying the exclusionary rule in terms of deterring illegal searches and seizures by immigration officers are worth the costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.390" offset="4930165">First of all, I'd like to make a general point about the perspective from which this issue should be approached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.217" offset="4969453">There has only been one time before that this Court has extended the exclusionary rule to a significant new class of cases and that was Mapp against Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.136" offset="5005084">There it was confronted not only with the case in which there had been a particularly egregious Fourth Amendment violation, but with a situation in which the exclusionary rule seemed to be the only way to curb a nationwide epidemic of police violations of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.566" offset="5066838">And the Court of Appeals itself recognized that there is nothing comparable to that that anybody is aware of in the immigration context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.077" offset="5104872">Nevertheless, it wholly ignored that factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.325" offset="5117829">It simply began its analysis by pointing out that since INS agents' duties are to apprehend illegal aliens for purposes of deportation, the application of the exclusionary rule would be in an area within their zone of primary interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1452.248" offset="5969525">Now, I would like to look first briefly... let me just say that the point that I was making before about the Court of Appeals' analysis is that to say that this... these arrests are within the zone of primary interest because what they are looking toward is the deportation of the aliens is to raise an issue for this Court, because if you didn't at least get that far, there would be no issue under Janis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.310" offset="6097839">It would be quite clear that the exclusionary rule wouldn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.246" offset="6109542">But I agree that there is an issue for this Court to consider which requires balancing the potential benefits in terms of deterrence of misconduct from applying the exclusionary rule against the special costs that may exist in the deportation context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.272" offset="6173698">Now, in terms of the benefits, it is not, we believe, accurate to equate the effect of the application of the exclusionary rule on immigration officers with the effect of the application of the exclusionary rule in criminal prosecutions on police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.170" offset="6257290">There are at least three significant differences between this case and Mapp that make it far less likely that application of the exclusionary rule will provide important incremental incentives to lawful conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.994" offset="6304520">First is the difference between the countless local police forces scattered around the country in Mapp, and here a single federal agency, which has shown itself to be sensitive to Fourth Amendment issues, which does follow judicial decisions, issue guidelines to its agents instructing them what they may or may not do, provide them with a substantial amount of training, have disciplinary procedures, and there is a lot of dispute about how effective--</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="1584.253" offset="6497617">--The question for this Court, Justice Rehnquist, is whether adding the exclusionary rule in deportation proceedings to the existing means that are available to obtain compliance with the Fourth Amendment will provide a substantial increment of deterrence of illegal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.889" offset="6564177">I want to make the point, and I will have to sit down in a moment, that there is a substantial difference in the activities and the incentives that operate on INS agents and police officers who are looking to solve crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.553" offset="6626766">INS... where a police officer might make eight or ten or fifteen arrests in a year leading to criminal prosecutions, INS agents make hundreds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.174" offset="6661248">In many, many of the cases, it does not go to a deportation hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1631.251" offset="6685594">So that the degree of probability that the exclusionary rule will actually be applied if the agent violates the Fourth Amendment is far less, far less in the immigration context than it is in the criminal context, and therefore the assumption of deterrence that the court is willing to make in the context of criminal prosecutions carries far less weight in the context of immigration operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.700" offset="6875347">Another important question is the reliability of the determination that the Fourth Amendment has been violated in deciding to apply the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.854" offset="6915994">The exclusionary rule can't accomplish its purpose if it is supplied to suppress evidence that was in fact lawfully seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.021" offset="6952670">So you only... it is going to work only where it is reasonably accurate in identifying the class of cases in which there has been an illegal obtaining of evidence, and only the suppression of that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.016" offset="7012647">Now, as the Sandoval case itself shows, the remedy cannot be applied with precision in the deportation context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.526" offset="7046711">What the Court of Appeals essentially said is, the officer couldn't remember the precise details of his encounter with Mr. Sandoval, so he hasn't carried his burden of proof, and so we are going to determine that the arrest was illegal, and so we are going to suppress the statement, all against a background in which it seems to me quite clear that in all probability there was no Fourth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.706" offset="7143364">So, I think it is very important, and we made the same point in connection with the so-called good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, that when you are... as to these cases where it is difficult to determine whether there has been a Fourth Amendment violation, applying the exclusionary rule won't work the way you want it to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1861.143" offset="7605104">They are the people who know what the immigration, the deportation process is like far better than the courts, and they said that absent the applicability of the exclusionary rule, questions relating to deportability routinely involve simple factual allegations and matters of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.120" offset="7669052">When Fourth Amendment issues are raised in deportation hearings, the result is a diversion of attention from the main issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.866" offset="7696010">The result is asking people who don't at least currently have the expertise to decide these questions, and particularly pertinent here, the BIA said the result frequently seems to be a long, confused record in which the issues are not clearly defined, and in which there is voluminous testimony, but the underlying facts are not sufficiently developed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.665" offset="8315217">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, at the heart of this case is the question of whether the Fourth Amendment will remain enforceable in the immigration context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.482" offset="8382508">In the criminal law enforcement setting, the Court seven years ago in Weeks and later in Mapp versus Ohio adopted the exclusionary rule as the only way to give life and meaning to the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.934" offset="8432350">Although deportation proceedings have been given a civil label, they are completely analogous in this regard to criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.443" offset="8466309">The rule in deportation proceedings functions in the same way, serves the same values, and provides the same effective safeguard against arbitrary intrusions by government officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.597" offset="8515001">I plan to address here four principal reasons why the government's arguments for a different treatment are invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.578" offset="8542900">First, the Fourth Amendment privacy rights to be protected are just as important in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.355" offset="8569963">The Fourth Amendment protects society generally, not just the rights of those accused of criminal violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.335" offset="8597862">Second, the degree of deterrence is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.822" offset="8611863">As in the criminal context, it is direct and substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.678" offset="8627328">Third, there are no other remedies which will effectively enforce Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.598" offset="8658988">The alternatives urged by the INS in this context are no different than those which have been rejected as inadequate and insufficient in the criminal setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.325" offset="8701829">And fourth, the social costs of applying the rule to deportation proceedings are no greater than the social costs in the criminal setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.745" offset="8735579">Moreover, the immigration system itself has demonstrated in the past that it can function under the rule without excessive costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2186.105" offset="8904957">And in addition, the Board of Immigration Appeals set up a procedure for examining motions for suppression, placed the burden on the alien to show that the conduct was illegal, and then once that prima facie showing of illegality was established, the burden then would shift to the government to show the lawfulness of the conduct in a particular situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2220.276" offset="9041630">However, prior to that time, it had also looked at offers of proof in this setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.288" offset="9077679">It set up the specific mechanism for review in the Matter of Tsang case, Matter of Wong, and Matter of Tong case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.049" offset="9124804">Now, with regard to Mr. Frey's argument that there is a paucity of decisions in this area, let me just address the population that we are dealing with with regard to the suppression motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.823" offset="9211844">First of all, the target population is in general a group that is poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.865" offset="9232010">It is legally unsophisticated, and they are not in general represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.599" offset="9254998">Secondly, the nature of the bureaucracy itself tends to understate the amount of the problem here, because first of all immigration law judge decisions are not reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.187" offset="9313303">A substantial number of Board of Immigration Appeals decisions are not reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.525" offset="9334724">As we just heard, it is something like 10 percent per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.153" offset="9349143">And finally, there are built-in incentives in the system so that people tend to opt for voluntary departure rather than to insist on their right to a deportation hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2338.729" offset="9515491">Since you analogize this... you seem to think a deportation proceeding equates to a criminal proceeding, is that voluntary deportation somewhat analogous to a guilty plea in a criminal case?</text>

            <text syncTime="2359.844" offset="9599919">However, getting back to the issue of whether or not the reported decisions themselves indicate the amount of significance that an exclusionary rule could have in terms of applying it in this context, it is clear that the number of decisions themselves would not fully indicate the amount of impact the decision could have on the general training and supervision of officers in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.142" offset="9733143">A good example in the criminal setting is the reaction to this Court's decision in Delaware versus Prouse, when the random traffic stop practice was invalidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.323" offset="9785911">For example, in the District of Columbia the chief of police issued a telex to officers informing them of this new practice with regard to traffic stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.522" offset="9838678">The same sort of mechanism applies in the immigration context, so that when the Court of Appeals is reviewing the Board of Immigration Appeals' decisions with regard to the Fourth Amendment, the judicial review establishes the standards under which these officers will conduct their future investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.590" offset="9934913">In Matter of Sandoval, the Board of Immigration Appeals really turned its back on its prior history, and decided in large part because of the civil nature of the proceeding that it would no longer apply the rule in deportation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.429" offset="10002309">That decision was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.632" offset="10011086">It was based in part on a misapplication of the Janis decision, and should not be followed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.426" offset="10034283">The Fourth Amendment privacy rights are just as important whether the government is enforcing civil immigration laws or criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.327" offset="10073884">The Fourth Amendment itself was adopted in response to abuses which arose in the enforcement of civil rather than criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.824" offset="10107844">The use of general warrants in enforcement of libel laws and writs of assistance in enforcement of British taxation and import regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.305" offset="10141803">The privacy interest itself is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.398" offset="10154133">Here, the privacy interest to be protected and those interests most threatened by INS intrusions are the targets of INS searches who look like or could be mistaken for illegal aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.123" offset="10221111">At the current time, that group is composed largely of persons of Hispanic or Asian ancestry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.982" offset="10248487">The interests to be protected are thus more important in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.166" offset="10273251">For example, in area control operations, INS inevitably encounters numerous citizens of Hispanic ancestry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.286" offset="10305747">In California, for example, there are 4.5 million persons of Hispanic dissent, and 70 percent of that number are citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.254" offset="10341587">In Texas, 88 percent of the state's Hispanic population of nearly three million are citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.361" offset="10366038">Where those most threatened by INS intrusions are members of a racially defined minority group, they deserve the most resolute protection of Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.105" offset="10417029">Next, with regard to the deterrent effect in this context, as in the criminal setting, excluding illegally obtained evidence in deportation proceedings would exert a substantial deterrent effect on unconstitutional conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.440" offset="10490381">The government concedes that deportation of illegal aliens, not criminal prosecution, is the primary concern of immigration officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.015" offset="10532595">Obtaining evidence of deportation is therefore in the officer's zone of primary interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.887" offset="10560075">In addition, there is no question here that the offending INS officers work for the same federal agency which seeks to use the unlawfully obtained evidence in their case in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.443" offset="10610335">They share a common law enforcement goal and purpose, and the agency utilizes a large investigative force in which to perform this function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.360" offset="10657982">By the very nature of this process, therefore, INS agents are pushed by the pressures of their jobs to the very limits of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.937" offset="10696330">There are pressures on the agents to apprehend large numbers of deportable aliens rather than to concentrate on whether or not their apprehensions comply with constitutional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.054" offset="10756830">There is therefore in this case a demonstrable need for a deterrent sanction in immigration investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.129" offset="10793088">Here, in addition, although the government maintains that in this case there is not a serious penalty with regard to civil deportation proceedings, this Court has recognized in the past that deportation can be a severe punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.448" offset="10870410">It can be the equivalent of banishment or exile, and in the words of the Court, it can mean the loss of all that makes life worth living.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.195" offset="10905310">In many cases, the civil consequence of a deportation proceeding can be of greater importance to the individual and also the law enforcement goals of the system than imposition of a corresponding criminal sanction for exactly the same conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.450" offset="10990364">Therefore, under the rationale of One 1958 Plymouth Sedan versus Pennsylvania, the serious consequences of deportation proceedings provide another justification for applying the rule in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.414" offset="11050237">All of these factors taken together sharply distinguish this case from Janis, Calandra, and the other cases in which the Court has declined to apply the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.925" offset="11100288">Here the deterrent effect is not marginal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2769.741" offset="11239573">Well, as in the criminal setting, the Bivens actions or civil damage actions do not provide an effective substitute for the rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2799.070" offset="11356810">Well, the problem with regard to the reliance on civil damage actions as a surrogate for the rule in this context is that first of all the nature of the population, which I already mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.127" offset="11421071">The citizens who may be apprehended because they work alongside illegal aliens are probably a population which is very unlikely to have the resources and the access to legal representation in order to pursue civil damage actions, and as the government has conceded in its brief, Bivens actions are very rarely successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.008" offset="11516575">There is the good faith immunity defense on the part of INS officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.756" offset="11539563">And with regard to the deterrent impact of a civil damage action, the real question is with regard to those instances which would not be tremendously flagrant or egregious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.375" offset="11606123">The civil damage actions do not provide the incentive for INS officers to err on the side of constitutional behavior, and therefore cannot provide an effective alternative to the exclusionary rule in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.086" offset="11668921">The same is true with regard to the other alternatives which the government relies on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.973" offset="11708418">For example, declaratory and injunctive actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.737" offset="11719494">Now, as outlined last term in City of Los Angeles versus Lyons, because of equitable and standing prerequisites, it is very difficult to obtain injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.168" offset="11769231">Injunctive relief can be obtained only where the victims of the unlawful actions can establish that INS would subject them to another unlawful search or seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.069" offset="11816879">Moreover, it must be shown under Rizzo versus Goode that the actions are a result of a policy adopted by INS.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.443" offset="11850315">Therefore, the injunction can be obtained only in rare cases, and only after the deterrent mechanism has already failed with regard to the institution of an unconstitutional policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.672" offset="11903292">Reliance on internal rules, training, and discipline have not been effective as an accepted alternative in the... acceptable alternative in the criminal setting, and in the case of INS, has been used in the past only to sanction the most flagrant and appalling misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.912" offset="12000258">There are three major failures of the INS disciplinary procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.068" offset="12020843">First of all, it is not applied to Fourth Amendment violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.315" offset="12037875">Secondly, there has been no recordkeeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.580" offset="12046861">And thirdly, the procedures are themselves inadequate on their face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.405" offset="12070162">With regard to the first point, that INS does not in fact discipline officers for Fourth Amendment violations, INS can point to no disciplinary sanctions applied to INS officers for Fourth Amendment violations since the Matter of Sandoval decision in 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.476" offset="12150515">In fact, the only examples of discipline that INS has produced for the last four fiscal years are truly criminal and flagrant misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.517" offset="12210596">Three officers were terminated or suspended because of rape of aliens, three for physical brutality of federal undercover agents posing as aliens, and in one case a supervisory agent abused and detained a United States citizen for 19 hours without food or water, and transported him to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.176" offset="12301293">Therefore, it is obvious from the way that the internal procedures have been applied that INS is not applying high priority in terms of disciplining officers for Fourth Amendment violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.436" offset="12370361">Secondly, INS keeps no adequate records of Fourth Amendment violations, and does not and therefore cannot monitor the effectiveness of its training procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.512" offset="12410590">And third, as we mentioned in our brief, there are significant inadequacies with regard to the procedures themselves on their face.</text>

            <text syncTime="3074.133" offset="12457088">Ms. Heen, in your brief, at Footnote 9 on Page 30, you refer to the fact that patterns of INS conduct described and reported in cases evidence widespread Fourth Amendment violations by immigration officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.720" offset="12527409">Then you cite INS versus Delgado, which of course was reversed by us yesterday; Immigration Council versus Piliot, which I don't believe can be the law any more after Delgado.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.964" offset="12576415">Are these the theme of all your citations?</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.632" offset="12587073">Are they pretty well overruled by our decision yesterday?</text>

            <label>Ms. Mary L. Heen</label>
            <text syncTime="3109.349" offset="12597940">--No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.582" offset="12610897">With regard to LaDue versus Nelson, Mendoza versus INS, and Marquez versus Kiley, these cases, although only the Mendoza versus INS case arouse subsequent to the Matter of Sandoval decision, are really used as examples of the kind of conduct which INS officers have overstepped the boundaries with regard to compliance with the Fourth Amendment in their investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.945" offset="12756346">The government places great reliance with regard to the issue of whether or not there are widespread violations in this context, and I think that we would be closing our eyes to the problem which exists with regard to an area of law enforcement where there are over a million apprehensions per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.353" offset="12877973">Mapp versus Ohio, in which the Court applied the exclusionary rule to this case through the due process clause, does not require a showing of widespread violations prior to applying the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.239" offset="12945577">There, the Court held that there is really no Fourth Amendment in the criminal context without application of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.610" offset="12982985">The government also relies on the fact that this is one single federal agency, and therefore is more manageable with regard to protection of Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.070" offset="13044843">If that were the rationale, the FBI, also one single federal agency, with regard to the application of the exclusionary rule, which has always applied in the context of federal criminal enforcement since Weeks, would also apply in terms of the rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.355" offset="13165946">In addition to the reported cases, with regard to the indication of the problem in this area, and also the nature of the population and the nature of the bureaucracy with regard to this, I may just point out that in terms of the record in this particular case, both of the issues arose during a time period when the exclusionary rule applied in deportation proceedings, and therefore there was no attempt to make this kind of record below with regard to the extent of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.871" offset="13348072">Finally, I would like to address with regard to alternatives the government's reliance on the due process exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.301" offset="13389764">The government maintains that this is a discretionary rule, and was not adopted as a constitutional requirement, but in terms of the actual language of the Board of Immigration Appeals' decision in Matter of Toro, and prior to that in its unpublished decision in In re Ramira-Cordova, it is clear that the Board of Immigration Appeals felt that it was compelled under the due process clause to apply the exclusionary rule for egregious Fourth Amendment violations, and therefore it is analogous in some respects to the rule which was adopted by the Court in Rochen versus California and later discussed in the Irvine versus California case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.672" offset="13579308">The problem with regard to relying on this rule as an effective alternative is that basically it rewrites the Fourth Amendment in the immigration context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.559" offset="13642838">In other words, unreasonable but less severe violations would be permitted in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.852" offset="13671991">It also fails to provide clear standards for application of the exclusionary rule, and this is a problem which was addressed in the Irvine decision in the criminal context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.518" offset="13718593">And finally, because it applies to intentional misconduct, it may require inquiry into the subjective state of mind of the officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.045" offset="13756732">Thus the due process exclusionary rule does not provide adequate protection of Fourth Amendment values.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.747" offset="13787556">I would like to next address the issue of the societal costs involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.304" offset="13817754">The social costs of applying the rule in this context provide no basis for a distinction between deportation proceedings and criminal proceedings, yet the government argues that the cost to society of applying the rule in this context is greater than we can afford, even greater than the cost borne by the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.376" offset="13902077">That argument should be rejected for the following three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.060" offset="13920781">First, the immigration system has functioned under the rule in the past without excessive cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.603" offset="13947008">And it presently functions under a due process exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.541" offset="13966756">For example, suppression motions are permitted for violation of INS regulations, and suppression motions are also ruled upon with regard to the voluntariness of statements and the voluntariness under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.986" offset="14044497">Applying the rule in deportation proceedings therefore will not mark a change in procedure, and will not require the system to adapt to something which has not already functioned quite adequately in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.790" offset="14119729">The government's attempt to label the rule's application as a judicial licensing of unlawful conduct is simply a red herring in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.051" offset="14160794">No special class of aliens will result as a consequence of applying the rule in this context at any time independent, untainted evidence of alienage may support a deportation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.262" offset="14221607">In fact, as the reported cases show, that is extremely common in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.133" offset="14241146">In addition, the government fails to note that once the due process exclusionary rule is applied in this context, and a deportation proceeding is terminated as a result of that suppression motion, an alien also is released, and that same person can later be apprehended on the basis of independent tips and all the other enforcement mechanisms that the agency uses to apprehend illegal aliens.</text>

            <text syncTime="3560.571" offset="14402897">The factory raid situation, where the INS goes into a factory and surveys it to determine whether or not there are illegal aliens working there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.269" offset="14453679">An example of a pre-Matter of Sandoval decision in which the Board of Immigration Appeals applied independent evidence in order to deport someone is the case of In the Matter of Perez-Lopez.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.964" offset="14512402">And in that case, which was decided in 1972, the immigration law judge had suppressed evidence of deportability at the original hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.069" offset="14560885">That hearing was terminated, and later on the hearing was reopened when the agency received from an informant information that the person was in this country illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.531" offset="14614697">Therefore, on the basis of that independent source of information, the Board of Immigration Appeals upheld the deportation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.060" offset="14652836">That provides an example of how the system has been able to work under the rule in the past, and that same sort of evidence can be used in the future in order to deport those who may be released as a result of application of the exclusionary rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3647.191" offset="14749385">One of their arguments is not just how it works in a particular case, but rather that if we decide the way you urge us to, that there will be an opinion on the books that will stimulate a large number of motions that have not been filed in the past, and both in the 70,000 contested cases and in the 900,000 uncontested cases there will be a very great practical change in the way these matters are handled.</text>

            <label>Ms. Mary L. Heen</label>
            <text syncTime="3674.787" offset="14859726">Well, there may be some slight increase in the number of suppression motions, which may be tied to the increased enforcement activity of the INS at the present time, but in terms of looking at the past history of applying the rule in this context, as mentioned earlier, the leading treatise in the field, going back to its original editions, had stated that it was undisputed that evidence obtained illegally may be suppressed in deportation hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.305" offset="14997757">Therefore, it was a part of the recognized administrative practice that such suppression motions could be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.723" offset="15027432">In addition, there are other types of suppression motions, not just Fourth Amendment suppression motions, which are filed in the context of a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.127" offset="15069124">In terms of the actual mechanism established by the Board of Immigration Appeals to review suppression motions, as pointed out by board member Appleman in the dissent in Matter of Sandoval, the answer is really to require a prima facie showing of illegality in order to support the suppression motion itself, and under the mechanism which was established in the pre-Matter of Sandoval decisions, that showing of illegality had to be supported by affidavits and by a non-frivolous offer of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.721" offset="15231501">Therefore, with regard to whether or not the agency will be swamped by the filing of frivolous suppression motions can really be addressed in terms of the mechanisms for review of these motions, and the agency may also, in addition to its mechanism for subpoenas, require the alien to file such a suppression motion prior to the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.706" offset="15355426">Therefore, the government will be able to respond in such a case to a non-frivolous assertion of illegality on the part of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.830" offset="15395863">What the government is really asking for in this case is that the Fourth Amendment not be enforced as rigorously in this context because it would be more efficient for the government to enforce immigration laws without the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.868" offset="15468066">So the costs relied upon by the government in this context are really the costs imposed on the enforcement system by the Fourth Amendment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.286" offset="15513728">There is a need for neutral procedures to be adopted by the agency, or a need for sufficient facts for the government to justify its intrusion, and that cost analysis has already been conducted by the framers of the Constitution in applying the Fourth Amendment to government intrusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.383" offset="15614142">It is really unacceptable for the government to say that it cannot enforce the immigration laws and live effectively within the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.830" offset="15663880">That is a bad enough result when it affects the rights of undocumented aliens, and it is an even worse result when its primary impact is on corroding the rights of Hispanic Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.296" offset="15709751">This Court must also consider the cost to society posed by an abandonment of the exclusionary rule in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.196" offset="15749352">With regard to whether or not this case requires an extension of the exclusionary rule or a return to former long-standing practice, what is important with regard to that consideration is whether or not, first of all, the costs asserted by the government are as significant as they maintain, and if you look at the past history of applying the rule, and the way that the suppression motions have come up in this context, that cost is not going to be significant in terms of the system being able to adopt procedures to apply the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.085" offset="15932941">But the issue of extension is also important with regard to the signal that it would send to agents out in the field who are enforcing the immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.158" offset="15981215">If the signal is that the Fourth Amendment is not going to be taken as seriously in this context as it is in the criminal context, and abandonment of the rule will indicate to officers in the field that their actions will not be reviewed with as much rigorousness, and they will have additional discretion in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.148" offset="16089153">The real danger is that officers will confuse ethnicity with probable cause in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.552" offset="16126769">This Court has structured a careful balancing of Fourth Amendment protections and law enforcement needs in the roving border patrol cases and the fixed checkpoint cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.436" offset="16170342">If freed from the exclusionary rule in this context, that balance would be lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.933" offset="16196255">Inevitably, given the pressures under which INS officers work, INS officers would increasingly confuse ethnicity with a reason for apprehending illegal aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.366" offset="16250067">Those who look like the targets of INS searches would be swept into an ever-growing net of suspicion and fear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.627" offset="16279115">In effect, the government asks that Hispanic Americans surrender the enjoyment of their Fourth Amendment rights to permit more efficient enforcement of immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.701" offset="16323419">That is a price that no American may be asked to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.765" offset="16339615">In sum, the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule should be applied in deportation proceedings just as it is applied in criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.573" offset="16378903">The privacy interests to be protected are just as important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.726" offset="16395517">The rule's deterrent effect is substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.818" offset="16407847">It has long been applied in deportation proceedings without excessive cost, and no realistic or equally effective alternatives exist which will adequately safeguard against violation of Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.283" offset="16461659">The Court should therefore affirm the judgment below.</text>

            <text syncTime="4084.341" offset="16497917">Mr. Frey, before you commence, it may or may not be important, but I am not clear as to what the answer is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.446" offset="16526338">Justice Brennan asked you at the outset of your argument a question whether or not the statement in the brief of respondents was correct that the rule had been enforced consistently for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.285" offset="16581718">I understood you to say that there was no evidence of that in the decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.454" offset="16614423">Counsel for respondents say, and they cite Pages 67-69 of their brief, that there have been any number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.214" offset="16657473">I haven't looked at those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.480" offset="16666459">Maybe I misunderstood either or both of you.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.696" offset="16679311">What is the situation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="4131.869" stopTime="4190.155">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="4131.869" offset="16688088">--Well, I think the situation is that it is difficult to know in the purely abstract sense whether the exclusionary rule in the air applied in deportation proceedings prior to 1979 or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.035" offset="16744722">I don't think that was a matter that was ever quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.862" offset="16756007">There were a number of cases that reached the BIA with claims of Fourth Amendment violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.014" offset="16776591">Some of them, they said there was no Fourth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.792" offset="16795713">This is not a large number of cases compared to the total case load that we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.430" offset="16818283">Some of them they... a lot of the cases they cite are alien crewmen cases, where there was other evidence of alienage, and therefore the challenge to evidence was no necessary to reach a decision in the case, and therefore the BIA had no occasion to pass upon whether it should have been admitted or excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.063" offset="16896859">I would not say to you that it was clear that the exclusionary rule did not apply.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4190.155" stopTime="4203.523">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="4190.155" offset="16921205">They really wouldn't have wasted their time deciding Fourth Amendment issues in a case if the evidence was admissible anyway, would they?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="4203.523" stopTime="4206.989">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="4203.523" offset="16974704">If it was inadmissible anyway?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4206.989" stopTime="4210.662">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="4206.989" offset="16988497">You say they actually ruled on Fourth Amendment claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.943" offset="16996333">Why would they waste their time doing that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="4210.662" stopTime="4238.665">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="4210.662" offset="17003230">I am not suggesting to the Court that there was a settled principle that the exclusionary rule did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.019" offset="17024650">What I am suggesting to the Court is that it was not a significant feature in any way of the deportation hearing process or the review process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.810" offset="17067804">And on those... that handful of cases that reached the BIA where there were substantive Fourth Amendment questions raised, they either disposed of them or said it was unnecessary to consider them simply without deciding.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4238.665" stopTime="4246.803">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="4238.665" offset="17115243">But isn't it correct that they cite some cases that say they set up a regular procedure for processing, who had the burden of proof and all that sort of thing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="4246.803" stopTime="4296.658">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="4246.803" offset="17147739">I am not aware of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.632" offset="17155053">I am sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.428" offset="17158293">I will say that there is one case, this Perez-Lopez case, that is cited where deportation initially did not occur because of a Fourth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4262.716" offset="17211478">This was at the ALJ level.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.359" offset="17217956">One case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.279" offset="17221718">Now, just ask yourself, all of these people are being arrested in these various kinds of encounters that are bound to raise Fourth Amendment issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.996" offset="17252542">I just... I mean, I feel that something that is so clear to me is perhaps not as clear to the Court, but how could it have been a meaningful feature, and yet all these people who would have had at least colorable Fourth Amendment claims to suppress vital evidence in the deportation proceeding never went to a Court of Appeals until the Wong Chung Che case in 1975 in the First Circuit.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4296.658" stopTime="4298.970">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="4296.658" offset="17347210">Could it be they didn't have lawyers?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="4298.970" stopTime="4501.667">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="4298.970" offset="17356405">Well, that is an interesting point that I wanted to get to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.453" offset="17370407">One of the arguments... they had lawyers in the deportation process, I think, most of them, but one of the arguments that is made for why the costs are not unacceptable is that most of these people are poor, they won't have lawyers, they will be deported anyway, so it is all right to have the exclusionary rule because we can rely on the fact that they won't have lawyers to invoke these rights that we are giving them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.989" offset="17448565">Now, this seems to be a very odd way to try to minimize the costs of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.677" offset="17475315">What it really shows... it is true, most of them don't have lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4333.221" offset="17493496">Most of them leave without asserting all the legal rights that they could assert, and it is for that very reason that the exclusionary sanction is not going to be an effective way of getting INS agents who are otherwise acting without regard to their responsibilities under the Fourth Amendment to change their behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="4351.430" offset="17566325">We are not talking here about rewriting the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.260" offset="17581581">My friend does not keep clearly in mind the distinction between the Fourth Amendment and the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.114" offset="17613032">The framers didn't adopt the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.879" offset="17624108">They adopted the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4367.036" offset="17628706">If applying the exclusionary rule substantially advances Fourth Amendment values, a case can be made for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.642" offset="17655142">If it doesn't, I think no case can be made for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.267" offset="17665591">Now, with respect to Justice Rehnquist's question about their footnote, of course there are some violations that probably occur that are not... do not involve the issues in the Delgado case that was decided yesterday, but I think the vast bulk of claims do involve that kind of claim, so that the history of violations against which the Court should decide whether it needs an exclusionary rule here is largely violations that have turned out upon this Court's inspection of the legal issue not to be violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4412.579" offset="17810936">This also alters the cost-benefit balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.436" offset="17826296">These people can still raise the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.358" offset="17834028">If Sandoval's claim were to be believed, he was walking through the line with the mask on, minding his own business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.870" offset="17860046">He was grabbed by the seat of the pants, put into the restroom, no questions asked, without any reason whatsoever, taken down to the station house, and presumably all 37 of these people, for all we know, the same thing happened to them, yet it happened just by a stroke of good fortune that all 37 of these people were illegal aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.255" offset="17937577">They were incredibly lucky in using these procedures that supposedly violated the Fourth Amendment to have such a good batting average.</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.703" offset="17967357">The point in these cases is that it is going to be very hard when you get into this kind of nitty-gritty, what did the agent see, what did the agent know, what did the alien do, was there a seizure, was it supported by reasonable suspicion, at what point was the admission of illegal alienage made, these are exceedingly intricate questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4472.884" offset="18052098">If these 70,000 deportation hearings, which now have very few... have had very few cases in which that kind of question is raised, if that kind of question has to be litigated in a substantial number of these cases, and then on appeal to the BIA, and then, don't kid yourselves, on appeals to the Courts of Appeals, because if you say there is an exclusionary rule, you will see this in the courts as well as within the immigration system.</text>
