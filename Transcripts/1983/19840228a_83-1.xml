            <label>Mr. Louis J. Caruso</label>
            <text syncTime="78.683" offset="456056">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves a collateral attack on state courts' proceedings by way of habeas corpus review in Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.260" offset="510286">It concerns a claimed erroneous jury instruction that was given on presumed intent, in connection with a murder trial of Respondent Engle, which culminated in a guilty verdict of first degree murder in July of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.221" offset="578205">The Federal District Court concluded that the claimed infirm instruction is not constitutionally infirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.808" offset="612477">The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed and reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.195" offset="634107">Collateral attack here is precluded by the failure of Respondent Engle to make timely objection to the claimed infirm instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.734" offset="676216">Michigan has a contemporaneous objection requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.121" offset="693771">It is embodied in statute and in court rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.257" offset="710280">The rule contains, however, an escape provision:</text>
            <text syncTime="145.941" offset="725013">"and the Court will review error, without objection. "</text>
            <text syncTime="149.576" offset="739537">to prevent what it calls a miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.630" offset="759808">Respondent, here, mistakenly asserts that there's a broad per se exception to that contemporaneous rule, objection rule, in that it does not apply to the instructions given on elements of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.859" offset="832742">None of the cases cited by Respondent support that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.763" offset="856357">What the Court does in those cases is actually apply the rule and make an assessment as to the likelihood of the potential for miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.052" offset="897526">And where the merits have been analyzed by the Court in those cases when the objection has not been made has been because it has been suspected that there is the potential for miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.176" offset="949980">It is not because the rule is not applied.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="205.330" offset="962623">Mr. Caruso, didn't the Sixth Circuit disagree with you on that point and say--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_j_caruso" startTime="209.782" stopTime="446.092">
            <label>Mr. Louis J. Caruso</label>
            <text syncTime="209.782" offset="980386">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.232" offset="982162">The Sixth Circuit said that the State of Michigan does not apply its contemporaneous objection rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.867" offset="1004732">But it does apply it.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.736" offset="1012255">And People v. Wright and People v. Perez, two cases of current vintage, although timely objections were not made in those two cases on presumed intent instructions, the Court took the opportunity in those cases to direct the trial court to stop making those sort of presumed instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.917" offset="1100967">But, nevertheless, in those cases, the Court reaffirmed the existence of the contemporaneous objection rule, and recognized its liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.225" offset="1154153">In the one case, in People v. Wright, it found harmless error; and, in the other case it found the error was harmless; but, nevertheless, as the Court indicated, quoting the rule, it is still the law in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.783" offset="1208383">Here, there is no objection made at the trial stage to the claimed infirm instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.037" offset="1237431">The direct appeal that was taken to the Michigan Court of Appeals as of Wright challenged only the intoxication instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.408" offset="1274943">The judgement of conviction became final in 1975 when that direct appeal ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.979" offset="1301170">There was no timely application made for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.966" offset="1325098">The first time the objection to the intent, presumed intent instruction, came out on three applications for delayed appeal, two to the State Supreme Court, and one application for delayed appeal to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.328" offset="1398554">Now, when those applications were filed, the prosecuting attorney raised the absence of compliance by the respondent was a contemporaneous objection rule, as well as making a response to the merits of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.806" offset="1472533">Now, the Court... all three of these applications for delayed appeal, were denied by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.729" offset="1504193">They were denied on the basis of lack of merits on grounds presented, and the Court is not persuaded that the question presented should be reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.101" offset="1549646">Now, although the Michigan Constitution does require that the Appellate Court, in denying leave to appeal in a matter, should give the grounds for the denial, a denial, the Court says, is not a decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.146" offset="1625820">And, thus, in order for Respondent Engle to have had his federal claim decided, it would have been necessary, in each one of those discretionary appeals, to have had the review on the merits by a grant of leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.090" offset="1701679">So we're taking the position here, insofar as Michigan law is concerned, and we seek the application of the Sykes Rule when there is a denial order... and Michigan has... has in Michigan... they have a contemporaneous objection rule; the defendant has not complied with it, and the prosecutor has argued the rule in response to the application for leave to appeal, and there is no decision on the merits because the Court has repeatedly said this to the bar in Michigan: then, a habeas court must assume that the state followed its contemporaneous objection rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.701" offset="1868131">This would be consistent with the general rule that, in habeas cases, the state court decision is presumed correct, absent a contrary showing, overwhelming contrary showing by the prisoner.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="446.092" offset="1925601">--Solicitor general, may I ask a question, because maybe I missed something you said.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.644" offset="1935841">But the Court of Appeals said that, in People against Wright, the Michigan Supreme Court held that the contemporaneous objection rule does not apply to Sandstrom instructions, as I read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.952" offset="1985055">I haven't read the Wright case myself.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis J. Caruso</label>
            <text syncTime="462.752" offset="1992265">In the Wright case, the Court applied the contemporaneous objection rule and made a decision that it should review this sort of an error, claimed error, simply because there's the likelihood of miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.727" offset="2052138">But the thing of it is, the Court also has supervisory authority over all litigation in state courts in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.147" offset="2081917">And they made it very clear; the reason that they took these cases was to seize upon the opportunity, in these two consolidated cases, to announce the prophylactic rule of Sandstrom, and directed the lower courts to stop using those kinds of instructions.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="518.102" offset="2213679">This position, I would say, promotes comedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.470" offset="2227158">And, as in the showing by the respondent/appellant... and there certainly has been no showing of cause and actual prejudice, actual prejudice at the level shown in U.S. v. Brady, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.413" offset="2290897">Here, the claimed instructional error does not contravene the decision of Sandstrom.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="543.982" offset="2317229">Mr. Caruso, normally we don't reexamine the holding of the Court of Appeals on what the state law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.938" offset="2353069">Do you plan to discuss the other arguments in this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="558.659" offset="2375952">But, insofar as the state law is concerned, I say that it has... the State of Michigan does have the contemporaneous objection requirement, and it is an independent state ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.817" offset="2432585">And this is what was held in Wainwright v. Sykes; it's what was held in several other cases.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="582.440" stopTime="604.488">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="582.440" offset="2471037">Well, if the State Supreme Court makes what we consider an erroneous instruction of its own law or statute that doesn't involve the Constitution, we certainly don't review it.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.180" offset="2510012">If the Court of Appeals makes what, in our view, is an error in construing a State Supreme Court opinion, that's open to review here, is it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_j_caruso" startTime="604.488" stopTime="718.374">
            <label>Mr. Louis J. Caruso</label>
            <text syncTime="604.488" offset="2559227">I would say so, yes, Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.440" offset="2571034">And I think that if that is the conclusion that they came to... and it is... that the State of Michigan does not apply contemporaneous objection rule, that that is erroneous, and that's contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.763" offset="2624324">But the Federal District Court agreed that the error that is claimed for by respondent/appellant did not violate the Sanstrom rule, and they didn't even bother to make a harmless error analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.642" offset="2691824">Engle was convicted of first degree murder in July of 1973, convicted of first degree murder of his foreman at the Chrysler Auto Plant in Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.931" offset="2732993">Believing him to have been responsible for having been laid off December 4, 1972, December 7, 1972, at 9:00 p.m., Engle entered the auto plant, told his nephew he was going to kill a guy.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.839" offset="2788686">Engle entered the Foreman Lantzy's office, encountered a clerk, and asked him as to where the... the whereabouts of Foreman Lantzy.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.546" offset="2831423">He said he was temporarily out, and offered to go find him.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.264" offset="2846365">Engle said that, never mind, that he would go find him.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.900" offset="2860889">At 9:45 p.m., two employees saw Engle talking to Lantzy and then saw him shoot Lantzy, who ran.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.989" offset="2893281">He was shot twice more, and he fell.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.674" offset="2899968">He stood over him, and then walked away and returned to the office of Lantzy and told the clerk that he had shot and killed Lantzy.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.711" offset="2932151">When the security guard arrived, he gave the gun to his security guard, and said that he had killed Lantzy.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.615" offset="2955766">The police arrived, and Engle described the shooting in detail, and said that he had ceased firing because he didn't want to hurt anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.119" offset="2989725">The next day, he gave the same version to the police officers in writing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis J. Caruso</label>
            <text syncTime="726.378" offset="3046776">--These facts are being urged in support of the fact that if this is error, it's harmless error, beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.198" offset="3074048">The respondent at trial testified that he did not remember the incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.769" offset="3100380">What he did do was interpose a defense of insanity, the irresistible impulse prong of the Michigan insanity defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.642" offset="3135802">Now, in Sandstrom, the Court instructed, the law presumes that a person intends the natural consequences of his voluntary acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.413" offset="3170910">That instruction was given, and the Court said a juror may have interpreted these words as a conclusive presumption, one overriding the presumption of innocence, and shifting the burden of proof to defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.455" offset="3219080">Now, here, in the Engle case, the subject instruction is not couched in mandatory terms; it is not a mandated presumption that would in any way shift the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.113" offset="3265682">What is does suggest is a reasoning process to the jury commenting on the relevant evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.200" offset="3298074">And you'll see, at page 13a of the Joint Appendix, the wording that was used by the judge in instructing the jury: We, of course, do not have the power to look into a person's mind to tell what the person is thinking of at any particular time, but the law gives a rule of thumb that a person is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.667" offset="3395981">Then it goes on to say: Therefore, in determining whether there was an intent to kill, you may properly consider that a gun was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.654" offset="3419909">You may properly consider the wounds, where the gun was held in relation to the body, and I think it is proper that you may consider all these things in determining whether or not there war an intent to kill.</text>

            <text syncTime="869.547" offset="3619485">We did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.982" offset="3621261">Therefore, the Court then went on to admonish the jury that they had to be satisfied with the proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.238" offset="3666192">In addition to that presumed intent instruction, the Court did tell the jury and instruct the jury on the six elements of homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.927" offset="3704957">And in instructing the jury on the six elements of homicide it told the jury that the prosecution had to prove each one of these elements beyond a reasonable doubt, and then had to also prove malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.619" offset="3767756">Now, instructions are only a component part of the entire trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.827" offset="3812582">It is given, usually, in the main, at the conclusion of the testimony and presentation of exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.814" offset="3840585">But for that reason, it's necessary to review the instruction in light of the entire record, to determine the impact that a particular instruction does have on the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.258" offset="3898264">And it's our contention that this presumed instruction that is claimed to be infirm did not have any adverse impact on the outcome here, although intent was technically in dispute during the course of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.101" offset="3957718">It was actually subsidiary to the claim of insanity, which was the focal point of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.921" offset="3980915">The proofs took up entirely, almost entirely, the time of the jury with proofs on insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.741" offset="4012262">They did not dispute the general intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.460" offset="4023129">As a matter of fact, during the course of the trial, in response to a question from the prosecuting attorney on cross examination of the defendant Engle, at the transcript at Volume III, page 314:</text>
            <text syncTime="985.220" offset="4082166">"You don't know... you're telling this jury that you don't know who killed Regis Lantzy? "</text>
            <text syncTime="988.086" offset="4093660">"Is that correct? "</text>
            <text syncTime="989.372" offset="4098780">"No, that's too much. "</text>
            <text syncTime="990.705" offset="4104109">"Too many witnesses said that I did it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="993.424" offset="4114975">"I'm not denying doing it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="995.190" offset="4122081">"I'm not even trying to justify doing it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="996.809" offset="4128559">"I'm just telling you I didn't know what I was doing it when I did it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.161" offset="4141934">"I don't remember doing it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.430" offset="4146949">"I'm not trying to justify me. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.146" offset="4153846">"There isn't any justification for the taking another man's life, unless it's in self defense. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.218" offset="4182162">Now, this is the tone that the evidence took in this entire trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.436" offset="4198985">Now, with respect to the insanity defense, the insanity instruction, that left no doubt that the jury was fully apprised as to its fact-finding function and the prosecution's burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.279" offset="4266381">In that particular instruction, the Court said the presumption of insanity is a legal presumption merely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.865" offset="4288742">It lasts only until some evidence is introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.317" offset="4302535">That merely states the Michigan law that insanity is an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.637" offset="4327821">You have to raise it, but you don't have to put any great body of proofs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.689" offset="4347988">It's simply, merely a burden of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.141" offset="4357810">And once that is put in, then the prosecutor has the burden of proving sanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.311" offset="4382574">And the Court actually did instruct the jury, in the words that the state has the burden of proving sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.984" offset="4417264">And that statement is contained in the insanity instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.369" offset="4430744">Accordingly, there was no doubt as to the jury's duty in the fact-finding function, and also in view of that language, it cannot be argued, it cannot be said that the jury was misled by these instructions in believing that the instruction given was... had the effect of shifting the burden of proof from the prosecutor to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.038" offset="4549444">And that simply did not happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="1502.995" offset="6153258">And what I'm saying is that that language in that presumed intent instruction did not have any bearing, any outcome, on the decision, on the finding of guilt by the jury, because there was enough contained in the rest of the instructions to indicate the prosecutor had to prove all of the elements of the crime; had to prove specific intent, had to prove malice, had to prove premeditation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1985.705" offset="8084125">The Court began by telling the jury that malice, a term which the Court used interchangeably with intent to kill, was to be implied from any deliberate or cruel act, however sudden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.243" offset="8130205">The Court then gave the instruction that, because we can't look into a person's mind and determine what they were thinking, the law provides a rule of thumb that a person is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.787" offset="8188406">The Court then reinforced the idea that intent was to be determined from the nature of Mr. Engle's acts, by explaining that legal presumption as like the old saying that "actions speak louder than words".</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.997" offset="8241277">The Court then specifically directed the jury's attention to three undisputed facts from the prosecutor's case, the natural consequence of which was death: the use of a deadly weapon, evidence of close-range firing, and the number and location of the wounds, any one of which would have been sufficient to trigger the presumption of intent the Court had just given them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2073.328" offset="8434584">This was a case in which the burden-shifting instructions permeated this charge to the jury from beginning to end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.183" offset="8466035">And I think the Court of Appeals did exactly what you said should do in Cupp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.053" offset="8485470">It read these as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.337" offset="8490590">It went on to look at the instructions with regard to the defenses presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.541" offset="8511488">With regard to insanity, the judge instructed the jury that the prosecution was entitled to a presumption that the defendant was sane and responsible for his acts, and then defined the quantum of evidence necessary to overcome that presumption as evidence raising a reasonable doubt of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.738" offset="8596229">With regard to the particular mental illness defense presented of dissociative reaction, the judge said where this can be proved, it would constitute a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.262" offset="8642309">What I'm saying to you is that these instruction, from top to bottom, shifted the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.016" offset="8669372">It wasn't a case of isolating one single line out of the instructions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2204.297" offset="8958495">All I am saying is that the State has pointed to this instruction, this particular instruction, the insanity instruction, and said this cured any burden-shifting effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.353" offset="8998724">In fact, the judge told the jury that only where the defendant's defense could be proven would it constitute a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.876" offset="9032788">That's the kind of instruction which clearly tells the jury the defendant has to prove his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.913" offset="9052954">And that's not Michigan law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.865" offset="9064762">Intent was... I started to say at the beginning, I was going to reply to your question, Justice Blackum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.785" offset="9092451">I'll get to that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.968" offset="9097153">This instruction, particularly the instruction that the law gives us a rule of thumb that a person is presume to intend the consequences of his acts, did affect the first degree premeditated murder finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.395" offset="9150861">The jury in this case, for example, could have found, from Mr. Engle's act of bringing a gun to the auto plant with him, driving to the plant with a gun, from that act, together with the presumption of law the Court had just given them, they could infer the necessary element of premeditation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.559" offset="9235498">These instructions were not carefully separated out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.444" offset="9251067">The judge didn't say, all right, here's first, here's second.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.964" offset="9265173">They were all combined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.630" offset="9271756">The issue of intent and malice were all balled up into a whole series of instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.934" offset="9297042">So these instructions very well could have led the jury to presume the existence of the necessary mens rea, unless Mr. Engle proved otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.276" offset="9342391">One of the State's main points in this case is that only irresistible impulse was challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.863" offset="9364752">That's not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.065" offset="9373529">The defense counsel, in closing, argued first that Mr. Engle had not planned or intended to kill the deceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.538" offset="9415429">He argued, second, that Mr. Engle was not mentally there at the time this happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.491" offset="9435282">He argued, third, that Mr. Engle did not know right from wrong at the time; and, lastly, he argued irresistible impulse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.413" offset="9470913">The trial prosecutor himself recognized that intent was a hotly-disputed issue in this case, because he specifically responded to each one of those claims in his closing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.571" offset="9519606">The trial judge also recognized that everything about intent was in dispute in this case; in fact, instructing the jury that Mr. Engle's claim was that he had not known what he was doing, and that the jury had to decide whether he was capable of forming a premeditated intent to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.801" offset="9600481">The State itself, in the very first appellate pleadings filed in this case, argue that intent was the crucial issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.442" offset="9643008">On page 14 of the prosecution's brief on appeal, in Michigan Court of Appeals case No. 18951, the prosecution characterized the defense presented in the following language, and I quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.321" offset="9714584">"The defense in this case was that the intent to kill was not there, as the defendant was temporarily insane or was so under the influence of intoxicating beverages as to not have the intent to kill. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.247" offset="9774247">That's the State talking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.313" offset="9782502">And the Michigan Court of Appeals, in its published decision, reviewing the same record you have before you today, characterized the defense presented as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.452" offset="9823044">"The defense was that defendant was so under the influence of librium, beer, and whiskey, that he could not have formed the specific intent to commit the crime of first degree murder. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.976" offset="9873199">Everyone who has looked at this case before you has come to the conclusion that state... that intent was the crucial issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.432" offset="9907054">And all of these series of instructions related to the issue of intent and raised a presumption of intent for the jury to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.556" offset="9963478">The evidence presented on this point was conflicting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.958" offset="9977062">Mr. Engle himself testified that he consumed an enormous amount of alcohol during the three days preceding the shooting, as well as ingesting four librium tablets on the last day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.282" offset="10022411">And he flatly denied ever intending to kill the deceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.903" offset="10036935">He testified, he conceded that he did the act of shooting, but he maintained that he had not known what he was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.340" offset="10066610">Dr. Mary Ainsley, a qualified psychiatrist, supported this testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.208" offset="10086149">She testified that, as a result of a whole series of personal tragedies culminating in the loss of his job--</text>

            <text syncTime="2512.725" offset="10192206">Dr. Ainsley testified that Mr. Engle suffered a dissociative reaction, mental breakdown, on the night of this shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.731" offset="10224180">She testified that such breakdowns are accompanied by impaired perception, judgment, and consciousness, and that, in her judgment, the combination of the intoxicants and the mental stresses this man had been under were sufficient to have blocked his consciousness to the point where he would not have been fully aware of what he was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.645" offset="10307877">I'd ask Your Honors to note that that appears on pages 359 through 361 of the transcripts, not 360 as I stated in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.934" offset="10349046">Regarding Mr. Engle's apparent ability to function during this period, to walk and talk, even the State's psychiatrist conceded, at page 420 of his testimony, that when a breakdown of this type occurs, somnambulistic behavior similar to sleepwalking and sleeptalking, is possible, in which an individual may say and do things, but not be fully consciously aware of what they are doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.852" offset="10452700">And, Chief Justice Burger, with regard to your question regarding the statements, Dr. Ainsley testified that Mr. Engle was able to recall what had happened during this period of time, as you or I might recall a nightmare upon waking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.761" offset="10508288">And that was the reason why, even though he was not conscious at the time, he was able to recall these things, like a dream.</text>

            <text syncTime="2650.816" offset="10744540">The same witness who testified that Mr. Engle said he was going to kill a guy when he came into this plant, testified that when Mr. Engle said this, he was not acting normally.</text>

            <text syncTime="2662.008" offset="10789261">He had a nervous pitch to his voice, and the things he was saying did not make much sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.477" offset="10815175">Two other witnesses who came in contact with Mr. Engle before the shooting independently testified to the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.898" offset="10844850">They both testified that they noted a very strange look in his eyes, a look which they described as something they'd never before seen in their lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.523" offset="10887377">With regard to the fact that Mr. Engle had a gun with him on this night, he himself testified that his best friend had been murdered in a nearby bar a few months before this, and that after that he bought a pistol and carried it with him wherever he went for self-protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.351" offset="10962714">In Detroit, I'd say that would be very believable testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="3039.781" offset="12300393">I wanted to make one final point with regard to the harmless error issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.519" offset="12335397">If intent was such an inconsequential and peripheral part of this case, and if these instructions were so minor and had no role in the case, why, then, did the trial court go to the lengths it did to inundate this jury with all of these presumptions, all relating to the question of intent?</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.902" offset="12428915">And, equally important, why did the trial prosecutor repeatedly urge the jury, throughout his closing argument, on no less than three occasions, to rely on Mr. Engle's acts in determining his intent, using language virtually identical to the natural consequences presumption that the Court would ultimately use in its instructions?</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.833" offset="12528598">I submit that the answer is that both the trial court and the trial prosecutor knew that the question of intent in this case was a hotly-disputed matter, an issue on which the jury could go either way, and they both wanted to make sure that, in resolving the factual dispute before them, these jurors applied these presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.716" offset="12620131">Even under a traditional Chapman v. California harmless error analysis, I don't think the State can carry its burden that these instructions did not contribute to the verdict obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.906" offset="12672899">I encourage you to read these instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.625" offset="12683766">You'll find that they stacked the deck against this defendant to such an extent that there was no way that the jury could fairly or constitutionally consider the evidence, the conflicting evidence of intent that the defense had presented.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis J. Caruso</label>
            <text syncTime="3158.258" offset="12774358">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.424" offset="12778956">I would like to advise the Court that, although I didn't comment on the retroactive argument, we have not abandoned that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.195" offset="12802048">We simply rely on what's been contained in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.315" offset="12818557">And, suffice it to say that we would agree with counsel that rules of law should be made retroactive if they are sufficiently related to the accuracy of the verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.456" offset="12867145">In this situation with Sandstrom, we characterize Sandstrom as more or less a prophylactic rule to protect against the possibility of a juror being misled by an instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.845" offset="12908628">It cannot be said that, in all cases heretofore, that Sandstrom affected the accuracy of a verdict, because in many of these cases, they were certainly not closed questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.720" offset="12952200">Now, with respect to the intoxication instructions, the intoxication instruction that was given was valid under Michigan law at the time it was given, and it was a capacity test instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.627" offset="12999743">In other words, the Court said, if you find that the defendant was so intoxicated that he was unable to form an intent, then you must find him not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.402" offset="13042897">But the fact of it is that it didn't concern a finding of intent as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.489" offset="13075289">The only thing is that they found, if he was incapacitated to that extent, then he couldn't be guilty of the crime; but, nevertheless, the jury found that he was not intoxicated to the extent that he lacked capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.316" offset="13126593">Now, with respect to the insanity testimony, there was testimony, not only from lay witnesses, there was testimony also from state psychiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.337" offset="13166613">There was a great deal of testimony; it was in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.006" offset="13177271">And the jury finally agreed to believe the testimony of the state witnesses, particularly I call your attention again to that instruction that was given on insanity, and that is, that the Court reminded, in so many terms, that the prosecution, the State, had the burden of proving sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.268" offset="13250309">And we presume now... it's quite evident, at least to me, that the jury did believe that the prosecution had proved sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.476" offset="13295135">And the question, the matter of the defense of insanity itself, does not relate to the elements of the crime that's separate and apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.664" offset="13327945">It doesn't relate to intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.598" offset="13335677">It is almost in the nature of an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.066" offset="13349575">You can still have intent to kill and he insane or be suffering from mental disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.289" offset="13382489">And that does not negate, in and of itself, the intent.</text>
