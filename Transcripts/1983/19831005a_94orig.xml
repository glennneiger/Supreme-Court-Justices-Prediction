            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="136184">We will hear arguments first this morning in South Carolina against Secretary Regan.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.293" offset="173278">Mr. Sinkler, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="huger_sinkler" startTime="14.179" stopTime="338.127">
            <label>Mr. Huger Sinkler</label>
            <text syncTime="14.179" offset="192817">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.617" offset="210581">South Carolina this morning responds to the leave granted by this Court to argue that this Court take original jurisdiction to dispose of the case which it seeks to bring against the Secretary of the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.891" offset="279648">Since its inception, South Carolina has been joined by perhaps some 27 states, and for that reason, we move before this Court... The Court granted permission to divide argument and I, thus, will yield ten minutes of my argument to the Assistant Attorney General from Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.145" offset="380690">She will stress the financial burdens that result to the states on account of this provision in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.391" offset="425725">The Solicitor General has suggested in his brief... I think it was in a footnote... that since this case so clearly lacks merit that the Court dismiss and grant him the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.618" offset="514646">I think that necessitates comment on the true issues that are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.614" offset="542545">This case really has a historic background.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.141" offset="572742">In 1894, Congress inacted an Income Tax Law which was broad and widesweeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.654" offset="610777">It included a provision taxing the interest on notes and bonds of whatever nature, except those bonds of the United States which, by the terms of their issuance, were exempt from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.974" offset="668037">That produced the famous litigation of Pollock against Farmers' Loan and Trust Company which was twice heard by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.959" offset="703982">At all times, it was unanimous that the very nature of the federal system prevented the imposition of the tax on the interest on state bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.949" offset="767929">However, because of its holding with respect to the lack of power to impose an excise tax on interest and dividends and rents, the law was declared... which had been declared unconstitutional by five to four in Pollock, really resulted in the adoption of the 16th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.722" offset="863015">Now, from the time of Pollock until 1982, with the enactment of TEFRA, Congress had conceded, although it was done originally by Mr. Cordell Hull as Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in 1913, the fact that interest on state bonds was immune from taxation, but in TEFRA we see a direct challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.535" offset="1014316">And, meanwhile the Court, while never having precisely this question before it, repeatedly said time after time that the doctrine of reciprocal immunity, which was essential to the federal system, resulted in the freedom from taxation of interest on state bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.448" offset="1105954">That lasted until 1982 when TEFRA challenges both the meaning of the 16th Amendment, as has been announced by this Court, although technically, I suppose, those pronouncements are dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.830" offset="1183485">They were pronounced so many times they seemed to work themselves into the body and tradition of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.685" offset="1206891">And, they have further challenged... Must further argue that the 16th Amendment permits this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.870" offset="1251613">We don't think it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.228" offset="1261017">The Solicitor General has urged that this Court should not take jurisdiction of this case despite the fact that the second clause of the second section of Article III of the Constitution specifically grants to this Court original jurisdiction in actions which involve a state and a citizen of another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.386" offset="1393719">What we are doing here, of course, is to seek an injunction against the Secretary of the Treasurer in the traditional fashion of enjoining an officer of the United States for performing... acting under an unconstitutional statute, and, thus, performing an illegal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.973" offset="1471982">I think Marbury against Madison got into this Court in the same way.</text>

            <label>Mr. Huger Sinkler</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="341.126" offset="1500612">You have left the merits and are going to the injunction act.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.108" offset="1512524">In your view would Congress have the power to pass a statute that said all bonds traded in the interstate market must be in registered form, including those issued by a state, without any taxation as a penalty?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="huger_sinkler" startTime="357.663" stopTime="389.444">
            <label>Mr. Huger Sinkler</label>
            <text syncTime="357.663" offset="1566754">I don't think they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.740" offset="1571142">I think that is an invasion of the state's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.754" offset="1583159">I think maybe in that case you might get yourself... Your determination might rest on a balancing of equities as has been traditional where the commerce clause is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.546" offset="1638329">Whereas here, where the taxation clause power is involved, what you really have here is a question of reciprocal immunity, one that really goes to the very nature of the federal system.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="389.444" stopTime="397.489">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="389.444" offset="1693918">But, that would be a lesser burden or a greater burden on the state than the one they have now because you can avoid the tax by selling--</text>

          <turn speaker="huger_sinkler" startTime="397.489" stopTime="398.877">
            <label>Mr. Huger Sinkler</label>
            <text syncTime="397.489" offset="1726101">I think we meet both burdens, sir.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="398.877" stopTime="399.645">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="398.877" offset="1731639">--You do?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="huger_sinkler" startTime="399.645" stopTime="489.982">
            <label>Mr. Huger Sinkler</label>
            <text syncTime="399.645" offset="1734669">I think we can meet both burdens and show you.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.626" offset="1742610">For instance, South Carolina sold $65 million of bonds on September 13 which we will deliver in New York next week.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.562" offset="1782421">We normally pay for paying agent services on an issue of $65 million... I think we have had some before and we figure it to be about $85,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.303" offset="1849294">The cost of paying registered... of issuing registered bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.475" offset="1866013">Now, they are not so terribly expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.035" offset="1872282">The cost of arranging for their transfers and arranging for checks to go out, we have an estimate from the Morgan Bank, which is our fiscal agent and bond registrar, that the cost of this issue, which has an average life to 11 years and extends to 00, will be $385,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.418" offset="1953784">South Carolina... which is an additional cost of, oh, I think it is $310,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.164" offset="1988788">It happens that South Carolina has approximately a debt of about $600 million and the state treasurer has structured that debt on a short-term basis so he will able to come back to the trough more frequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.082" offset="2052422">Well, if you just... assuming it was $650 million, you really have added costs in the neighborhood of over $3 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.700" offset="2086904">That is a good deal of money.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="489.982" stopTime="501.852">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="489.982" offset="2096099">Are you saying the federal government may not impose any regulation on the issuance of bonds that imposes any cost on the state?</text>
            <text syncTime="497.262" offset="2125147">You say they require to be printed in English and have certain disclosures and the like?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="huger_sinkler" startTime="501.852" stopTime="625.910">
            <label>Mr. Huger Sinkler</label>
            <text syncTime="501.852" offset="2143537">I think what you really do... I don't think the federal government, if we are going to have the traditional federal system, which is espoused really as far back as Weston against the City of Charleston, in which they said at that time that the doctrine of immunities springs from the very union of the states and the national government.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.440" offset="2217934">I realize you can also justify that under the Supremacy Act which, I think, several members of this Court have made that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.825" offset="2251475">I have no quarrel with that, but certainly as far as the reciprocal immunity which is granted to the states that results from the nature of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.195" offset="2296928">There is no provision in the Constitution of the United States to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.634" offset="2310617">As a matter of fact, the case, of course, went through the South Carolina constitutional court and by a four to three decision the majority said there is nothing in the Constitution of the United States which says we can't do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.032" offset="2376236">The dissenting judges said the very nature of the system makes it impossible for the state to tax the obligation of the federal government, because to do so... and I thought the interest rate comment was marvelous... even though Congress provide that the money be lent at ten percent, if the states can tax it, the Treasury of the United States will be powerless to borrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.756" offset="2479159">And, that is... See, the burden takes place, according to Chief Justice Marshall, the very existence of it creates a burden on the contract which has a sensible impact on the interest of the... influence on the contract itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.921" offset="2559825">And, furthermore, when one government can control the provisions, the actions of another government, then you obviously have that type of governmental interference which I personally believe the federal system precludes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="625.910" stopTime="642.343">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="625.910" offset="2639760">Of course, the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity kind of reached a high point in the 1870's or 1880's and then some of this Court's cases in the 30's rather drastically cut back on this, especially where states are concerned.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="huger_sinkler" startTime="642.343" stopTime="678.608">
            <label>Mr. Huger Sinkler</label>
            <text syncTime="642.343" offset="2705484">I think you did, but I think you have got good distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.637" offset="2710708">Take, for instance, the most famous of all the people who were really affected by this case, Chief Justice Hughes, who in Wilcutts against Bunn, reaffirms and points out that the difference between the imposing of tax on capital gains and on the interest on bonds is that one transaction... The transaction between the state and its lender has been finished and that is a totally new transaction which results in part from the acumen of the person who bought the bonds.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="678.608" offset="2850515">Did that case involve intergovernmental immunities?</text>

            <text syncTime="681.997" offset="2864099">He quotes Weston and reaffirms everything that I've I said.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.821" offset="2883430">Of course, Governor Hughes started the great debate with his message... As governor with his message to the General Assembly of New York in January of 1910 and that produced the language and the 16th Amendment came into focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.817" offset="2947377">There was this great debate which was joined in by Senator Bora, by Senator Elihu Root, and President Taft himself, on the basis of the apparent success in persuading the public, the 16th Amendment was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.339" offset="3013520">Hughes twice took a curtain call on the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.446" offset="3029924">He was a Justice in the case of Brushaber against Union Pracific, the first case following the adoption of the 16th Amendment, which held that it merely sought to accomplish that which Pollock denied, the right to tax rents, interest, and income.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.249" offset="3113098">Hughes, of course, writing Willcutts against Bunns as Chief Justice, reaffirms all of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1034.657" offset="4274711">This particular financial burden goes to the basic premise in the Constitution of federalism, something which has been guaranteed to the states since constitution law started.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.905" offset="4319746">You can trace it back to McCullough versus Maryland if you wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.498" offset="4330091">But, each day this law is in effect... In Texas alone, you have at least one issuer going to market, paying somewhere between $5,000 and $14,000 in registrar fees that they didn't have to pay before a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.413" offset="4417758">Now, you are talking of each one of 3,395 Texas issuers goes to market one time, about $17 million annually in additional registrar costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.500" offset="4478153">These are costs that these issuers did not have to bear before.</text>

            <text syncTime="1382.623" offset="5666620">If the Court concludes, contrary to our submission, that the Anti-Injunction Act is not a barrier, we are not reluctant to meet South Carolina's constitutional challenge.</text>

And, all that is involved here is an indirect... is only indirect requirement that all obligations which extend for more than a year, no matter by whom issued, whether by the United States, by corporations, by states and municipalities, if issued to the general public, shall be in registered form.</text>

            <text syncTime="1639.377" offset="6693650">Now, the burden imposed on the states as a result of this is surely less than the burden imposed by many other federal regulations, including the one I have just mentioned, the requirement of withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.634" offset="6758643">And, as to the costs, the additional costs imposed on the states, we have not attempted to produce counter affidavits, but it is fair to surmise that there would be offsetting economies in the area of insurance and handling, and, of course, the statute does not require that the bonds, though issued in registered form, be issued through certificates.</text>

            <text syncTime="2381.728" offset="9663041">I say that the legislative bar imposed by the Anti-Injunction Act, just like the legislative bar imposed by statute of limitations, just like the legislative bar imposed by the Norris-LaGuardia Act which, in turn, supplied to all the courts of the United States, which this is one, does apply here, and, hence, if it prevents the District Court from hearing the case, likewise prevents this Court from doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.432" offset="9805879">This Court, however, may choose not to determine that issue and may, as a matter of its own discretion with an eye to the congressional policy, determine that it is inappropriate for this Court to do the business which other courts have been prevented from doing in obedience to a legislative policy of such longstanding and with such obvious salutary reasons behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.836" offset="9955508">And, therefore, as a matter of discretion, if not as a matter of necessity, this Court ought to decline to entertain the action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2478.483" offset="10050071">Justice Stevens, I am aware of that case and it is very relevant to the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.886" offset="10083717">I take it, however, that the way in which it was dealt with by this Court's opinion in the Bob Jones case indicates that in the Court's view it is no longer good law any more than the case on which it was based, the Beechnut case which had, in the Court's terms, eroded, if not scuttled, the Anti-Injunction Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.529" offset="10214225">In Allen, which was a five to three decision on this point, the Court felt constrained to allow, not as an original suit, to concede that the anti-injunction action there did not bar a suit to challenge the requirement that the University collect amusement tax on tickets sold at football games.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.014" offset="10356226">And, that may be very comparable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.199" offset="10392902">But, it does seem to us that that was a circumvention of the anti-injunction statute and, more importantly, it seems to us that the Court has so treated in its now current opinion in Bob Jones University versus Simon, and, indeed, in the companion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.876" offset="10495616">The argument the other way was put as eloquently as could be in the Americans United case by the dissenting opinion of Justice Blackmun and... But, that view did not prevail and it seems to us that that view is precisely the view of what had been embraced by the Court in the Allen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.709" offset="10610973">Let me say one final thing with respect to the question of Marbury versus Madison and our argument seeming in contradiction with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.543" offset="10706267">Marbury versus Madison, of course, holds that the Congress cannot add to the Court's original jurisdiction, and, indeed, an argument could be made that, therefore, invoking the Declaratory Judgment Act here would be adding to the jurisdiction of this Court in some sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.675" offset="10790800">We would not make that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.408" offset="10801771">And, in the same vein, we would not hear say that the anti-injunction action, statute, takes away from the Court's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.372" offset="10857568">It simply instructs all courts of the United States when they may hear a controversy, not what controversies they may hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.459" offset="10898006">And, it cannot be different, whether the rule is that it is too late to hear it, as in the case of the statute of limitations, or too soon to hear it.</text>
