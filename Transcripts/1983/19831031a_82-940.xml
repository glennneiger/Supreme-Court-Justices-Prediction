            <label>Mr. Emmit J. Bondurant, II</label>
            <text syncTime="70.508" offset="430373">I don't think the Court was misinformed as to the intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.749" offset="447300">The lower courts in this case held that because the Respondent was organized as a commonlaw partnership, acts of discrimination, which the complaint alleges, were practiced by that firm in the selection of partners were outside the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.271" offset="517413">Thus, even though the complaint specifically alleged, and the lower courts accepted it as true, as, of course, they must for purposes of ruling upon a motion to dismiss, that the firm engaged, pursuant to a 100-year pattern and practice, of discrimination against women in the selection of partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.402" offset="589929">The lower courts nevertheless ruled that that discrimination was outside the coverage of Title VII and that Title VII afforded the Petitioner no remedy for that discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.853" offset="643741">An analysis of this case must begin, of course, with the statutory language of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.477" offset="666206">There is no question in this case that King &amp; Spalding is not an employer or a person covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.079" offset="692642">That is undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.562" offset="698598">It is plainly a firm engaged in the practice of law in the course of interstate commerce with 15 or more employees and with offices in two cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.077" offset="740603">Nor is there is question in this case as to whether or not Ms. Hishon, an associate for almost eight years with the firm, was an employee of the firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.612" offset="774771">She plainly was an employee as an associate.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.165" offset="788982">The question in this case rather is whether or not the particular acts of sex discrimination which the complaint alleges were practiced by King &amp; Spalding, admittedly an employer, against Ms. Hishon, admittedly an employee covered by the Act, were themselves unlawful employment practices covered by Section 703 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.841" offset="887620">We believe that the answers to these questions are in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.905" offset="903921">First, let me point out by stating that the Petitioner agrees with the position taken by the Solicitor General that it is really not essential in this case to reach of the broader question of whether or not the partnership relationship; that is the relationship between an individual partner and the institution itself is an employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.189" offset="993051">For reasons that we have set forth in the brief, we think an affirmative answer to that question is indicated in this and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.453" offset="1022099">However, this case can be decided on the narrower ground, that in her particular position as an associate of the law firm, the opportunity to be considered for partnership on a fair, equal, and non-discriminatory basis was both a term, condition, and privilege of her employment and employment opportunity, both of which were explicitly within the protection of Section 703 of the Act and were, when the firm practiced sexual discrimination in making those decisions, were unlawful employment practices within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.930" offset="1179983">The complaint clearly and specifically alleged that the firm held out and represented to the Petitioner and to all other associates whom it sought to recruit, the opportunity for fair, non-discriminatory consideration for partnership after completion of five or six years' employment with the firm and hard and satisfactory work during that period.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="279.514" offset="1266396">Did they all become partners?</text>

            <label>Mr. Emmit J. Bondurant, II</label>
            <text syncTime="281.364" offset="1273710">No, Your Honor, they all did not become partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.457" offset="1286144">But, the firm held out to the Petitioner and to other associates the opportunity to be so considered and by holding out that opportunity the terms, conditions, and privileges of her employment included the opportunity for fair, non-discriminatory consideration for partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.112" offset="1372766">When that was denied her, and that is what the complaint alleges, that she was not given fair, non-discriminatory consideration for partnership, the firm committed an unlawful employment practice covered by Section 703, which is--</text>

            <text syncTime="342.036" offset="1516440">You can consider all you want to, but if the bottom line is you don't get into this partnership because of your sex, you would still be here making the argument, but you would have to say that the selection of a partner may not be based on that.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="361.199" offset="1593135">You are using too many words then.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.143" offset="1624900">--Certainly from among associates, that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.806" offset="1639529">We also believe that that is true if one were considering partners from the outside, but that is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.780" offset="1667428">This case is strengthened by the fact that the express representations of non-discriminatory consideration were made and it is the opportunity for advancement which every associate possesses in his or her capacity as an employee of the firm which is and becomes both an employment opportunity and a term, condition, or privilege of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.684" offset="1759065">It does not make a difference that the position of partnership is or is not itself within the coverage of the Act, for in the labor cases, this Court has recognized, as have the lower courts, that where a federal statute applies, as in the labor cases, and is violated, it, does not make a difference that the opportunity for promotion is being withheld for an unlawful reason under one of those statutes, even though the the position to which the employee would have been promoted was entirely outside the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.036" offset="1888424">Thus, in this case, the complaint specifically alleged that she possessed in her position as an employee the opportunity to be considered and be promoted to a partner, that it was an opportunity for advancement, that it was withheld on the basis of sex, and, therefore, is plainly within the literal language of Section 703 of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="519.603" offset="2226762">In our view, it would not make a difference if the firm had been silent; that is if the firm's business practices are such that the firm regularly reviews its associates and evaluates them for promotion to partnership and does so on a basis that is prohibited by Title VII, that would violated Title VII even if the firm were silent in terms of representations it makes to an associate.</text>

            <text syncTime="566.613" offset="2414739">We believe that if the firm were silent that it would nevertheless be covered under Section 703.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.816" offset="2439607">That is that the opportunity for advancement which one possesses as an associate adheres in the relationship and that where a firm regularly promotes associates to partnership from that relationship, that that is an opportunity of the employment and an implicit term, condition, privilege of employment that could not be withheld on the basis of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.261" offset="2533335">That case, we believe, becomes even stronger, where to induce one to enter into the relationship in the first instance, the firm holds out the opportunity for nondiscriminatory consideration for employment after five or six years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1380.115" offset="5668760">The legislative history is very clear since 1972 that a central concern of Congress was access of discrimination-against groups, women, and blacks in particular, to the higher professional, managerial, and elite positions of society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.079" offset="5748590">That issue was very centrally camped when an amendment was proposed that would have excluded from Title VII the choice of doctors to practice on the staff of hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.808" offset="5803552">And, Congress rejected that amendment precisely on the ground that it is that kind of highly sensitive position as to which Congress was especially keen that discrimination should end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.335" offset="5853602">Now, in that respect, to us it seems quite irrelevant whether partners themselves are associates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1445.139" offset="5928835">It is clear that if a corporation with ten stockholders wanted to find new stockholders and went out and sold stock to new stockholders that Title VII would not have anything to do with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.337" offset="5981602">But, if that same corporation makes the ownership of stock part of a stock plan for employees, then it cannot ration that on sexual or racial grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1693.151" offset="6920861">If you are a partner in a law firm, you are very careful about selecting new partners because it affects your profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.860" offset="6963702">In other words, you want the strongest possible person regardless of sex, color, or race.</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.194" offset="7061086">Your Honor, this may be a decreasing problem, but when Congress acted, first in 1964, and in 1972, it was a very active problem, it was really a virulent problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.895" offset="7123885">And, that is the time as of which that statute speaks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.099" offset="7140708">So, the fact... and to some extent that it is no longer a problem is itself maybe a product of Title VII in the background; that is to say that since everybody concedes that at the intake stage, when young associates are first hired, Title VII does apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.080" offset="7220642">Of course, law firms have had to accustom themselves to overcoming these ancient prejudices and they have learned, we have all learned, as we have learned on faculty, that, in fact, the prejudice was simply inexcusable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1913.257" offset="7801292">And, as such, it is not a question of are lawyers above the law, but it is a question of whether or not the Congress intended to cover them as to this law, and it is secondly a question as to what protections lawyers are granted by the society and by the law and by the Constitution in order to perform their necessary function in the society.</text>

            <text syncTime="3453.143" offset="13960861">If you take Ferri versus Ackerman, which came out on the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, considered by the same Congress at the same time, their desire was to maintain the independence of lawyers from government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.439" offset="14010076">Now, that desire happens to be something that you go under with with the EEOC, a government agency going after law firms which litigate against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.208" offset="14053126">And, I know, as some others do, that there are times and places in this world when a lawyer defending people, sometimes unpopular and sometimes unpopular causes, had best be able to select his own partners because if he can't or she can't, he is not going to be on the firing line defending the rights expressed by the highest Court and the highest ideals in our country.</text>

            <text syncTime="3631.378" offset="14673795">Justice Powell mentioned the profit motive, that it is inconceivable in 1983 that one motivated by profit would turn down a competent partner.</text>
