            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="72.362" offset="444513">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.731" offset="457992">This case presents questions of fundamental importance to the orderly administration and adjudication of the millions of claims that are filed under the Social Security Act each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.106" offset="503445">Congress has enacted a special self-contained procedure for the administrative and judicial review of Social Security claims, and it has assigned to the Secretary of Health and Human Services the responsibility for prescribing the administrative steps in that process that must be pursued before a claimant seeks judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.619" offset="585469">The Court of Appeals in this case, however, excused the respondents from exhausting the administrative procedures the Secretary has prescribed before they sought judicial review within the special statutory procedure that Congress has enacted, and in addition, the Court of Appeals held that respondents could challenge the Secretary's interlocutory decisions denying their claims outside of that special procedure by bringing a separate action under the general grants of subject matter jurisdiction in Sections 1331 and 1361 of the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.477" offset="736980">We have sought review in this case because the Court of Appeals' decision is flatly inconsistent, in our view, with this Court's prior decisions in Weinberger versus Salfi and later cases with attached legislative history and consistent administrative implementation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.004" offset="803017">If the Court of Appeals' interpretation were affirmed by this Court, the interlocutory and piecemeal review of the Court of Appeals has permitted would substantially disrupt the administrative and judicial review of Social Security claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.680" offset="861740">There is a pressing need in this area involving many claims for the Secretary and the courts to have clear rules that can be easily and uniformly applied in all cases without the need to litigate in particular cases their applicability, and the rules the Secretary and Congress have established for this purpose are fair and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.945" offset="954841">Before stating the facts of this case, I would like to briefly outline those procedures that Congress and the Secretary have prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.801" offset="986188">The basic statutory framework is simple and straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.503" offset="1001025">It is contained in Section 205 of the Act, which was enacted in 1939, and is now codified in Section 405 of Title 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.443" offset="1036761">Section 405(b) directs the Secretary to make findings and decisions on claims for benefits under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.881" offset="1066540">Section 405(b) then provides that if the claimant is dissatisfied with the Secretary's initial determination, the Secretary must afford him an opportunity for a hearing on the claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.106" offset="1111471">Mr. Kneedler, can the claim be made before the surgery?</text>

            <text syncTime="242.808" offset="1126204">No, under the Medicare program, as under most insurance programs, the claimant files a claim for payment which can be made only for services that have already been rendered.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="253.866" offset="1170508">Then how it is possible for someone who wants the surgery performed to get a determination about reimbursement before having the surgery?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="263.055" stopTime="288.853">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="263.055" offset="1207288">The Act does not provide for this sort of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.589" offset="1225365">The administrative procedure that Congress has established, particularly Section 405(b), refers to determinations and hearings on applications or determining the rights of people who have applied for payment under the Act, and a person wouldn't even have a right to payment until he applied for benefits after having the surgery.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="288.853" offset="1310420">Well, under your view, is there any way at all that a person could get that kind of determination--</text>

          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="295.091" stopTime="328.180">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="295.091" offset="1335393">Well, the person could request, I suppose, the Secretary to perhaps offer advice, but for part of the reasons, I suppose, that were developed in the preceding case for one of the intermediaries to suggest the particular service might be covered before the person has even had the surgery might create problems, and ordinarily the intermediary would decline to do that.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="328.180" offset="1467781">--Well, for someone looking at elective surgery, something that isn't going to done no matter what, and of modest means, it does put them in a difficult position, doesn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="340.888" stopTime="369.574">

            <text syncTime="342.924" offset="1526714">In the typical Medicare claim situation, the rules are fairly well established, and by reference to what private insurance carriers do, but even quite aside from whether... from any policy of general applicability the Secretary has, in any individual case, surgery can only be paid for if it is reasonable and necessary, and that is a determination that could not be made until after the individual had the surgery in any event.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="379.097" offset="1671432">No, that he... he is in a position where he wants this procedure, but can't afford to pay for it, and how does he find out?</text>

          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="389.468" stopTime="489.215">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="389.468" offset="1712914">Well, as I say, there is no established procedure for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.336" offset="1728379">As it turns out in this case, the physician who is responsible for most of the... or virtually all of this particular surgery is adjudicating claims on... as the representative for other claimants who have had the surgery, so in this particular instance, that doesn't present a problem, because the question of the coverages will be litigated anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.333" offset="1816359">As I was saying, the Act in Section 405(b) provides for administrative hearings, and then also authorizes the Secretary to conduct such other proceedings as are necessary to determine individual claims, and immediately after Section 405 was enacted in 1939, the Secretary established a four-level procedure for administrative review of claims, an initial determination, a reconsideration, the hearing required by the Act, and Appeals Council review.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.173" offset="1951674">Then the special provision for judicial review is contained in Section 405(g), which provides for review only of the final decision of the Secretary, and the Secretary's regulations since 1940 have made clear that the final decision subject to judicial review is that rendered after the Appeals Council has looked at the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.051" offset="2023249">And then, to make clear that all challenges to decisions on Social Security claims are channeled through Section 405(g), Section 405(h) provides that no decision of the Secretary shall be reviewed in any other manner except... by a tribunal in any other manner except under 405(g), and Section 405(h) says that no action may be brought under any of the general grants of jurisdiction.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="489.215" stopTime="519.603">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="489.215" offset="2111856">Mr. Kneedler, as to surgery performed after the Secretary's new regulation, and under the regulation it provides that this particular procedure would never be reimbursed, approved for reimbursement, why doesn't it fall under the Mathews against Diaz exception as a waiver of exhaustion requirements?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="519.603" stopTime="589.161">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="519.603" offset="2233483">Well, the basis of the Court's decision in Mathews versus Diaz was the same as that in Salfi, and that was... first of all, those cases both were limited to a very narrow situation that is really somewhat unique, and that is where the claimant is challenging the constitutionality of the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.295" offset="2300252">In those circumstances, there were... in both those cases there were special factors present.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.599" offset="2317388">The claimant conceded that there were no facts in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.718" offset="2329927">The claimant conceded that the Secretary's interpretation of the statute... he didn't quarrel with the Secretary's interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.805" offset="2358243">All other issues were resolved except for the constitutionality of the Act of Congress, which was beyond the Secretary's competence to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.161" offset="2391680">And even then the Court held in Salfi that just because a court might believe that exhaustion of remedies would be futile does not furnish a basis for the court to excuse exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.302" offset="2444238">What the Court held, though, in Salfi was that the Secretary's failure to contest the allegations of exhaustion would be deemed a waiver of exhaustion in the circumstances of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.509" offset="2489065">That was the rationale explicitly that the Court adopted in Diaz.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.377" offset="2504529">Similar circumstances--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="589.161" offset="2511634">But, Mr. Kneedler, in Diaz, the Secretary did raise the exhaustion point.</text>

            <text syncTime="595.817" offset="2538279">I would note that the District Court rejected the motion to dismiss in Diaz on the ground that exhaustion would be futile, which was a ground that was subsequently rejected by this Court in Salfi.</text>

            <text syncTime="631.453" offset="2680803">For two of the claimants, Clara and Diaz, the Secretary conceded that under the rationale of Salfi, because there were no facts in dispute and the statute... there was no quarrel about the interpretation of the statute, that there would be jurisdiction over those two.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.248" offset="2744020">The only ground that the Secretary objected to jurisdiction over the third, Espinoza, which the Court discussed, was that the Secretary hadn't issued a decision at all on the claim, and as it turns out, the reason the Secretary didn't is because the District Court had entered a temporary... or an injunction barring the Secretary from issuing such a decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1801.625" offset="7361528">The second question, which I will come back to after addressing the first, is a question that the Secretary completely ignores, and that is the one of how are Medicare beneficiaries who are too poor to advance the cost of treatment and obtain the surgery ever able to file a claim to exhaust their administrative remedies or to obtain a determination of their eligibility for benefits?</text>

            <text syncTime="2298.826" offset="9350283">Why wouldn't it have been possible for someone in 1981 who could afford the operation... there are such people, I am sure, in the area where this doctor practices... to have the operation and then start this whole proceeding and challenge the regulation in that proceeding, and then Mr. Ringer could get the benefit of that ruling if it held the regulation invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.889" offset="9426560">The problem with that, Justice Stevens, is that as we have set forth in our brief, and as the complaint indicates, Mr. Ringer is a person who is suffering right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.412" offset="9460624">He has severe respiratory illness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2330.561" offset="9477238">And denying him access to benefits which the Administrative Law Judges are almost consistently ruling he is entitled to puts him in a situation of suffering pain, of suffering disability, and there is the possibility that Mr. Ringer may be dead and may never have the opportunity to take advantage of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3399.316" offset="13752333">No, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.999" offset="13759020">There have been ten different Administrative Law Judges, 26 proceedings, and they have occurred all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.970" offset="13778874">I think if I could leave the Court with one point, I think that point would be that in the District Court, in the Court of Appeals, and in this Court, the Secretary has stated over and over again that the intent and the effect of that ruling is to bind the Administrative Law Judges and the Appeals Council and to absolutely prohibit reimbursement for this treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.085" offset="13871347">I think that that fact brings this case squarely within this Court's holdings in Salfi, in Eldridge, and in Diaz, and as much as the Secretary wants to ignore the rulings in those cases and to quote language from those cases, those decisions found jurisdiction at least as far as the named plaintiffs were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.230" offset="13951909">Each of those cases found jurisdiction under Section 405 despite the fact that the plaintiffs had not completely exhausted the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.021" offset="13991092">In fact, Salfi points out that the named plaintiffs had not satisfied the finality requirements imposed by the Secretary's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.460" offset="14024843">In Eldridge and Diaz, there was a concession that there had not been complete exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.595" offset="14045427">More than that, each of those cases found jurisdiction under Section 405 despite the fact that the Secretary had moved to dismiss in each case for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.653" offset="14093597">Indeed, in Eldridge, the Court notes that the Secretary made out the same argument that she makes here, that this Court is bound by her determination on finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.361" offset="14136438">And the Court answered that very simply: We disagree; and proceeded to look to the merits of the finality question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.532" offset="14165172">It suggested in each of those cases that exhaustion was unnecessary because the Secretary had taken a conclusive position on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.120" offset="14199549">In Eldridge, it was as a result of a statutory provision... excuse me... as a result of the impact of the Secretary's regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.428" offset="14236748">In the other two cases, it was the result of a statutory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.261" offset="14248033">But that is precisely the situation that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.665" offset="14261721">Diaz in particular supports the result of the Ninth Circuit, because the Secretary's counsel in colloquy with the District Court there as far as one plaintiff is concerned insisted that the decision... that benefits could not be awarded to that plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.893" offset="14338625">And I think that while the Secretary never comes right out in saying it, what she's telling you is that she wants you to overrule Salfi, Eldridge, and Diaz.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.732" offset="14369972">She is actually asking this Court to hold that it cannot do precisely what it did in each of those three cases, that you cannot look behind a motion to dismiss, or a statement that further exhaustion is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.724" offset="14421904">But I think there is more to it than that, because when you see the big picture, what the Secretary, I think, is really saying is that this Court is bound by her determination on finality but that she can't be bound by the decisions of the Administrative Law Judges within their jurisdiction or by the decisions of the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.287" offset="14496196">I think that when you put this in perspective, the Secretary is asking for a license to continue to ignore decisions even within the jurisdiction in which those decisions were rendered.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="3625.428" offset="14656692">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.864" offset="14670485">I have several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.816" offset="14674247">First, I would like to point out that it is my opponent who is asking this Court to overrule Salfi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.720" offset="14697861">This Court could not have been clearer in Salfi that a court cannot substitute its judgment for whether exhaustion of the administrative remedies would be futile for that of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.658" offset="14737672">If the prohibition in the 1980 Heckler ruling that the respondents challenged here had been in the statute under Salfi, the Court could not have waived exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.149" offset="14783647">The Court said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.833" offset="14786364">The basis of the finding of jurisdiction in Salfi was that the Court deemed the Secretary to have waived exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.989" offset="14814994">This would seem to follow a fortiori from Salfi, because here it is a regulation, an issue arising under the statute, not a question beyond the competence of the Secretary, as in Salfi, the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.880" offset="14866508">There is no stipulation here, as in Salfi and Diaz, that the facts are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.034" offset="14891167">There is no stipulation here that the respondents and the Secretary agree on the interpretation and application of the statute in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.806" offset="14922201">Those are the very reasons why exhaustion of administrative remedies is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.441" offset="14940800">While respondent argues in this Court that the Secretary has taken a firm position on this ruling that won't be changed because of this binding regulation, the respondents have argued in the administrative proceeding that that regulation is not binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.601" offset="14997434">Not only is it not binding on the people who had the surgery before 1980, but they argued that it wasn't even binding on the people who had the surgery after 1980, because of the particular interpretation of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.576" offset="15045290">That is the very reason why exhaustion of administrative remedies should be required even when a person is challenging the regulations, because it gives the Secretary, through the Appeals Council and the ALJ's, the opportunity in the first instance to decide whether the regulation applies and what the statute means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.137" offset="15115612">The other point I would like to make goes to the question of Mr. Ringer having standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.976" offset="15146958">The reason Mr. Ringer cannot bring a lawsuit is because Congress has foreclosed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.928" offset="15166707">The only available way of judicial review is under Section 405(g) of the Act, which requires a filing of an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.034" offset="15195128">Congress foreclosed judicial review under 1331 and 61, and the system would break down with 200 million Medicare claims filed a year on behalf of people who have already had services if beyond that a claimant could seek a declaratory judgment when it is still speculative as to whether he would be reimbursed for the surgery.</text>
