            <label>Mr. Anthony J. Parrillo</label>
            <text syncTime="62.224" offset="387807">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.176" offset="391568">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.504" offset="400868">This matter is here on appeal from the Third Circuit's decision declaring preempted a provision of New Jersey law which disqualifies certain labor union officials on the basis of state proscribed criminal or quasi-criminal conduct from association with our casino gaming industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.089" offset="475265">That provision, Section 93 of New Jersey's Casino Control Act, is but part of a larger comprehensive statutory and regulatory scheme of casino control which is designed not only to prevent the industry's infiltration by criminal elements or their agents, but also to avoid any public perception that such a foothold is even available.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.906" offset="590517">The issue the is whether New Jersey's exercise of its police power over conduct incompatible with the well regulated casino industry impermissibly clashes with rights accorded unions and their members by federal labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.023" offset="654987">The facts here are not in dispute, and are basically a matter of historical, judicial, and legislative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.255" offset="687901">In 1976, New Jersey, within the sole confines of Atlantic City, legalized casino gambling, and spawned an industry that had been criminally outlawed for over 200 years in our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.827" offset="746207">Intended as a tool to revive a decaying region in our state and to fund worthy programs for the benefit of our seniors and handicapped citizens, the casino gaming industry is vitally and strongly affected with a deep public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.384" offset="824365">No matter how great its rewards, New Jersey would tolerate casino gaming only if it were regulated and controlled in such a manner as to avoid any risks to which the public would be exposed by legalizing this heretofore unlawful activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.201" offset="903673">Thus, aware of the uniqueness of the industry, its historical susceptibility to crime and corruption, and the documented hazards associated with gambling generally our legislature enacted the toughest and the tightest set of casino rules perhaps in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.258" offset="979846">The very prospect of such comprehensive legislation was the basis upon which New Jersey citizens consented to casino gaming in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.800" offset="1018089">The distinction between this business of casino gaming and useful trades and occupations is substantial, and it compels a state regulatory interest in every aspect of casino activities, as well as those ancillary enterprises and individuals involved either directly or indirectly with a licensed casino operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.540" offset="1113070">Our legislature included within this latter class casino hotel labor unions, because by virtue of the relationship, of their relationship with the licensed employees they represent, and the licensed employer they collectively negotiate with, such unions are positioned to exert significant control and influence over the conduct of legalized casino gaming in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.449" offset="1232607">Thus, Section 93 of our Casino Control Act is basically an information gathering device for the state, and it requires that each union representing casino hotel workers as well as its leadership register and file disclosure forms with the Casino Control Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.362" offset="1336261">This information in turn assists the sister agency, that is, the Division of Gaming Enforcement's investigation into whether these casino labor officials have engaged in any of the essentially criminal or quasi-criminal conduct proscribed by another section of the Casino Control Act, and that is Section 86.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.149" offset="1439496">If proof of such conduct is uncovered, the Casino Control Commission is empowered to hold a full evidentiary trial type hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.612" offset="1489338">Upon finding a disqualifying event, the Commission may order that sanctions befall the union if the disqualified official remains in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.136" offset="1559451">These sanctions, the ban on dues collection in employee benefit plan administration, whether applied singly, as in this case, or jointly, serve only to encourage the removal of the disqualified officer, and decidedly not to disqualify the union as an entity or as an organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.546" offset="1661015">The rest is history.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.952" offset="1670628">In 1978, appellees Local 54 as well as its leaders did register and file the requisite disclosure forms with the Casino Control Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.887" offset="1710439">When the results of the Division of Gaming Enforcement's investigation were reported to it, the Commission scheduled a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.696" offset="1745652">After appellee's motion in the Federal District Court to preliminarily enjoin the proceeding was denied, the Commission proceeded to a hearing and a decision, and that decision found three of Local 54's officers disqualified in accordance with the statutory criteria of Section 86.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.844" offset="1830288">The Commission then ordered that if these three individuals were to remain in union office by a certain day, then the sanction of a dues collection ban would follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.025" offset="1878981">The Commission determined not to invoke the other remedy available to it, and this order, of course--</text>

            <text syncTime="601.254" offset="2543849">That is not part of our statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.377" offset="2556388">Whether that remedy is available to the regulatory agencies in New Jersey is at this point an open question of state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="643.844" offset="2714272">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.015" offset="2726915">I would now like to briefly outline our four-point program of legal argument, which will focus in on whether Section 93 is preempted by the Taft-Hartley or Landrum-Griffin Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.465" offset="2768711">I would, with this Court's permission, and if there are no questions, I would like to rely upon our brief for the other issues involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.665" offset="2797550">Our legal argument will begin with an analysis of the scope of the federal right in issue, namely, Section 7 of the Taft-Hartley Act, which appellees contend is totally preemptive, and which we submit on the basis of DeVeau versus Braisted in the 1959 Congressional enactment of Landrum-Griffin is necessarily less than absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.982" offset="2890755">We will then proceed to establish a Congressional intent to accommodate in certain limited instances the ability of the states to... the state here to impose disqualification standards more stringent than those of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.164" offset="2951568">Such an intent is gleaned from essentially three events.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.103" offset="2967242">Number One, the Congressional acquiescence in 1953 in state imposed eligibility standards upon a certain class of labor union officials, namely, those involved in the waterfront.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.955" offset="3010710">Second, the affirmative grant of state authority explicit in Section 603 of Landrum-Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.548" offset="3037041">And three, DeVeau's express ruling and appellees' proper concession that Landrum-Griffin does not preclude states from operating in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.667" offset="3077479">Given the absence of a compelling Congressional direction to prevent, we will then demonstrate how Section 93 serves a unique and compelling state interest which on balance outweighs the minimal impact, if any, on the Section 7 right.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.113" offset="3151353">The particular susceptibility of the state created and public interest charged industry to crime and corruption instinctively evokes the police power of state government and readily distinguishes this case from any other which may come before this Court in the labor preemption field.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.779" offset="3225959">Finally, we will show that the means by which New Jersey enforces its casino labor control program, particularly the ban on dues collection invoked in this case, is a necessary and permissible adjunct to our power to legislate disqualification standards for casino labor officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.473" offset="3312790">This case involves the choice of labor leaders, and in our view Section 7 of Taft-Hartley is neither as express nor as absolute as appellees or for that matter the Third Circuit majority would have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.871" offset="3374334">Indeed, Mr. Justice Frankfurter writing for the Court in DeVeau versus Braisted declined to decide that case mechanically on an absolute concept of free choice.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Anthony J. Parrillo</label>
            <text syncTime="834.347" offset="3476212">--There were, on the issue of whether the Landrum-Griffen Act preempted state... the New York Waterfront Act, there were five votes, Mr. Justice Brennan concurring in the opinion, and particularly on that portion of the opinion which dealt with the Landrum-Griffin Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.728" offset="3569730">Mr. Justice Frankfurter spoke for four justices, a plurality, on the view that the National Labor Relations Act did not preempt all states' regulation of the employee freedom of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.314" offset="3644127">In any event, Justice Frankfurter decided to weigh the competing interest involved and to determine whether Congress would have intended to preempt the state legislation that was in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.995" offset="3710791">If there be any doubt on that score, well, Congress itself in 1959, through the enactment of Landrum-Griffin, established that the Section 7 right was not unfettered, and that national labor policy admits of some limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.768" offset="3777978">Indeed, Section 504 of that Act establishes minimum standards for and prohibits certain individuals from holding union office.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.609" offset="3813296">Thus, Section 7, even if it ever did, does not now guarantee unlimited employee freedom of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.262" offset="3851957">That choice is obviously and necessarily limited by the operation of federal law itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.712" offset="3877661">Equally clear is that national labor policy allows some state regulation of the complete freedom of a group of employees to designate representatives of their own choosing.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.691" offset="3937639">In fact, DeVeau held that Section 8 of the New York Waterfront Act which permanently disabled all expellants from serving in union office did not deprive a Section 7 right, but merely placed a limited restriction on its exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.277" offset="4007960">This holding is all the more significant when one considers that New York law was prohibiting certain convicted individuals from holding union office even though federal law would have allowed them to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.286" offset="4059996">Earlier, in 1953, Congress had approved the bi-state compact which was later at issue in DeVeau, and expressly endorsed the state's supplementing legislation, of which Section 8 was a part.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.173" offset="4123526">In lending its support to New York's method of enforcement, Congress clearly indicated that it did not view all state regulation of union officer qualifications as incompatible with federal labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.835" offset="4190190">On the contrary, Congress manifested its general willingness to tolerate in certain limited situations more stringent state regulation even if it included a component which restricted the Section 7 right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.488" offset="4252780">This conclusion again is reinforced by the passage of Landrum-Griffin in the absence of an express provision within Section 504 preempting state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.810" offset="4306070">This was a telling omission, since as other sections of Landrum-Griffin indicated, where Congress meant to preclude the operation of state laws, it left absolutely no doubt on that score, and to make the matter conclusive, Section 603(a) of Landrum-Griffin affirmatively preserves the operation of state laws such as Section 8 of the Waterfront Act and by necessity Section 93 of the Casino Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.857" offset="4430308">Justice Frankfurter stated for the DeVeau plurality Section 603(a) is an express disclaimer of preemption of state laws regulating the responsibility of union officers, and again, Mr. Justice Brennan, providing the fifth vote on that ruling, concurred that Landrum-Griffin explicitly provides it shall not displace such legislation of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.206" offset="4543679">Confronted with this clear pronouncement of the Court, it is not surprising that appellees concede on Page 27 of their brief that</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.265" offset="4579937">"It is clear that Section 504 does not preempt. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.511" offset="4596865">the states from establishing more stringent standards for labor union officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.651" offset="4617449">While the Taft-Hartley Act does not preclude every state policy that may restrict the Section 7 right, neither admittedly does it condone all state incursions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.876" offset="4686412">Rather, whether state regulations should be allowed because of the deeply rooted nature of the local interest really involves, as this Court has counseled and commanded in Jones, Farmer, and Sears, a balancing of the state interest against any harm to the federal regulatory scheme established by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.616" offset="4781289">Well, here a compelling and demonstrable need exists to go beyond the federal norm in our unique and localized casino industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.815" offset="4834161">That gambling is a distinctively state problem to be governed and controlled by the states is abundantly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.780" offset="4870001">As part of New Jersey's overall program of casino integrity, Section 93 stands as a prophylactic measure designed to keep this cash intensive industry free from the risk of crime or its taint through the back door access provided by ancillary services and including labor unions that are associated with the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.740" offset="4973864">The standards for disqualifying casino labor officials achieve that statutory goal by removing such unacceptable risks from positions where they can exert influence and control over casino operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.106" offset="5047320">The exercise of such a compelling state interest neither interferes with the primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board nor does it impermissibly infringe on a substantive federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.880" offset="5118373">As to the former, well, the objectives of New Jersey's law and those of the labor boards are really mutually exclusive and don't provide any opportunity for collision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.577" offset="5177201">I think this is most evident in the exercise of the board's jurisdiction in industries such as casino gaming in Nevada and the waterfront in New York and New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.805" offset="5238119">The boards' jurisdiction has historically successfully coexisted with enforcement of local laws in those extensively state regulated industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.659" offset="5285452">As to the federal guarantee, well, we know from DeVeau, we know from Congressional acquiescence that Section 93 does not deprive employees of their choice of labor representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.764" offset="5349923">Again, it merely imposes a limited restriction which, as in DeVeau, as here, it is both narrow in scope and historically explained, which is perfectly compatible with the less than absolute nature of the federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.256" offset="5423901">If, then, New Jersey can validly disqualify certain casino labor officials, it necessarily follows that New Jersey can enforce its lawful demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.122" offset="5487327">Thus, Section 93 provides for a ban on dues collection which was invoked in this case, but solely as a means to effect the removal of the disqualified officer from the union, and from, more importantly, association with our casino industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.630" offset="5581368">The dues collection ban, we submit, is a reasonable and necessary means of achieving the statutory purpose of Section--</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.763" offset="7189883">Our argument in this case that the state law is preempted by the National Labor Relations Act as amended rests on Hill versus Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.679" offset="7245576">We have set out the essence of the reasoning in Hill on Pages 15 through 17 of our brief, the red brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.470" offset="7304718">Hill was a case concerning a Florida statute which prohibited individuals who were not citizens of ten years' standing who had been convicted of a felony or who were not judged to be of good moral character from serving as union officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.147" offset="7419448">Moreover, the statute had certain registration requirements and enforced those requirements as well as the requirement I have just stated by injunctive and criminal proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1838.608" offset="7493322">Mr. Gold, to what extent do you think the case of Local 926 versus Jones, decided in 1983, cuts back on Hill against Florida, where the Jones opinion indicated that something that touches on interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility requires a balancing, and could tip it the other way?</text>

            <text syncTime="1873.859" offset="7634279">Your Honor, we don't believe so, for the following reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.591" offset="7657266">As this Court has recognized throughout the development or the modern development of the preemption doctrine in labor law, there are two distinct parts, or maybe it would be more accurate to say there are two distinct doctrines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.911" offset="7738455">One concerns substantive supersession, situations in which the state law conflicts directly with the federal law, and where under all normal supremacy clause analysis, and going back to cases like Hines versus Davidovitz, there would be preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.246" offset="7831869">The second doctrine is the doctrine based on the primary exclusive jurisdiction of the labor board, and that doctrine was first stated in the Garman case in 359 US, whereas Hill was decided back in 325 US in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.392" offset="7920476">The Court has made clear, and Jones is a Garman case, the Court has made clear that there is an exception to the Garman doctrine for state regulation deeply rooted in local feeling, and that that exception to the Garman doctrine is to be administered through a balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.722" offset="8041789">It isn't simply that the state interest may be deeply rooted, but it also concerns the relative impact on the board's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.969" offset="8082749">There is no case of which we are aware in the other branch of the doctrine that concerning substantive supersession, which employs a balancing test, and we do not think this is a happenstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.571" offset="8165191">It seems to us to be a principal distinction between these two different types of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.161" offset="8199464">It is not, with all deference to this Court, to balance where there is a substantive conflict between federal and state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.139" offset="8259441">As noted in a very recent case which we cited and set out in our brief at Page 41, the Fidelity Federal Savings and Loan versus De La Costa, a case which is in 458 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.084" offset="8351183">Where the Court concludes that there is substantive conflict, the determination is that Congress has weighed the different interests, and no matter what the state law means to the state, the supremacy clause applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.481" offset="8416803">The Garman rule is a more far-reaching rule than substantive supersession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.932" offset="8442612">It guards against potential conflicts in administration which may have an effect on the law, a potential conflict which the Court has determined is inconsistent with Congress's plan in setting up its single administrative agency in elaborating that doctrine, as I say, because it is more far-reaching, and because the conflict is different kind, the Court has applied a balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.795" offset="8566014">For that reason, we suggest that one of the three principal arguments made by the state in this case, namely, its reliance on Garman and deeply rooted in state interest exception to Garman as a reason for doubting the continuing force of Hill is mistaken, and is wrong in theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.360" offset="8696313">I would note just to complete this point that the distinction I have stated between these two different preemption doctrines is articulated in the Court's opinions, most notably in the Railway Trainmen opinion for the Court by Justice Harlan, and is a basic element of a very recent decision last term in Bellknap versus Hale, where the Court applied a balancing test only with regard to the Garman preemption claim and not to the other preemption claim made in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.155" offset="8883454">The Hill case, as I said, concerned the Florida statute I have just described, and with the Court's permission, because, as I say, it is the bedrock of our argument, I would like to quote portions of the full reasoning of the Court which is set out, as I said, on Pages 15 to 17 of the red brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.420" offset="9036532">The Court there stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.668" offset="9049488">"The declared purpose of the Wagner Act as shown in its first section is to encourage collective bargaining and to protect the full freedom of workers in the selection of bargaining representatives of their own choice. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.816" offset="9118138">"Congress attached no conditions whatsoever to their freedom of choice in this respect. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.987" offset="9146768">"Full freedom to choose an agent means freedom to pass upon that agent's qualifications. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.561" offset="9181145">"Section 4 of the Florida Act circumscribes the full freedom of choice which Congress said employees should possess. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.588" offset="9229211">"To the extent that Section 4 limits a union's choice of such an agent or bargaining representative, it substitutes Florida's judgment for the workers' judgment. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.958" offset="9286680">Chief Justice Stone concurred in that portion of the Court's opinion, and as the court below noted, the statute at issue here replicates the vice of the Florida statute exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.369" offset="9372362">It is the state that makes the determination rather than the employees as to who will be their agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.971" offset="9418755">The state law as well in practical terms as Justice O'Connor points out runs afoul of the second holding of Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.824" offset="9494197">Hill also held that even a proper registration requirement could not be enforced by means which would constitute an obstacle to collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.708" offset="9565668">There is no need for surmise here on the effect of a dues remedy, if I can use the word "remedy" in this context, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.042" offset="9631079">There are undisputed affidavits from the union that it cannot act as the collective bargaining representative for some 85 to 90 percent of its membership if there is an absolute state bar for those people paying a penny to the union as dues.</text>

            <text syncTime="2433.037" offset="9870987">It seems to us as it appears to have struck the Court that the decisive difference between the Hill case and this case on the one hand and DeVeau on the other is that Congress had acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.994" offset="9958863">Congress is not limited to making such exceptions to its general rules as Congress chooses to make, and in DeVeau, New York and New Jersey had gone to Congress and asked for approval of a compact and a compact which Justice Frankfurter underlined gave Congressional authorization to enabling legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2554.456" offset="10356656">And in those terms, we do not believe that DeVeau, the ruling in DeVeau changes the law of substantive supersession.</text>

            <text syncTime="2609.089" offset="10575248">There is one other factor which was heavily relied on by the Court and it is this added factor which seems to me to make the question a particularly difficult one, or one of the two reasons I think it is a particularly difficult one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.501" offset="10656855">New Jersey and New York did not simply come to Congress and say we have a feeling that a compact is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.651" offset="10709413">We would like to extend our authority because there are certain possibilities that we can envisage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.569" offset="10745149">They came to Congress and said, there is persuasive evidence detailed in hearings held in New York and New Jersey and held by Congress that there is a very, very substantial problem in the New York-New Jersey waterfront, and that extreme measures are necessary to deal with that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.200" offset="10855699">And Congress, the reports show, was convinced of the soundness of that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.820" offset="10898122">Now, I had no basis for judging, and I don't know how one would go about the process of whether Connecticut could make a sufficient showing and what is a sufficient showing for Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.767" offset="10965936">I think that the situation therefore is that those states that wish authority in this area have to make their case to Congress just the way anyone who wishes, any state authority that wishes authority which is contrary to general federal principles has to make the case to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.350" offset="11064261">It may be that the sheer number of requests will have one of two effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.693" offset="11093622">First, to cause Congress to change the general rule rather than to make ad hoc exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.264" offset="11123924">Or, to repent of its one exception on the ground that it has proved unwise, and it is the proverbial camel's nose under the tent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.165" offset="11183483">That is for Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.838" offset="11190171">That is uniquely for Congress, and there is, we submit, no showing that Congress has repented of what it has done in general terms in the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.671" offset="11269583">Indeed, we would suggest that the 1947 legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Amendment tends to prove exactly the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.606" offset="11329247">Congress, as the Court knows, completely rewrote the National Labor Relations Act in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.271" offset="11379924">In the legislative deliberations, Congress was conscious of and referred to Hill versus Florida, and to Bethlehem Steel versus New York Board, both of which stand for the principle that it is not open to the states in industries covered by the National Labor Relations Act to regulate any aspect of the representation process, that that... that such state regulation is inconsistent with the federal scheme, and Congress in light of those determinations made two specific judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.329" offset="11588172">First, as a proviso to Section 10(a) of the National Labor Relations Act, there is a special permission for the Federal Labor Board to enter into agreements with state labor boards to administer the law so long as the law is substantively consistent with the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.193" offset="11695588">To that extent, Congress recognized and dealt with the problem presented to this Court in the Bethlehem Steel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.920" offset="11750550">It did not do what New York had wanted in the Bethlehem Steel case, namely the right to regulate whether or not the state law was absolutely consistent, but only on an undertaking of consistency.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence E. Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="3233.377" offset="13072345">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.268" offset="13075898">But in terms of the industry specific question, it seems to us that the issue here is akin to and is answered in principle by the arguments made by the public utilities and the states that wish to regulate public utilities in the Wisconsin Board case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.212" offset="13171715">The argument there was that while Congress had regulated the right to bargain collectively and the right to strike, it had regulated those activities in a fashion which showed that they are not absolute rights, because Congress had placed limits on the rights, and therefore the states could in industries that were "local" and of particular importance to the state, and that had historically been regulated by the state, impose additional requirements not permitted by federal law and not enacted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.459" offset="13348721">And the Court rejected that argument, recognizing that the National Labor Relations Act is general in terms, and states general principles, and that in the Act Congress made a conscious determination to regulate to the full extent of its commerce power, and Congress has in fact made certain industry specific exemptions and exceptions to its rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.570" offset="13481110">Section 8(e) and Section 8(f) deal in specific terms with the construction and garment and apparel industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.453" offset="13536698">Section 8(g) deals specifically with the hospital industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.607" offset="13561253">There are specific provisions which deal with industries that are national in scope, the so-called emergency strike provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.665" offset="13597511">And Congress can and has and may make such exceptions to its general rules as it wishes, but where you have a general principle, as we do have, and as Hill states, either for employee free choice or for collective bargaining for the states to add or subtract to the federal rules in this area seems to us to be plainly inconsistent with the most elementary preemption principles.</text>

            <text syncTime="3403.496" offset="13752888">Mr. Gold, let me ask you to go back for a moment to the concern about whether DeVeau out back on Hill at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.210" offset="13779741">There is the one sentence that I have looked at several times toward the bottom of Page 152 of Justice Frankfurter's opinion in which he says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.784" offset="13810043">"Obviously, the National Labor Relations Act does not exclude every state policy that may in fact restrict the complete freedom of a group of employees to designate representatives of their own choosing. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.718" offset="13853720">Do you think that sentence is consistent with Justice Black's opinion in the earlier case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence E. Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="3433.624" offset="13873364">I think that it may be consistent with it in the way that Chief Justice Stone pointed out in his concurring opinion in Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.130" offset="13947343">Chief Justice Stone said there are no immunities in this statute from state penal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.594" offset="13977227">If that is the limit of Justice Frankfurter's cryptic statement, I think that there is no inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.389" offset="14028427">Certainly it is such a muted call for Hill's limitation or rejection that we would hope it would not be read as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.644" offset="14105436">I think if I can I would like to spend a moment on Section 504 of the LMRDA, the provision in which Congress stated certain limits on the right to run for and hold union office, and I wish to make only two points about that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.634" offset="14217345">First of all, as I have just noted, Congress has limited the right to bargain collectively and the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.693" offset="14253603">The Court has recognized, and it seems to me to be indisputable, that Congress's limitations do not mean that the states can move into the field and either add or subtract, and in that regard, I do wish to stress in particularity the difference between Section... a critical difference between both Section 504 and Section 8 of the Waterfront Act at issue in DeVeau.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.915" offset="14382543">Both those sections were limited to individuals who had been convicted of felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.176" offset="14419532">While the Court did not use the term, it was in the nature of an added penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.408" offset="14452447">The New Jersey statute sweeps well, well beyond any such limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.324" offset="14484107">This statute is triggered by an administrative determination that there is a reason to believe that somebody who has never committed a wrong is associating with other people who may or may not have committed a wrong but do not have to have been shown to have committed a wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.364" offset="14580342">Moreover, there is a disqualification for</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.425" offset="14592568">"failure to cooperative with the Commission. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.985" offset="14606778">and to supply information not merely relevant to the Act under the language of the New Jersey statute, but information requested by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.277" offset="14647947">I think we are exactly back into the area covered by Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.023" offset="14674905">It is this Commission created by New Jersey which is going to make a highly subjective, unfocused judgment which will override the judgment of the employees, unless, as the court below held and as we believe is compelled by both the statute and precedent, the New Jersey law is declared preempted.</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony J. Parrillo</label>
            <text syncTime="3665.746" offset="14801861">Just very briefly, in response to a question by Justice O'Connor, Mr. Gold said that this Court should pay no deference to balance where there is state substantive conflict with a federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.551" offset="14861106">Well, that justification for preemption is really a function of the strength of the argument that Section 7 does in fact absolutely protect the conduct at issue, and of course here we submit that Section 7 doesn't lend that absoluteness ascribed to it by appellee or by the Third Circuit majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.012" offset="14950863">With respect to Hill, we are not asking this Court to overrule Hill, just to recognize that subsequent developments have limited the scope of Hill's applicability and require that it be substantially restricted to circumstances not here present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.521" offset="15020976">In any event, Hill can be clearly distinguished from this case in at least four distinct aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.189" offset="15047621">In the first place, the Florida regulatory scheme, as Justice White had recognized, was applicable across the board to all labor unions operating in the state of Florida, whereas New Jersey's law only affects--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3741.388" offset="15104463">Yes, but what do you say about his reliance on the Wisconsin case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.574" offset="15117106">The public utility case.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Anthony J. Parrillo</label>
            <text syncTime="3745.962" offset="15122749">--Your Honor, the strike cases are, Number One, Wisconsin acted to totally abrogate the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.100" offset="15163291">Number Two, Congress, we contend, was much more specific and clear when it spoke about the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.721" offset="15189727">In fact, this very same section they announced the right, they also announced the qualifications and limitations on that right as to leave no doubt that they had occupied that field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.390" offset="15232463">What Congress did in Section 7 on the contrary talked about a right to collectively bargain through representatives of one's choosing, as Judge Becker noted in his dissent, a rather amorphous way to create an absolute protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.744" offset="15293799">The second ground for distinction of Hill is that Florida plainly substituted its judgment for that of the worker by requiring affirmative proof of good moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.396" offset="15336430">Under the New Jersey scheme, there are no prerequisites for functioning as a casino labor union in our state other than filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.264" offset="15371957">Third, and most significantly, Florida was an out and out attempt to regulate labor unions and their agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.513" offset="15400901">The sole purpose was to require them to license and then additionally to prescribe affirmative qualifications for licensure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.402" offset="15432456">Absent in Hill was the compelling state interest that we think New Jersey has demonstrated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.600" offset="15461296">Fourth and last, the operation and application of the Hill statute directly conflicted with the NLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.627" offset="15489403">It enjoined a union from operating as such, enjoined the business agent from operating as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.923" offset="15510510">Again, New Jersey's sanction is a dues collection ban designed only to encourage the removal of the disqualified union officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.415" offset="15552515">Equally unavailing are appellees' efforts to essentially write off DeVeau because of the presence of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.304" offset="15596088">Well, he doesn't recognize that four Justices declined to infer a Congressional intent to preempt all state regulation, regardless of the presence of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.940" offset="15650631">The compact was brought to Congress in the DeVeau case because it was constitutionally required to approve or at least to be brought to its attention a compact between two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.791" offset="15714056">And thirdly, of course, DeVeau was not decided on any one factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.025" offset="15734954">It was decided on a number of factors, the most important of which was a weighing, a balancing of the federal and state interests, and that Congress first... excuse me, the Court in DeVeau first determined that the Section 7 right was not absolute, then engaged in the balancing test.</text>
