            <text syncTime="65.608" offset="383933">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="72.178" offset="410264">This case is here on direct appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1252 from the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.368" offset="446940">Under review is the District Court's decision holding unconstitutional the investigative provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, specifically the Court's holding that the Fourth Amendment prohibits the use of an administrative subpoena for the inspection of documents and rather requires that a search warrant be obtained before any documents may be examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.983" offset="541399">Because some of the briefs here have generated some confusion about the issue presented I think it would be useful to summarize briefly the background of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.689" offset="584240">On January 6, 1982 Al Godes, the Wage Hour compliance officer, telephoned Appellee, a restaurant-motel, located in Steele, North Dakota to schedule an inspection for the following day and to ask that certain wage and payroll records be made available for inspection at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.935" offset="669295">When Appellee's manager informed Godes that the time was not convenient he rescheduled the inspection for the following week.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.041" offset="701686">In the interim Appellee's counsel wrote to Mr. Godes stating that Appellee would not consider the request for an inspection until it was informed of either the nature of the complaint that triggered the investigation or the scope of the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.070" offset="769814">The government responded with a letter outlining the general scope of a fair labor standards investigation and declining to give the reason for this particular investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.377" offset="815058">In this letter the government rescheduled the inspection for two weeks hence.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.697" offset="840344">The letter also requested Appellee to inform the government whether it would decline to permit the inspection so that an administrative subpoena could be obtained in that event.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.803" offset="880677">Appellee responded that permission would be refused under the authority of Marshall v. Barlow's and thereafter Appellee was served with a subpoena duces tecum requiring production of specified payroll records at the Department of Labor's Wage Hour Offices in Bismarck, North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.316" offset="962806">Appellee's counsel informed the Department of Labor that it would not comply with the subpoena on the ground that it was invalid under Barlow's, and to date it has not produced the subpoena documents.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.274" offset="1010558">Mr. Horowitz, do the Appellees suggest that maybe this was really an attempt by the government to get unauthorized entry into the premises?</text>

            <text syncTime="238.820" offset="1076805">All we know is that they phoned and... The government phoned and said that it wanted to conduct an inspection the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.490" offset="1107420">Appellee obviously did not feel compelled to comply with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.127" offset="1126019">It simply first stated that it wasn't convenient and then later declined to permit the government to enter.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.051" offset="1261752">--If they did I think unlike this case Barlow's would be quite relevant and there would be a serious question under Barlow's, but the question would be whether Barlow's was distinguishable or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.007" offset="1305533">It might be difficult to distinguish.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.357" offset="1314937">Barlow's itself was careful to confine itself to the OSHA context so arguably it might be distinguishable, but it would certainly be a close case.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.302" offset="1378676">The subpoena specifically said that it was returnable off the premises, that the documents were to be produced at the Labor Department's office in Bismarck, North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.740" offset="1416501">I should say also in response to Justice O'Connor's original question the Appellee has said and the briefs in this Court have characterized the Department of Labor's initial phone call as sort of a demand for entry and tried to paint the picture that we were trying to force our way in.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.904" offset="1501138">That's something that's come up in the course of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.040" offset="1509706">I think if you look at the more contemporaneous discussion of what was going on the letter that I just referred to that Appellee sent to the government that is reproduced at page 13 of the Joint Appendix Mr. Peterson stated</text>

            <text syncTime="369.353" offset="1598940">So I think at least at the time everyone understood that this was just a request to enter the premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="413.998" offset="1777513">In the course of the court's opinion he states that the Appellee's contention is that they are not required to turn over these documents in response to this subpoena so the court seems to have understood that what this case was about was a subpoena, but then when it gets to drafting the order it just says that government can't enter on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.811" offset="1860792">At that point the government filed a motion to amend the judgment pointing out to the court that all we wanted was for the documents to be turned over at our offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.667" offset="1900184">The court did not really address that very well either so perhaps the District Court did not exactly focus on what was going on here, but I think it is made clear enough in all the papers that have been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.344" offset="1950862">When Appellee declined to permit the inspection originally the government responded with a letter that outlined the general scope of the investigation of a fair labor standards general investigation but declined to give the reason for this particular investigation, and as I said we requested that Appellee inform the government whether it would consent... decline to permit the inspection so the subpoena could be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.927" offset="2061203">When Appellee declined to permit the inspection a Department of Labor officer went to the premises on February the 2nd and served him with the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.033" offset="2101641">The Appellee brought this law suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that the Fair Labor Standards Act was unconstitutional and quoting from the complaint</text>

            <text syncTime="514.513" offset="2179590">This action was consolidated with the government's action as discussed earlier petitioning the District Court to compel Appellee to comply with the subpoena, and the District Court found for the Appellee without really explaining why.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.440" offset="2235283">The court's opinion relied exclusively on Marshall v. Barlow's and accepted the Appellee's contention that the subpoena was invalid under Barlow's.</text>

            <text syncTime="669.263" offset="2798588">At the outset let me emphasize again that the only issue presented in this case is the constitutionality of the subpoena duces tecum served upon Appellee, that is, requiring the production of documents off premises without resort to a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.540" offset="2867655">Perhaps because the validity of such subpoena is so clearly established by this Court's precedent Appellee and the amicae supporting it have sought to cloud this issue by suggesting that this case involves an attempted nonconsensual entry onto private premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.902" offset="2937141">This is simply not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.687" offset="2944246">There is no question here of an entry onto private premises without consent as there was in Barlow's.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.840" offset="2968906">The government never made any attempt to enter and the Department of Labor's general policy is not to make such entries.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.761" offset="2996596">From the time the subpoena was served almost every document in the record perhaps with the exception of the District Court's opinion confirms that this litigation has focused on the validity of the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.652" offset="3044139">Only one week after the subpoena was served Appellee wrote the government, sent a copy of this letter to the District Court stating that it would not comply with the subpoena because it was invalid under Barlow's.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.645" offset="3096070">Appellee's complaint, the government's petition to enforce this subpoena, the District Court's own description of the issue presented in its opinion and the motions for summary judgment all focus on the issue of the validity of the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.738" offset="3160436">On this issue Appellee's contention is foreclosed by a long line of precedent of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.825" offset="3184782">In Oklahoma Press this Court unequivocally held that an administrative subpoena, indeed in that case a subpoena issued under the very statute involved here, the Fair Labor Standards Act, a subpoena is not governed by the requirements of the warrant clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.604" offset="3247894">That is, neither a warrant nor probable cause is required for the issuance of a subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.091" offset="3269837">The Court explained that a subpoena does not involve any actual search of private matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.261" offset="3294601">It is a search only in a theoretical sense, what the Court termed a constructive search.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.248" offset="3318529">The Court concluded, therefore, that a subpoena is reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment if the request is authorized by law, is not indefinite or unduly burdensome and seeks documents that are relevant to the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.158" offset="3378088">This rule has been reaffirmed by this Court in Morton Salt and several other subsequent cases and has been routinely and uniformly applied to administrative subpoenas for the last 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.883" offset="3425004">Neither Appellee or the District Court discusses Oklahoma Press and its progeny.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.167" offset="3446215">No defect in the reasoning of the Court in those cases nor any reason for concluding that those cases were wrongly decided has been suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.956" offset="3481324">The sole basis for the decision below and for Appellee's argument is the assumption that this long line of cases has been wiped off the books overruled sub silentio by Barlow's.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.366" offset="3530957">There is absolutely no basis for this assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.652" offset="3544122">Barlow's has nothing to do with this case or with Oklahoma Press.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.120" offset="3561990">Barlow's involved an actual search, an entry onto a manufacturer's private business premises and a search of those premises for evidence of safety and health violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.761" offset="3608592">This is the precise sort of investigative tool with which the Court in Oklahoma Press contrasted a subpoena and drew a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.700" offset="3644328">Barlow's did not suggest any erosion of the traditional distinction between subpoenas and actual searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.623" offset="3672018">Indeed Barlow's relied heavily on See v. City of Seattle an earlier case where the Court had established a warrant requirement for fire inspections, inspections that required an entry onto private premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.947" offset="3729278">In the course of that decision, however, the Court expressly reaffirmed the distinction drawn in Oklahoma Press between subpoenas and actual searches and reaffirmed the standards set forth there under which such subpoenas are to be judged.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.975" offset="3789360">Barlow's and following See did not interfere with these standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.896" offset="3817050">Morever, the problems with OSHA inspections primarily concerned the Court in Barlow's.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.800" offset="3844739">That is, the unbridled expression of officers in the field to conduct inspections and the unlimited nature of the search involved do not exist with subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.508" offset="3883505">The subpoena is not open ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.941" offset="3893223">It specifically identifies the documents sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.043" offset="3905657">The subpoena is not left to the unbridled discretion of the officer in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.714" offset="3924361">It may be issued only by the Wage Hour administrator and enforced only by resort to adversary court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.700" offset="3952259">In short, nothing in Barlow's casts any doubt on the continued validity of Oklahoma Press or on the validity of the subpoena returnable off premises that was issued in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.491" offset="3995518">Thus, to repeat we believe that well settled Supreme Court precedent clearly controls the disposition of this case and requires reversal of the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.347" offset="4034911">Unless there are any questions, I will reserve the remainder of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.289" offset="6890617">However, in footnote 22 you pointed out that delineating the scope of a search with some care is particularly important where documents are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.065" offset="6949758">At a certain point you indicated it is the secretary's position which we reject that an inspection of documents of this scope may be effective without a warrant.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1716.571" offset="6987792">Well, you can get relief with respect to the scope of the subpoena under Oklahoma Press, under Walling.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard G. Peterson</label>
            <text syncTime="1727.712" offset="7032305">We believe, Your Honor, that because of the entry provisions of this particular statute, Section 11, which there is no question in my mind, there is no question in the District Court's mind and apparently there is no question in the Labor Department's mind, is subject to the warrant clause on Barlow's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.494" offset="7123525">It is very difficult for me to then say Section 11 is subject to the warrant clause; however, the subpoena is not which is the enforcement device.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.052" offset="7173680">I believe that essentially the cases are the same, Barlow's and Lone Steer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.740" offset="7208475">The only difference occurred when entry was denied and an enforcement mechanism under a particular statute was utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.929" offset="7245255">In the Barlow's case it involved a compulsory process to enter, and as I read Barlow's the Labor Department did not contend that that compulsory process was the equivalent of a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.586" offset="7299903">You did indicate that it could be viewed as such in one of your footnotes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.907" offset="7321115">The same is true in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.627" offset="7340028">We have to look at the enforcement mechanism of Section 11, and in this case it is the subpoena, a subpoena that is issued by the Labor Department itself without regard to probable cause and without properly limiting the scope of the investigation to the purpose or the probable cause involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.125" offset="7429993">Again, I would have to iterate and reiterate that the case involved a declaratory judgment at a particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.064" offset="7569801">On February 1, 1981 there was a dispute as to whether or not the Labor Department had a right to come in and conduct an investigation over the objection of an owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.407" offset="7627166">When Lone Steer objected twice through its attorney that you cannot come in without a warrant or its functional equivalent, the Labor Department then cited in its letter its inspection powers under Section 11 to enter and conduct an inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.202" offset="7698323">At that point there was a dispute as far as the District Court was concerned as to whether or not the Labor Department did in fact have a right to enter and inspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.093" offset="7745866">Following the initiation of that law suit the Labor Department despite all these protestations through the legal counsel and through the court system the Labor Department still sought to conduct that inspection on the premises of Lone Steer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.573" offset="7831757">It is--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1928.942" offset="7837295">So what you say is basically you are entitled to a declaratory judgment that would say the Labor Department does not have the authority to enter and inspect notwithstanding--</text>

            <text syncTime="1949.539" offset="7919632">--Yes, they are two distinct issues, but if Section 11 is subject to the warrant clause under a Barlow's test type of analysis it seems clear to me that you have to also apply that analysis to the enforcement mechanism of that right under Section 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.000" offset="7993507">In fact the Labor Department is saying that it is seeking to inspect the documents under the subpoena under Section 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.641" offset="8044080">They are citing Section 11 and Section 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.510" offset="8055574">I seriously question whether or not the Labor Department can conduct its investigation without utilizing the authority of Section 11 which is a right to enter provision.</text>
