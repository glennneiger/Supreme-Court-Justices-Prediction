            <label>Mr. Richard G. Wilkins</label>
            <text syncTime="54.135" offset="341689">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="57.520" offset="355168">On March 31, 1977 the United States commenced a civil in rem forfeiture action in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina seeking forfeiture to the United States of an assortment of firearms seized on January 20, 1977 by special agents by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.702" offset="443984">The forfeiture complaint alleged that Patrick Mulcahey had used and intended to use the firearms in violation of the laws of the United States while engaged as a dealer in firearms without a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.093" offset="497483">The forfeiture was sought pursuant to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. Section 924 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="98.664" offset="519739">Mr. Mulcahey filed a claim for the return of the firearms and also sought to raise his prior acquittal on a related criminal firearms charge to bar the civil forfeiture action.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.071" offset="569372">The District Court on motion of the government dismissed Mr. Mulcahey's collateral estoppel and res judicata defenses noting that the criminal acquittal did not preclude a subsequent civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.981" offset="621095">The parties thereafter submitted by stipulation the transcript of the criminal trial to the court, and the court thereupon found that the government had shown by preponderance of the evidence that the firearms were indeed subject to forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.972" offset="676997">That evidence which is not in dispute here show that during the period when Mr. Mulcahey was not indeed licensed he nevertheless bought and sold numerous firearms including making 16 offers to sell various firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.298" offset="734362">On appeal a divided panel of the Fourth Circuit reversed finding that this Court's decision in Coffey v. United States precluded the section action.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.320" offset="770410">Chief Judge Winter of that court dissented reasoning that while a criminal penalty following a criminal acquittal was barred by the Coffey case that case did not preclude the imposition of subsequent civil penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.847" offset="824536">On rehearing en banc the Court of Appeals adhered to the panel decision by a 5-4 vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.484" offset="847106">The majority again relied on Coffey and rejected the government's argument that it was not applicable on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.221" offset="874064">The court also noted that even if the government's interpretation in Coffey were correct this forfeiture action would nevertheless be precluded because</text>
            <text syncTime="196.993" offset="913144">"there is nothing remedial about forfeiture under Section 924(d). "</text>
            <text syncTime="201.664" offset="931743">Judge Winter joined by three others again dissented relying principally upon his dissent at the panel stage although he also added that while the criminal provisions of the Firearms Act reach only completed violations, the forfeiture provision at issue here reaches firearms that are merely intended to be used in violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.346" offset="1022544">This he said evidences Congress' intent to provide a broad remedial sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.298" offset="1042293">The question in this case, therefore, is whether an acquittal on criminal gun control charges precludes a subsequent civil in rem forfeiture action against those weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.141" offset="1093702">This question can best be analyzed by dividing it up into two interrelated inquiries.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.045" offset="1117317">First, assuming for the moment that forfeiture is indeed civil is there any basis for the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the penalty action is precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.834" offset="1160471">This question is readily answered by established decisions of this Court in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.119" offset="1181578">Therefore, the second question necessarily becomes whether or not Section 924(d) is properly classified as a civil sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.407" offset="1218776">This question is one of statutory construction and is also easily answered because Congress has clearly indicated its intent to provide a civil sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.882" offset="1256706">The Court of Appeals concluded that this Court's decision in Coffey mandated preclusion here because the civil action arose out of the same facts that were involved in a prior criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.892" offset="1316683">While there is indeed some language in Coffey which would lend support to this broad rule of preclusion the subsequent decisions of this Court have given Coffey a significantly narrower reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.731" offset="1360046">In Helvering v. Mitchell the government brought a civil penalty action to recover a $364,000 fine for the fraudulent avoidance of income tax following the taxpayer's acquittal on criminal charges of willfully evading the income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.661" offset="1439772">The taxpayer, of course, faced with this large fine raised his prior criminal acquittal to bar the civil penalty action.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.250" offset="1478120">The Court of Appeals relying on Coffey reversed, but this Court in an opinion by Justice Brande is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.940" offset="1504869">The Helvering court first dispatched the argument that res judicata barred the subsequent penalty action.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.259" offset="1530156">The Court noted reversing the position taken in the Coffey court that the difference in the burden of proof in criminal and civil cases precludes application of the doctrine of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.834" offset="1580520">This Court quite recently in the One Lot Emerald Cut Stones case used the exact same rationale to dispense with the argument that a criminal acquittal collaterally estopped a subsequent civil forfeiture action.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.094" offset="1641542">The Helvering court also dismissed the contention that double jeopardy barred the subsequent action noting that Congress has the authority to impose both civil and criminal penalties for the same conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.135" offset="1689712">Finally, it dispensed with the Coffey objection noting simply that the rule in the Coffey case does not apply when there has been a criminal acquittal followed by a subsequent civil action requiring a different degree of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.061" offset="1741330">Therefore, the crucial question here is not--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="407.513" stopTime="411.632">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="407.513" offset="1755227">In the Coffey case, Mr. Wilkins, was the proceeding civil or criminal?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_g_wilkins" startTime="411.632" stopTime="488.482">
            <label>Mr. Richard G. Wilkins</label>
            <text syncTime="411.632" offset="1771632">--The forfeiture action?</text>
            <text syncTime="414.500" offset="1783126">It was an in rem civil forfeiture action, and the Court said that this was nominally a civil in rem forfeiture action.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.356" offset="1810606">The crucial question here, therefore, is not whether Coffey mandates preclusion but rather whether Section 924(d) is properly classified as a civil sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.663" offset="1859821">This Court's decisions clearly indicate that this is a question of statutory construction that proceeds on two levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.084" offset="1885421">First, the Court seeks to determine whether Congress either expressly or impliedly has indicated its intent to apply one label or the other; and second, when Congress has indicated its intent to apply a civil label the court examines the particular sanction involved to see whether that sanction is so punitive in purpose or effect as to negate that intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.450" offset="1978939">That analysis shows that this sanction here is civil.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.719" offset="1995971">Perhaps the clearest indication that this sanction is indeed civil is the fact that Congress provided civil procedures for its enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.257" offset="2026169">Section 924(d) incorporates the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code which among other things provide for notice by publication and administrative forfeiture if the goods seized are valued at less than $2500.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="488.482" offset="2079041">Was that necessarily a very persuasive argument, Mr. Wilkins?</text>
            <text syncTime="491.500" offset="2091162">Supposing that the forfeiture provision were extremely stringent, say, you forfeiture $100,000 to the government if you are found with these sort of weapons on you and the government says</text>
            <text syncTime="504.427" offset="2142884">"Well, to show it is civil we will simply have all civil procedures. "</text>
            <text syncTime="509.062" offset="2161379">"There will be no right to counsel and nothing else that would go with a criminal trial. "</text>
            <text syncTime="513.032" offset="2177261">That would not really move the ball much would it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard G. Wilkins</label>
            <text syncTime="515.901" offset="2188755">Well, Justice Brandeis in Helvering said that Congress may not provide civil procedures for the enforcement of punitive sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.773" offset="2224177">In a case that you posit where it was rather clearly quite a confiscatory sort of forfeiture and for rather obviously punitive motives perhaps the court would say, no you could not provide that sort of--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="539.867" stopTime="549.456">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="539.867" offset="2284572">The fact that civil procedures had been provided would not advance the argument that it was a civil rather than a criminal penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="549.456" offset="2322920">--Well, it does to the extent the question here is congressional intent if you are looking at what Congress thought they were doing when they provided this forfeiture statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.728" offset="2360014">The fact that they provided civil procedures they certainly thought they were providing a civil--</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard G. Wilkins</label>
            <text syncTime="565.834" offset="2388435">--The intent to call a particular sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.286" offset="2406303">Is this a civil sanction or is this a criminal sanction?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="573.088" stopTime="581.575">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="573.088" offset="2417483">You mean Congress simply by intending to make this civil can make civil what otherwise would not be?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_g_wilkins" startTime="581.575" stopTime="635.494">
            <label>Mr. Richard G. Wilkins</label>
            <text syncTime="581.575" offset="2451442">Well, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.194" offset="2453950">Of course, as we said in the opinion in Ward there is a two step inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.146" offset="2469728">First you look to see whether Congress has intended it to be civil or criminal and second you ask, well, is it so punitive in purpose or effect as to negate that intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.501" offset="2507135">So there is a second level of inquiry, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.869" offset="2516644">The remedial structure of the Act also indicates that this is a broadly... that this is a civil sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.559" offset="2551335">Forfeiture cannot be ordered as part of the criminal punishment for a criminal violation of the gun control law.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.046" offset="2577353">Forfeiture can be obtained if at all only by bringing a subsequent civil forfeiture action against the firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.283" offset="2602221">Therefore, if this Court were to conclude that forfeiture is somehow criminal it would do quite a bit of violence to the remedial structure of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.175" offset="2641823">The government would be forced to choose between forfeiture or criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.543" offset="2663348">It couldn't have both.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="635.494" offset="2667109">Sometimes, Mr. Wilkins, we see the term "quasi-criminal" apply to these forfeiture proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="677.921" offset="2836801">In fact in other decisions this Court has refused to apply the quasi-criminal sort of analysis to apply Sixth Amendment confrontation rights, the Fifth Amendment double jeopardy clause, for example, any due process requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="725.319" offset="3026450">If the Court were to conclude that it was so punitive in nature and effect as to be properly called a criminal sanction I would assume that it would apply to the entire action, but you noted one very important point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.050" offset="3113385">There is a difference in the elements between the forfeiture actions here and the criminal action, and we believe that that is another strong indication that Congress intended this as a civil sanction because it reaches weapons that are merely intended to be used in violation of the law whereas the criminal sanction only applies to completed actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.146" offset="3189767">Finally, although the court below said there was nothing remedial about forfeiture we believe that this simply ignores that broad prophylactic goals of the gun control legislation that this Court has repeatedly noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.204" offset="3237937">This legislation was enacted to enable the states to control firearms traffic within their borders, and elimination of unregulated firearms that have been set apart or intended for use in unregulated commerce furthers that remedial purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.999" offset="3313170">Therefore, six Courts of Appeals have taken the position that forfeiture under this provision is civil and remedial in nature, and the court below stands alone in its characterization.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.242" offset="3362071">Therefore, the Court is required to take the second step adverted to by Justice Rehnquist, that is, to determine whether or not this sanction is so punitive in purpose or effect as to negate that clear intention that Congress indicated to provide a civil sanction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.704" offset="3435945">This question is rather difficult because the standards to be applied in making it are somewhat vague an ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.726" offset="3476069">The fact that a statute has a severe subjective impact upon an individual cannot by itself suffice to make a statute punitive and criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.717" offset="3524030">The taxpayer in Helvering faced with a $364,000 fine certainly felt punished, yet that was not enough to label that statute criminal nor is it enough that the particular sanction depends on criminally proscribed conduct because this Court has repeatedly noted that Congress has the authority to impose civil and criminal sanctions for the same conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.601" offset="3623504">Therefore, the Court has properly noted the government believes that only the clearest of proof would suffice to establish the unconstitutionality of a statute on this second ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="941.293" offset="3890267">Also the second Mendoza-Martinez factor unquestionably indicates the civil nature of this sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.483" offset="3923077">In rem forfeiture is a traditional civil sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.137" offset="3941676">Indeed the Helvering court noted that forfeiture has been considered civil since the original revenue law of 1789 and has been upheld repeatedly against the contention that it is essentially criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.694" offset="3991935">The other factors I do not know whether it is necessary to go into them at any great length but they all indicate to some degree or other that this is a civil sanction.</text>

            <text syncTime="985.239" offset="4066123">Indeed the only factor that indicates at all that this is a criminal sanction is the fact that it is based on some conduct that is criminalized or that is already a crime, but as the Court noted in Ward just three years ago this indication does not carry substantial weight because Congress can indeed criminalize conduct and also impose a civil penalty for the same conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1062.339" offset="4374473">I think it is important to note that the criminal action alleged in the indictment the identical elements which were alleged in the forfeiture case, hence, the same issues were raised in both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.034" offset="4441242">The same facts were present.</text>

            <text syncTime="1086.171" offset="4469767">No, sir, and different burden of proof, and I will get to that a little later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.925" offset="4484814">But Coffey says and I content that Coffey has not been overruled that where the same facts, the same acts, the same elements have been put at issue and resolved against the government in a criminal case the government cannot later adopt a label, call it a civil case, put the same facts in evidence and issue and have its second bite at the apple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.528" offset="4611246">I think that is the clear out issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.662" offset="4619815">Coffey I say I believe has a very narrow preclusion doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.835" offset="4652520">I do not think it is a broad doctrine at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.602" offset="4659521">I do not think it encompasses Helvering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.787" offset="4672268">I do not think it encompasses Ward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.422" offset="4682822">I do not think it is included in the One Lot Emerald Cut Stones case, and I think each of these can be distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.012" offset="4717199">A careful analysis of Coffey I believe establishes the reasoning of that Court being not res judicata and not even double jeopardy but collateral estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.723" offset="4779997">The same issues cannot be determined twice after having been determined once.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.508" offset="4803194">It does not apply to a civil action after a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.297" offset="4830362">Of course, that is an entirely different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.399" offset="4842691">Certainly after conviction of a violation of the Fireams Act in this case the government could have forfeited the firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.220" offset="4874038">It does not... Coffey does not apply to a subsequent civil action where the issues are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.243" offset="4906117">But Mulcahey was charged with engaging in the business of dealing in firearms without a license in the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.466" offset="4951047">He was put to trial and acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.752" offset="4960138">In the forfeiture case the firearms were charged with being used or having been intended for use by Mulcahey because he did not have a license to deal in firearms, identical issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.845" offset="5024504">The government has in its brief relied a great deal on Stone as saying that this can be allowed because in Stone there was a criminal acquittal and a later civil action, but in Stone the civil action was brought by the government as the owner of the properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.460" offset="5111021">Some timber was cut by Stone on government land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.281" offset="5138293">He was charged with feloniously cutting the timber, and he was acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.768" offset="5164206">In the criminal case... Excuse me, in the civil case then the government as owner of the property brought an action to recover the value of the timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.541" offset="5199315">Hence, there is a vast difference between the status of the government in both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.361" offset="5230557">The Helvering case on which the government relies is vastly different from Coffey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.734" offset="5264099">Helvering did not involve a forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.685" offset="5279877">Helvering involved a civil penalty, a 50 percent tax penalty, and the Court was very careful to say... It distinguished Coffey... it was very careful to say this is a civil administrative remedial sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.903" offset="5380709">Now we contend that there is nothing civil or administrative and certainly not remedial about taking firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.842" offset="5420520">In the One Lot Emerald Cut Stones case the individual on trial in the criminal case was charged with willfully, intentionally, knowingly smuggling into the United States certain contraband items, stones and a ring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.159" offset="5521770">Later forfeiture of the contraband smuggled goods was allowed after the individual was acquitted, but the reason for it and the Court was very careful in discussing Coffey and Boyd and all of the other cases that went on and which had not been overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.155" offset="5609751">The reason was that intent was not an element in the forfeiture of the contraband items.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.242" offset="5634097">Intent was an element in the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.444" offset="5650920">I think we need to pause here for a moment and think about the nature of the goods forfeited in Mulcahey's case, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.438" offset="5698881">None of these firearms were contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.590" offset="5715495">None of these firearms were illegal per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.377" offset="5734616">There was not an illegal automatic weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.127" offset="5745692">There was not a sawed off shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.512" offset="5751230">There was nothing illegal about the guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.614" offset="5763560">The only contention that the government had in either case was that they were being used by an individual who they claim was engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license in both cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1460.380" offset="5966688">One is in United States v. United States Coin and Currency which is cited in the amicus brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.236" offset="5998035">That issue was addressed, and if you recall in that case some gambling proceeds were taken and the Court said that you cannot take things simply because they are intended or there is some suggestion that they are intended to be used in violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.798" offset="6076298">Now the statute does allow that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.333" offset="6082463">But I contend that that furthers our argument that this 924(d) is punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.838" offset="6116526">It expands the punitive nature of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.557" offset="6127393">For example, a firearm used in a criminal act... 924(d) refers to the Gun Control Act or any other criminal sanction, criminal law of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.883" offset="6184654">A typical case would be a person committing a felony with a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.785" offset="6204298">Certainly the firearm can be forfeited, but you expand the punitive aspect of it when you say that any gun intended to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.560" offset="6247348">That weakens the government's argument that this is not punitive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1579.575" offset="6443475">The Court affirmed Coffey in One Lot case and it discussed Coffey explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.637" offset="6523723">It said that collateral estoppel in One Lot Emerald Cut Stones would bar a forfeiture if in the earlier criminal proceeding the elements of the forfeiture had been resolved against the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.381" offset="6582655">That is exactly what happened in Mulcahey's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.884" offset="6596657">The elements were resolved against the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.402" offset="6610763">Coffey did address the burden of proof issue specifically and answered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.592" offset="6643468">It says that the government urges that the difference in the burden of proof in civil versus criminal cases should be something to distinguish the two cases, and the Court went on to say nevertheless the fact or act has been at issue and determined against the United States and all that is imposed by the statute as a consequence of guilt is a punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.627" offset="6771677">There could be no new trial of the criminal prosecution after the acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.181" offset="6789859">That is what the Fourth Circuit held in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.983" offset="6801039">The Fourth Circuit said in the majority opinion that everything in 924(d) is punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.906" offset="6836775">It provides for imprisonment of up to five years, a fine of up to $5000 or both, and a forfeiture of firearms used in violation of that law or any other law of the United States.</text>
