            <text syncTime="53.218" offset="354371">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="56.753" offset="368477">This case is pending before the Court on the petition of Texas to review a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granting federal habeas corpus relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.227" offset="414348">The sole issue involved herein is whether a criminal defendant who invokes his Faretta v. California right of self-representation suffers a constitutional deprivation if standby counsel intermittently participates in the trial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.606" offset="483938">I will first briefly discuss the facts of the case and the holdings of the court below and then will urge the Court to reject the holding of the Fifth Circuit that when a defendant invokes his constitutional right of self-representation, standby counsel must in all circumstances be seen and not heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.317" offset="562723">Respondent's first trial was in San Antonio, Texas in January of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.189" offset="594279">He was convicted and received a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.208" offset="606296">His conviction, however, was reversed due to a defective indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.493" offset="623432">His second trial, and that which is the subject of the instant proceedings, occurred in June 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.516" offset="655510">Again, Respondent was convicted and received a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.468" offset="671393">At this trial Respondent chose to proceed pro se and represent himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.705" offset="692291">The trial court, however, over Respondent's objections, appointed standby counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.359" offset="714861">The record reflects that standby counsel participated intermittently in the trial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.179" offset="738162">Counsel made some objections to evidence, he urged motions to the trial court and presented some argument to the jury.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="157.166" stopTime="159.468">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="157.166" offset="770136">Now, two counsel were appointed, weren't they?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="160.618" offset="783928">Through the briefs I find small mention of Mr. Samples, was that his name?</text>
            <text syncTime="165.689" offset="804199">Did he just sit by and do nothing?</text>

            <label>Ms. Leslie A. Benitez</label>
            <text syncTime="168.391" offset="815066">The record reflects that he participated to a very limited extent by occasionally bringing a matter or two to the attention of the trial court out of the presence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.949" offset="857280">But he did participate hardly at all in the trial proceedings.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="183.651" stopTime="192.089">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="183.651" offset="876088">So your opposition would take the position that the two counsels stood in stark contrast one to the other.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leslie_a_benitez" startTime="192.089" stopTime="226.429">
            <label>Ms. Leslie A. Benitez</label>
            <text syncTime="192.089" offset="909838">I don't believe that Respondent has particularly made that argument, but the record does reflect that that is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.593" offset="935856">Some of the intermittent participation of counsel was overtly encouraged by Respondent, some was done without objection by him, and some was done over his objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.468" offset="983295">The record does reflect, however, that most of the assistance provided by standby counsel did occur out of the presence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.407" offset="1015060">The record also reflects that counsel inexcusably and indefensibly twice cursed, once in the presence of the jury.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="226.429" stopTime="228.145">

            <label>Ms. Leslie A. Benitez</label>
            <text syncTime="228.145" offset="1054034">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.381" offset="1063021">More importantly, however, for this Court's analysis, the record reflects that Respondent himself made the decision to proceed to trial in this case, examined the jury panel and selected the jurors, argued both pretrial and trial motions to the court, cross examined the state's witnesses, chose his defensive theory and strategy, presented and examined his own witnesses, and argued his case to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.651" offset="1176078">There were times during the course of the trial when conflict arose between standby counsel and Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.155" offset="1202096">The record, however, reflects that the trial court always and without exception recognized Respondent's right to make the necessary decisions and sustained the Respondent's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.843" offset="1244833">The District Court on federal habeas corpus review reviewed the entire record of the trial proceedings and held that on the record as a whole the Respondent in this case was accorded his right under Faretta v. California.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.703" offset="1304287">The Fifth Circuit, however, reversed, holding that the limited participation of standby counsel constituted a denial of Respondent's Faretta right, and that the conviction must be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.744" offset="1352457">The opinion of the Fifth Circuit strictly applied Faretta and held that when a defendant invokes his constitutional right to self-representation under Faretta, standby counsel must be seen and not heard and that interference by standby counsel will result in a violation of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="321.491" stopTime="349.058">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="321.491" offset="1427481">Ms. Benitez, under Faretta, do you think a trial judge is permitted, once a defendant invokes his right to represent himself, to say okay, fine, but you are on your own?</text>
            <text syncTime="337.601" offset="1491847">I am not doing to appoint any standby counsel because there are just too many problems such as might have emerged in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.821" offset="1516715">Do you think the trial court is under any obligation to appoint standby counsel?</text>

            <label>Ms. Leslie A. Benitez</label>
            <text syncTime="349.058" offset="1537718">No, I don't believe that the trial court does have that obligation.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="352.343" stopTime="354.212">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="352.343" offset="1550883">Why do so many of them do it, then?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leslie_a_benitez" startTime="354.212" stopTime="397.789">
            <label>Ms. Leslie A. Benitez</label>
            <text syncTime="354.212" offset="1558302">I believe that the trial courts do it because it makes the trial in a case such as the instant case less burdensome to the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.901" offset="1593097">For the trial court to have a party there who is present through the trial proceedings to whom he can refer the pro se defendant when matters arise that require that the defendant be advised of courtroom procedures or other matters which the trial court wants the defendant to be aware of.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.530" offset="1663628">I believe that it is the interest... that trial courts do it for, basically for two reasons: one, so that there will be an attorney there who can bring to the attention of the trial court necessary matters which, for example, counsel notices but the trial court doesn't notice.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="397.789" stopTime="405.061">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="397.789" offset="1732591">Well, of course, when the defendant has elected to go on his own, I would think the trial court would feel relieved of that sort of responsibility.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leslie_a_benitez" startTime="405.061" stopTime="424.559">
            <label>Ms. Leslie A. Benitez</label>
            <text syncTime="405.061" offset="1761744">Your Honor, I believe that the argument to that effect that the Respondent has made overlooks the fact that the trial court also has an interest in the fundamental fairness of the trial proceedings and has an interest in ensuring that a criminal defendant who is going to be convicted pursuant to that court's judgment obtains a fundamentally fair trial.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="424.559" stopTime="448.757">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="424.559" offset="1839693">Are you familiar with some of the cases in which after a defendant asserted his Faretta right to try his own case and the court did not appoint counsel to stand by, and then later that same defendant attacked the results on the grounds that the court should have appointed someone one a standby basis?</text>
            <text syncTime="446.888" offset="1929032">Have you cited any of those cases here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leslie_a_benitez" startTime="448.757" stopTime="615.629">
            <label>Ms. Leslie A. Benitez</label>
            <text syncTime="448.757" offset="1936451">Your Honor, I believe that those that the... that some of those cases have been cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.661" offset="1960065">I believe so because that argument has been raised from time to time by pro se defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.898" offset="1985038">We would urge the Court to reverse the decision of the Fifth Circuit and urge the Court to hold that the essence of the right protected in Faretta is the opportunity for the criminal defendant to manage, control and conduct his own defense, to personally participate in the proceedings, and to personally argue his case to the finders of the fact, and this opportunity the Respondent in this case clearly had.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.549" offset="2095693">Rather than adopt the opinion of the Fifth Circuit, we urge the Court to adopt a standard of review which inquires into whether or not a pro se defendant had a genuine opportunity to act in his own behalf, to manage and control his own defense, and to reject the notion that some assistance provided by standby counsel, even that assistance provided over the objection of the defendant, constitutes constitutional error entitling the defendant to either habeas corpus relief or a reversal of his criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.620" offset="2227977">To hold otherwise, we submit, would totally bind the hands of standby counsel when counsel sees some matter occurring during the trial which might result in a serious due process violation from bringing that matter to the trial court's attention or, in fact, from interjecting himself into the proceedings in time to prevent such error from occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.652" offset="2320033">More importantly, however, we urge that the rigid rule of the Fifth Circuit would place upon the trial courts in these cases the responsibility for sometimes acting in the role of an advocate for the criminal defendant where the court sees that some error is occurring or is about to occur which threatens to undermine the fundamental fairness of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.767" offset="2416581">An example of that happened in the instant case where the record reflects that the trial judge trying this case usually sat to hear civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.706" offset="2456287">When he brought the jury panel into the courtroom, he began to instruct them on basic principles of criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.127" offset="2485963">The trial court then inadvertently and mistakenly advised that jury panel that the Respondent was being tried as a repeater, or a repeat offender, indicating to the jury that the Respondent had a prior criminal record--</text>
            <text syncTime="599.619" offset="2539984">Standby counsel at that point made an objection and pointed out to the trial court that that was error.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.023" offset="2565584">The trial court, recognizing that he had committed error inadvertently, then quashed the entire panel and seated another panel who eventually heard Respondent's case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="615.629" offset="2604036">Ms. Benitez, let me take up once more the subject I asked you about earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.033" offset="2625561">I gather from this last incident you have described that it is the general practice in Texas, the feeling of the trial judge, that a defendant who chooses to invoke his Faretta rights really can't get even a fundamentally fair trial without standby counsel?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leslie_a_benitez" startTime="637.744" stopTime="702.620">
            <label>Ms. Leslie A. Benitez</label>
            <text syncTime="637.744" offset="2692434">No, Your Honor, I can't represent that that is the position of all the trial judges in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.981" offset="2717407">I think it's important to note that in this particular case which was tried in 1972, the trial judge was... this was, of course, prior to Faretta and prior to this Court's opinion recognizing the federal constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.008" offset="2781460">However, in Texas for many, many years a defendant had had a right to proceed pro se, and the Fifth Circuit had long recognized a federally constitutionally protected right to act in his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.335" offset="2830779">What I am urging is that the trial court... the trial court should have the discretion to appoint standby counsel as he does, but also to allow counsel to act almost in the role of an amicus.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.260" offset="2890547">If the trial court perceives that some error is occurring in the trial or if the trial court wants someone there who might bring to his attention error which the trial court commits and doesn't recognize at the time, such as the error which was committed in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="702.620" offset="2951987">Well, what happened, if this was tried in 1972, if this is happening, the federal habeas is eleven years later?</text>

            <text syncTime="711.576" offset="2987827">The Respondent in this case filed a direct appeal, has filed numerous, I believe, five or six state habeas actions and several federal actions also.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.017" offset="3033489">The case is... the Respondent has been litigating the validity of his conviction since that time through the state courts and through the federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="743.097" offset="3113842">Mr. Estelle has resigned as Director of Texas Department of Corrections, and Mr. McKaskle is now the Acting Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.335" offset="3138815">The Respondent in this case argues that there can be no valid reason for standby counsel ever to speak of and voice an objection to the proceedings citing this Court's procedural default cases such as Wainwright v. Sykes and Engle v. Isaac.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.046" offset="3209659">We urge, however, that this argument ignores doctrines recognized by the courts, both state and federal, of plain error and fundamental error, which is error requiring reversal even in the absence of any objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.520" offset="3263576">It is also true that absent some ability on the part of standby counsel to speak up and bring to the attention of the trial court some matter which threatens to undermine the basic fairness of the proceedings, this would have the result of perhaps undermining the finality of criminal convictions also in that if some error were occurring of the trial and standby counsel were permitted to voice objection to it at that time, the trial court would have the opportunity to take remedial action, thus removing error from the case before the individual was convicted and the case went up on appeal before a reviewing court.</text>

            <text syncTime="854.002" offset="3557505">And we would submit that it is this interest of the courts and the state and also the defendants in some finality of the convictions to permit standby counsel to raise some objections to the trial court.</text>

            <text syncTime="878.885" offset="3656980">Yes, that is true, and I think that there is, under most circumstances, a much greater burden on the prosecutor to make sure of the fairness of the proceedings when a defendant is acting pro se.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.527" offset="3703582">But as this Court is aware, and as all courts are aware, error sometimes occurs, and sometimes even inadvertent error can do grave harm to constitutionally protected rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.049" offset="3749662">So we would ask this Court, in addition to recognizing the interest of the defendant in proceeding pro se, to also recognize the interests of both the state and the courts in ensuring that fundamental fairness occurs in criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.695" offset="3820297">While certainly these interests cannot override the interests of the pro se defendant, as this Court held in Faretta, we submit that all interests can be protected if this Court adopts a standard of review on a case-by-case basis which inquires into whether a pro se defendant had a genuine opportunity to manage, control and conduct his defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2910.978" offset="11785345">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.628" offset="11787958">The Court of Appeals... the Respondent contends that the harmless error rule should not apply to denials of the right to conduct one's own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.268" offset="11826514">It is one of those constitutional rights so basic to a fair trial that its infraction can never be treated as harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.607" offset="11855876">It's most obvious logical counterpart is the right to counsel, and this Court in Holloway v. Arkansas... it involved a question of whether the denial of the right to counsel could ever be harmless error, and in holding that it couldn't be, this court held and noted that in the normal case where the harmless error rule is applied, the error is readily identifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.941" offset="11961202">Put that was not the case with the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.876" offset="11976980">Likewise, in this case, the error is not readily identifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.863" offset="11996937">Furthermore, the harmless error rule, at least in its traditional application, involves a result-oriented inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.069" offset="12033718">The constitutional right at stake here, denial of the right to represent yourself, is not a result-oriented right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.972" offset="12065378">It is given to the accused to present his personal defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.276" offset="12082619">Therefore the traditional notion of the harmless error rule is inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.912" offset="12101114">The Fifth Circuit in this case, however, did apply another version of the harmless error rule in which the focus was on the impact on the defense rather than the impact on the result at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.720" offset="12148343">Respondent submits that if the harmless error rule is applied, this is the correct application of that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.642" offset="12180003">Since this case involves a man's right to represent himself, I think it only appropriate that I conclude with a brief statement authored by Mr. Wiggins which he ask I read to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.353" offset="12246877">For sake of perspective, Mr. Wiggins says, I respectfully request the Justices to consider a hypothetical case in which a trial judge forces a defense attorney who is representing a client to accept two other counsel for standby purposes against the wishes of the attorney and allows interference by standby counsels to the same extent as in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.636" offset="12348023">If this situation were ever to occur in a trial, it can be seen more clearly that the state's genuine opportunity to defend argument is without merit and totally unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.626" offset="12395984">If an American citizen's right to present a defense without counsel is at least equal to one's right to have counsel, then that defendant should not be required to have an albatross about his or her neck any more than should the attorney who would be trying to defend a client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.124" offset="12473933">For these reasons, Respondent respectfully prays that this Court affirm the judgment of the Fifth Circuit?</text>
