            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="111.311" offset="585720">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="125.900" offset="644025">This case is here on certiorari from the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.788" offset="667640">It is an antitrust case turning on the construction of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.956" offset="696270">Put briefly the issue is whether a corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary can provide the two parties necessary to provide a combination or conspiracy under Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.544" offset="770562">The wholly-owned subsidiary here is the Petitioner Regal Tube Company which the other Petitioner Copperweld purchased in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.602" offset="826882">Regal was a small manufacturer of structural steel tubing with about 14 percent of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.816" offset="867738">Structural steel tubing is used to support buildings, machinery, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.623" offset="906922">Copperweld was never in this business and did not compete with Regal.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.714" offset="935343">Copperweld manufactures, among other things, wire and cable and tubing which is used to transport gases and liquids.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.144" offset="984976">Upon purchasing Regal, Copperweld caused it to be organized as a separate subsidiary for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.406" offset="1030011">All of the stock in Regal was owned by Copperweld.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.374" offset="1049968">All of Regal's officers and directors were Copperweld's officers and directors and Regal's corporate headquarters are in Pittsburgh with Copperweld.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.961" offset="1112244">The Regal business had been previously owned by Lear Siegler, Inc., a California company.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.549" offset="1150592">It had been run as an unincorporated division.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.831" offset="1167728">David Grohne, one of the counterdefendants below, was president of the Regal Division under Lear Siegler.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.561" offset="1214644">Just before Regal was sold to Copperweld, Grohne accepted a position as Lear Siegler's corporate secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.244" offset="1261456">Within a few months though, Grohne decided to establish his own steel tubing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.506" offset="1294474">In May 1972, he formed the Respondent Independence Tube Corporation which sought bids on tubing mills from manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.172" offset="1353093">By October 1972, his new company gave an order for the delivery of a tubing mill and the supplier was Yoder Company which was one of the defendants below.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.541" offset="1414638">The Petitioners, with the advice of counsel, sent out letters designed to protect Copperweld's interest in designs, plans, drawings, and trade secrets and to prevent third parties from developing reliance interests in dealing with Independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.388" offset="1505962">One of these letters was sent to Yoder.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.966" offset="1524352">Yoder then cancelled its acceptance of the purchase order for a tubing mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.182" offset="1549116">However, Independence found another supplier which furnished the mill and the Respondent Independence commenced operations in September 1974, nine months later than would have happened if Yoder had delivered the tubing mill originally ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.140" offset="1645038">The present suit was commenced in the Northern District of Illinois in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.230" offset="1681400">It contained three counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.513" offset="1694461">The first of these was under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and it alleged that Copperweld and Regal, together with Phillip Smith, the chairman and chief executive officer of both companies, had conspired with Yoder to restrict trade in the market for structural steel tubing.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.407" offset="1794040">The second count alleged that the Petitioners and Smith had attempted to monopolize the market for steel tubing in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.029" offset="1848584">And the third count alleged that the Petitioners and Smith had interfered with the Respondent's contractual relations with Yoder, a state law tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.537" offset="1902605">Before the trial began, the Respondent dismissed this claim under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, that is the attempt-to-monopolize claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.062" offset="1952656">It also dismissed Smith from all counts in which he was named.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.247" offset="1977420">The case thus went to trial on two counts, one under Section 1 of the Sherman Act alleging a conspiracy between Copperweld, Regal, and Yoder, and the other alleging a state law tort of interference with contractual relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.539" offset="2062579">At the trial, the jury found that Copperweld and Regal had conspired to violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.064" offset="2100718">But, it likewise found that Yoder was not involved in the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.150" offset="2137080">It also found that Copperweld, but not Regal, had interfered with the Respondent's contractual relationship with Yoder.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.444" offset="2186190">The jury found damages on the interference with contract claim in the amount of nearly $2.5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.033" offset="2228613">That issue is no longer in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.221" offset="2245331">It is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.625" offset="2250974">The only issue here is whether the tort liability is also an antitrust liability under Section 1 of the Sherman Act with the damages consequently tripled under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.383" offset="2329968">The question at the heart of this case has a long history, going back at least to this Court's decision in the Yellow Cab case in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.501" offset="2382422">The Court's opinion there said that an unreasonable restraint may result as readily from a conspiracy among those who are affiliated or integrated under common ownership as from a conspiracy among those who are otherwise independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.324" offset="2457759">Nearly everyone is agreed that those words were unnecessary to the result in that case, but as Professor Areeda has said, the Court's language has come to have an independent significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.441" offset="2530171">That is, indeed, somewhat surprising since the Yellow Cab case is really one of those phantom cases for the defendants there eventually prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.249" offset="2585446">When the case went back to District Court for retrial, that court found that the operating companies had not been acquired unlawfully and the resulting judgment for the defendants was affirmed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.614" offset="2654931">Since then the problem in various forms has come here in a number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.923" offset="2688159">These are discussed fully in the briefs of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.609" offset="2710833">I rely on all of the arguments there but perhaps I can make a contribution by emphasizing one aspect of our approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.230" offset="2757331">The antitrust arguments treat the question on a broad canvas.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.416" offset="2786066">The antitrust laws are not like the tax laws which spin everything out in great detail so that the role of the courts if often to try to fit the precisely-stated provisions together somewhat like a jigsaw puzzle.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.672" offset="2863075">In the antitrust field, the statutory provisions are general and much of the law has been made by the courts, particularly by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.416" offset="2914066">Because of the need for this general approach in many antitrust cases, it may have been overlooked that the decision in this case can best be obtained by focusing on what the statute does say and specifically on Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.016" offset="3004450">Section 1 and Section 2 are quoted on page two of our brief, the blue-covered brief, and careful consideration of their words will, I suggest, help to resolve the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.762" offset="3063487">Section 1 relates to concerted action, the kind of risk which lies behind the concept of conspiracy and the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.817" offset="3115731">Every contract combination in the form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy shall be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.925" offset="3156169">All of these words contemplate multiple actors.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.970" offset="3176336">It takes two to tango and it takes at least two to make the sort of contract or combination or to enter into a conspiracy of the sort with which Congress was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.962" offset="3240283">Section 2 is the standard anti-remedy for misconduct by a single actor, but it requires a monopoly or dangerous probability of monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.346" offset="3301828">Neither is present here since Regal had only 14 percent of the relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.531" offset="3326592">Moreover, as I have said, the count based on Section 2 was dismissed before trial by the District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.589" offset="3362745">Now let us look closely at Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.260" offset="3373508">It is said that there are two entities, the parent and its wholly-own subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.555" offset="3394615">I suggest that Section 1 is properly construed to apply only when there are two or more parties who are acting independently of each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.912" offset="3448113">Section 1, based as it was on the history of Standard Oil, focuses on the increased economic power, the increased threat to competition which results from the joining together of two or more independent centers of initiative and finance through combination in restraint of trade and that is, indeed, the construction which has been given to the statute in analogous circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="952.749" offset="3951441">Suppose that Regal had persuaded Copperweld to refuse to sell some important component that it produced to a potential competitor or subsidiary of Regal.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.429" offset="4030122">Just assume that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.664" offset="5683046">Most of the difficulty in the lower courts in these cases have come from the fact that they have been unable, in the words of Chief Judge Cummings below, to re-examine the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine root and branch.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.186" offset="5957227">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.901" offset="5984081">The purpose of the Sherman Act is to promote competition, not, of course, for competition's own sake, but, as the Court has pointed out in Northern Pacific and Broadcast Music, as a means to encourage efficiency in the use of resources for the ultimate economic benefit of the society as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.639" offset="6083033">Section 2 of the Act, the Act's build-in paradox, preserves competition by prohibiting competitive behavior that threatens monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.432" offset="6138203">That behavior is prohibited whether engaged in individually or by collaboration and regardless of the form of internal organization the transgressing enterprise has adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.175" offset="6201106">And, Section 2's limitations on competitive behavior are supplemented by the prohibition of unfair methods of competition in Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and by State Unfair Trade Practice laws such as we have seen in this case, the tort action for interference with contractual relations, for interference with business relations, or for business slander.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.321" offset="6321687">All of these as well apply regardless of whether there has been collaboration and regardless of the form of internal business organization that has been involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.673" offset="6367140">Mr. Wallace, has Section 5 as a practical matter been used frequently?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="1563.298" offset="6393681">Not frequently, but there is potential for use there that could go beyond Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.669" offset="6439134">The basic principle of antitrust is that within these relatively peripheral limitations on its individual behavior, each enterprise will be spurred on by the much more extensive prohibitions on collaboration to compete and, thereby, to achieve greater economic efficiencies, whether those efficiencies are in scientific or technological advance, in product design, in improved distribution methods, or in improvements in management such as better utilization of personnel or changes in the form of internal business organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.039" offset="6640590">Now, laws with other objectives such as securities laws or state corporation laws may impose some restriction on an enterprise's flexibility to change its internal business organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.640" offset="6714987">But, the question before the Court today is whether the antitrust laws themselves should be interpreted to impose an additional inhibition on an enterprise's ability to adopt various forms of internal business organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.068" offset="6792727">The view of the United States and of the Federal Trade Commission is that it is self-contradictory for the antitrust laws to be interpreted to impede this particular avenue of achieving efficiencies, to impede this particular way of competing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.294" offset="6881648">We are not dealing here with a paradox like Section 2 that ultimately furthers the overall larger purposes of the Sherman Act, but here we are dealing with a self-contradiction that detracts from the achievement of those purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1712.080" offset="6988750">You have emphasized the internal operations of affiliated group of companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.314" offset="7009648">The Attorney General's committee report in 1955 drew a distinction which may or may not be valid between internal and external activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.654" offset="7043085">What is the position of the Department of Justice today on the views of the Attorney General's committee in 1955?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="1732.385" offset="7069939">We don't believe that that is a valid basis for distinction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.817" offset="7099718">Now, it is true that intraenterprise conspiracy can be referred to or relied on in situations where fortuitously there is reason in furthering the policies of the antitrust laws to find a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.293" offset="7189580">In our brief, we attempted to show that many of this Court's decisions can be explained that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.572" offset="7214762">But, in any instance where it is useful to the objectives of the antitrust laws to do that, it would be equally useful to do it if the same effect were achieved through operation by divisions that had the same external effects rather than the fact that there happened to be a separate corporation in the internal organization of the enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.483" offset="7322386">So, the reliance on the corporate form, seems to us, only to obscure the proper antitrust analysis and at the same time to deter flexibility in organizing the enterprise.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1811.010" stopTime="1825.408">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1811.010" offset="7384453">Would you take the view that the activity shown by this record, if performed by independent corporations, constituted a violation of Section 1?</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.426" offset="7418099">And, if so, why is it worse if they are affiliated?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="1825.408" offset="7442027">Well, I haven't really considered whether there would be a violation of Section 1 if these were independent organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.543" offset="7498660">There certainly would be a basis for at least a rule of reason argument, if not a per se argument, that there was a violation here and there was a finding of tortious interference with contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.959" offset="7584238">The point that I am trying to make here is that while an external effects test seems to implicate antitrust policies and objectives, it really is a form in the intraenterprise conspiracy context of expanding the restraints on unilateral behavior, what is essentially unilateral behavior, without facing up to the question whether Section 2 of the Act should be read that expansively because the fact that that is the form of internal organization of the defendant organization really is a fortuity from the standpoint of the ability of that organization to achieve the same economic result through the same activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.120" offset="7828953">Now, it is true that competition within an enterprise can have beneficial effects and that is perhaps one of the confusing factors in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.377" offset="7901991">But, the proper role of the antitrust laws in our view is to encourage those benefits only indirectly as matters of managerial discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.903" offset="7960087">This becomes very apparent in a very simple example of the kind of beneficial effects that can result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.355" offset="7997808">Rivalry between two clerks in a department store can result in much better service to the customers in a particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.255" offset="8037410">But, it is obvious to everyone that the extent to which the clerks shall compete with each other and the extent to which they will cooperate must be a matter of managerial discretion, that the clerks certainly cannot be cut off from each other in the kinds of exchanges of information that may be inappropriate between independent enterprises and that what counts is that the management of Macy's is competing with Gimball's across the way and will develop whatever mix of rivalry and cooperation within the enterprise that best serves that competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.067" offset="8212744">There is really no difference in principle in the more complicated question of cooperation or competition between divisions of an enterprise like General Motors or cooperation or competition between separately incorporated subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.887" offset="8296022">What we are speaking of here does not, in our view and contrary to the submission made in the briefs on the other side, require the Court to adopt an exemption from the antitrust laws which exemptions are not lightly implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.269" offset="8377524">The question of exemption arises when a statute other than the antitrust laws is being construed to determine whether by implication or otherwise it exempts certain conduct from the scope of those laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.482" offset="8434367">This is a question purely of construing the Sherman Act itself and the exemption cases do not apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.072" offset="8472714">Then in response to one other question, we don't think this can be limited to the 100 percent situation because some of the most pro-competitive aspects of separate incorporation are the ability to diversify the stock ownership to some extent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2270.395" offset="9222011">But, first there are a couple of observations which I believe are important concerning the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.519" offset="9250536">First, there was simply no question but that the acts of Petitioners caused the complete exclusion of a competitor from a market for a substantial period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.825" offset="9299751">That exclusion resulted in a clearly demonstrated restraint of trade under a rule of reason analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.182" offset="9333188">Price competition was frustrated, product supply was reduced during a period of serious product shortage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.520" offset="9374566">These facts are important, we submit, because this Court has always held that the Sherman Act must be interpreted in light of its fundamental objective; that is preservation of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.154" offset="9433080">In this instance, the acts of Petitioners seriously undermined that objective.</text>

            <text syncTime="2500.688" offset="10143193">The distinction between a subsidiary and a division comes from the language of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.873" offset="10175898">This Court has always interpreted Section 1 of the Sherman Act to require the existence of two separate legal persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.213" offset="10209335">An unincorporated division is not a separate legal person and, therefore, would be incapable of meeting that threshold requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.021" offset="10248518">I think it is also important to note that there is some historical explanation to that distinction as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.613" offset="10278925">In 1890, of course, Congress was aware of corporations and, indeed, of affiliated corporations, but autonomous or even the existence of unincorporated divisions did not exist in 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.575" offset="10350709">The statute was framed to be directed toward those kinds of entities which did exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.335" offset="10381743">So, the language itself drew the line... The statute itself drew the line on the basis of independent entity, business entity and along the line of the concepts of common law conspiracy which, of course, also requires the existence of two separate legal persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.388" offset="10474007">There seems to be, we would submit, some substance to this distinction as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.385" offset="10497936">An unincorporated division, while it may, as Your Honor points out, exists with significant autonomy, nevertheless, there are some important things that an unincorporated division is not capable of doing which has significance in the market place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.068" offset="10572750">An unincorporated division is incapable of engaging in a contract in its own name and in its own identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.671" offset="10607127">It is incapable of engaging in a contract in restraint of trade or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.761" offset="10631473">So, we would submit that there is some logic drawing the line where the statute seems to draw the line and that is on the basis of legal entity, because an unincorporated division in reality cannot perform all on the functions that a separately incorporated legal entity can by virtue of the legal privileges which the law attributes to separate incorporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3257.903" offset="13172038">But, even before that, I think it is important to refer to the language of the statute itself which provides every contract combination in the form of a trust or otherwise or a conspiracy in restraint of trade is declared to be illegal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3286.704" offset="13287291">Here it has been concluded unquestionably that Petitioners' activities resulted in an unreasonable restraint of trade under a rule of reasoned analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.170" offset="13329087">The language of the statute was plainly violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.134" offset="13340998">We submit that the basic objectives of the statute and the legislative history support this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.538" offset="13370569">Congress was clearly concerned about the predatory efforts to prevent new competitors from entering into the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.472" offset="13406305">Congress also, I believe, made it clear in the legislative history that affiliated corporations were indeed within the meaning of the combination and conspiracy language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.735" offset="13459385">In 1890, of course, Congress was primarily concerned with the anticompetitive behavior of the trusts, but Congress considered those trusts to be the manifestation of a more fundamental problem at which the statute was aimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.711" offset="13527304">That problem was the suppression of competition by any form of concerted action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.161" offset="13549038">Senator Sherman made it clear that the primary concern of the Sherman Act was not with the creation of combinations by merger or otherwise, but with the anticompetitive acts in which those combinations engaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.030" offset="13616538">The words of Senator Sherman during the legislative debates, I think, are apt for this particular case when he said that if a humble man starts in business in opposition to them, they will drive him down, they will crowd him down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.601" offset="13678814">Then it is the duty of the courts to intervene and that is the kind of activity involved here, that is the kind of activity that Senator Sherman was concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.535" offset="13722595">It is important to recognize that the trusts of 1890 were themselves groups of corporations under common ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.937" offset="13760211">The trust device was nothing more than a group of commonly-owned corporations in which a group of trustees owned all of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.760" offset="13799500">The trusts, however, were evolving into the holding company even in 1890, which is why Congress framed the statute to cover in the language of the statute, combinations in the form of trust or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.457" offset="13866269">Indeed, I believe that it is very important in interpreting the word 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.016" offset="13920499">What did the framers of the statute think the term "combination" meant?</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.107" offset="13936904">Indeed, that term was a commonly understood and well-used term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.742" offset="13959369">In its simplest form, it meant nothing more than the cooperation of two or more persons to achieve a given result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.335" offset="13997821">The framers of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, we submit, meant to use that term as it was commonly used at the time and that is a combination meant any form of a collection of persons or as the trust were a collection of corporations which, when they engaged in a restraint of trade, could be held to violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.792" offset="14115581">In light of this legislative history, this Court has so held in each and every case that has been presented to it which involved this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.740" offset="14155392">I should like to for a moment direct my attention to the relationship between Section 1 and Section 2 of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.234" offset="14213384">Both sections deal with combinations or conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.153" offset="14236998">Section 2 is not limited to individual conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.262" offset="14257478">Indeed, the language of Section 2, I submit, is instructive as to the meaning of combination or conspiracy under Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.992" offset="14296453">Section 2 of the statute with respect to the combination element provides every person... and person is defined to include corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.783" offset="14347549">So, if one reads Section 2 substituting the word 2 says every corporation who shall combine or conspire with any other corporation may violate the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.197" offset="14417243">We submit that Congress meant exactly what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.102" offset="14428842">Section 2, of course, also concerns attempts by individual persons to attempt to monopolize.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.799" offset="14479624">The Petitioners and the government in this case have suggested that this Court should now hold that Section 2 of the Sherman Act, that part of Section 2 which relates solely to attempts to monopolize by single persons, should henceforth be applied and only applied... the only section of the Sherman Act to be applied to restraints of trade among affiliated corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.709" offset="14607310">We submit that that approach strains the language of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.673" offset="14627163">But, there is a more important and fundamental point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.594" offset="14638762">That is that the government's position... that is the attempt to monopolize section should only be applied to these circumstances would, in effect, exempt these kinds of activities from the Sherman Act for this reason, because Section 2, the attempt to monopolize portion of Section 2 has always been held by the courts or at least in recent years to apply only in those situations in which there is a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly as measured by substantial market shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.222" offset="14785361">That would mean in this particular case where two corporations are engaged in different markets, neither one of which having a dominant position in either market, nevertheless combine their activities to suppress competition of third parties, that that activity would be automatically exempt from antitrust coverage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3727.583" offset="15050765">It is a preliminary... It is a threshold question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.301" offset="15061632">And, beyond that it is important, as we point out in our briefs, to apply a substantive standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.251" offset="15089426">And, as we have pointed out, the standard which is appropriate in these cases is the standard which is derived from the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.031" offset="15128610">When presented with issues of this kind in the past, this Court has concluded that there are two factors which should be considered, the effect of the activities of the parties involved on competition and also the operational realities of those parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.038" offset="15200603">The lower courts have applied this doctrine and these concepts not always with the greatest precision we would agree, but the results of the lower court cases are essentially consistent with the two-part analysis which says that whether affiliated corporations should be held to have violated the statute should turn upon two factors, whether they actually functioned in the market place in reality as two distinct economic units and, secondly, whether each corporation undertook activities to suppress the trade of third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.271" offset="15365488">And, as I point out, this is a threshold inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.472" offset="15382311">It is designed to determine whether those corporations are capable of engaging in an antitrust violation and not in whether an antitrust violation actually occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.562" offset="15434660">In addition to that threshold inquiry, it would be necessary to determine that those parties actually formed a conspiracy within the meaning of that term under the cases relating to conspiracy and it would also be necessary to establish that anticompetitive acts were undertaken to destroy the competition of a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.333" offset="15529746">The aspect which relates to the autonomy of operation is designed to determine whether, as in the words of the Court of Appeals in this case, there is enough separation so that it is sensible to treat those two separate legal units as separate economic units under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.104" offset="15628802">When a separate corporation is functioning as separate economic entity into the... in the market place it enters into contracts and other business arrangements which give it some economic influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.923" offset="15692123">When that economic influence is combined with another separate corporation even though an affiliated corporation--</text>

            <text syncTime="3902.462" offset="15750324">--The evidence showed that, as I pointed out, there was an affidavit, among a substantial amount of other evidence, which showed that, in fact, as general manager of the subsidiary had the sole responsibility for operating the subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.923" offset="15836110">The Court of Appeals addressed that question very specifically and in a detailed way based upon all the evidence presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.121" offset="15868920">That was precisely one of the issues that was presented to the Court of Appeals by Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.226" offset="15889296">Was there enough autonomy to meet that test as to whether or not they could be considered separate economic units?</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.208" offset="15929315">The District Court in the post-trial motions and the Court of Appeals all concluded that there was sufficient and substantial autonomy both in day-to-day operations and in policy decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.434" offset="15994203">The second aspect of the test relates to the effect of the activities on third parties, whether or not significant restraints of trade are imposed on third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.274" offset="16049583">In this case, an unreasonable suppression of competition did occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.348" offset="16065779">The Sherman Act was clearly intended to protect competition against such competitive assaults.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.286" offset="16093573">We submit, therefore, that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>
