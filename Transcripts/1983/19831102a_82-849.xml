            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="150592">We will hear arguments first this morning in United States against Mendoza.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.067" offset="186850">Mr. Geller, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="13.261" offset="203568">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.923" offset="218197">This case was brought by Respondent Mendoza in 1978 in an effort to become a naturalized American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.678" offset="253201">It's undisputed that Respondent is not entitled to naturalization under any provision of the immigration laws that are now in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.983" offset="286429">It's also undisputed that the Immigration and Nationality Act expressly provides that an alien may not be naturalized under any expired provision of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.052" offset="334703">Now, despite these seemingly insurmountable barriers to Respondent's naturalization, the district court granted that relief and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.379" offset="380052">The lower courts held that the United States was collaterally estopped to oppose Respondent's naturalization because the constitutional argument presented by Respondent in support of his claim for citizenship had been decided adversely to the United States in a prior district court case involving other unrelated aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.113" offset="470958">And we've sought certiorari to challenge this unprecedented and we believe quite destructive application of collateral estoppel on an issue of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.209" offset="507425">Now, the Court is familiar with the background of this case because it confronted essentially an identical situation in INS versus Hibi, which was decided in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.068" offset="558834">The case relates to events that occurred in the Philippines during the end of World War Two.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.113" offset="586941">Briefly, in 1942 Congress passed the Second War Powers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.176" offset="607212">Section 701 of that Act made it easier for aliens serving honorably in the United States Armed Forces to become American citizens, and Section 702 of that Act provided for the overseas naturalization of aliens who are eligible for citizenship under Section 701.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.080" offset="690909">Now, naturalizations under Section 702 obviously were not possible in the Philippines until 1945, when the Japanese occupation ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.596" offset="740959">And in August 1945 the INS sent a designated naturalization examiner to the Philippines to begin performing naturalizations under Section 701 and 702.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="161.327" offset="795816">Did the Act require the United States to send examiners outside the continental limits for this purpose?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="169.863" offset="829985">Section 702 contemplated that naturalizations would take place overseas.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="175.796" offset="853704">And you maintain that it was required that the United States do that under the Act, not permitted but required?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="181.070" stopTime="352.913">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="181.070" offset="874811">Yes, although Section 705 of the Act gave the Attorney General tremendous discretion in how to implement the Act, and this Court held that in Hibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.380" offset="920055">Almost immediately upon the designated naturalization examiner's arrival in the Philippines in August 1945, the Philippine Government objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.486" offset="964463">It was concerned that a large number of young Filipino men, perhaps as many as 250,000, would seek to become American citizens under this provision and leave for the United States on the even of Philippine independence, which was then scheduled for July 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.669" offset="1037188">In response to this diplomatic complaint, Attorney General Tom Clarke, in consultation with the INS and the Department of State, revoked the authority of the naturalization examiner under Section 701 and 702 and naturalization ceased in the Philippines under these provisions around the end of October 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.131" offset="1127049">The authority of the naturalization examiner was reinstated nine months later in August of 1946 and naturalizations began once again in the Philippines and continued until December 1946, when Sections 701 and 702 expired by their own terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.935" offset="1202282">Now, Hibi, as the Court will recall, was a case brought by a Filipino veteran who did not seek naturalization under Section 701 and 702 until 1967, 20 years after those provisions had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.195" offset="1267274">But Hibi claimed that the United States was equitably estopped from relying on the expiration date of those statutes because of the Government's failure to station a naturalization examiner in the Philippines for the nine-month period between October 1945 and August 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.619" offset="1345015">The Ninth Circuit agreed with that argument and held that the United States was equitably estopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.951" offset="1362360">But this Court summarily reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.061" offset="1370824">The Court held that the Federal Government could not be estopped from enforcing the immigration laws passed by Congress, except perhaps if it had engaged in some affirmative Government misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.312" offset="1423800">But the Court quickly added that the Government had not engaged in any affirmative misconduct in the way it had administered Section 701 and 702 in the Philippines, including by not having a naturalization examiner there for the nine-month period that's crucial to these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.302" offset="1487748">Not long after Hibi was decided, a new group of Filipino veterans brought suit to try to obtain American citizenship under Sections 701 and 702.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.160" offset="1535186">This is the so-called 68 Filipinos litigation in the Northern District of California.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="352.913" stopTime="360.730">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="352.913" offset="1562145">Mr. Geller, why did the Government remove its examiners from the Philippines in '46?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="360.730" stopTime="371.676">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="360.730" offset="1593492">The examiners were removed at the end of 1946 because by its terms Sections 701 and 702 expired and therefore there was no further statutory authority after December.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="371.676" stopTime="387.007">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="371.676" offset="1637273">What role, if any, did the position of the Philippine leadership, the government, have to do with this interruption of service?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="387.007" stopTime="578.341">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="387.007" offset="1698608">Well, the naturalization examiner was withdrawn for the nine-month period between October 1945 and August 1946 because of the objections of the Philippine Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.034" offset="1742703">But the naturalization examiner was reinstated in August 1946 and he served until December 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.358" offset="1775931">At the end of 1946 the statute he was administering expired, and that's why at the end of 1946 he was withdrawn from the Philippines.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.392" offset="1808114">Now, in the 68 Filipinos litigation which was brought in the Northern District of California, even though this Court had just decided in Hibi that Attorney General Clarke's actions in withdrawing this naturalization examiner for nine months did not constitute affirmative Government misconduct, the district court in 68 Filipinos held that this very same conduct constituted a violation of the due process clause, and the court therefore ordered the Government to grant citizenship to the Filipino plaintiffs in that case as a remedy for the due process violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.666" offset="1953250">It's important to mention at this point that 68 Filipinos was not a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.970" offset="1974461">The Government took an appeal in 68 Filipinos and it filed its brief in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.146" offset="2003092">In the interim, however, a new Administration came into office.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.407" offset="2020123">The new Commissioner of Immigration took a look at the case and recommended that the appeal in 68 Filipinos be withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.805" offset="2053769">The Commissioner did not suggest in his memos to the Justice Department that the case had been correctly decided, but he suggested that it would be in keeping with the immigration policies of the new Administration to withdraw the appeal in that case and let those 68 Filipinos become citizens pursuant to the district court's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.115" offset="2130987">There was substantial disagreement within the Justice Department as to this recommendation, but ultimately the appeal in 68 Filipinos was withdrawn in November 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.043" offset="2178739">Now, almost immediately after the decision was made to withdraw the appeal the Justice Department began to reassess whether it had acted wisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.272" offset="2219594">In part, this was due to the fact that the Commissioner of Immigration had been summoned to Capitol Hill to explain the reasons why the Government had decided to drop the appeal in the 68 Filipinos case, even though the district court's decision seemed to be inconsistent with Hibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.349" offset="2279885">The upshot of the Government's reassessment was that in April 1978 the Justice Department decided that henceforth it would continue to oppose the naturalization of Filipino veterans who, A, were not eligible for citizenship under current law, and who, B, had made no attempt to apply for citizenship under Section 701 and 702 during the period of time that those laws were in effect back in 1945 and 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.001" offset="2402556">Now, Respondent Mendoza is one of that category of Filipinos.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.595" offset="2420946">He is not eligible for citizenship under current law and he made no effort to apply for citizenship under Sections 701 and 702 during the period of time that those laws were in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="580.511" offset="2472564">In essence, what you did is accept category one of Judge Renfrew's decision and not category two.</text>

            <text syncTime="596.082" offset="2534840">But I mean in the... how many people are we talking about now and how many do you let in under category one?</text>
            <text syncTime="602.437" offset="2560336">Do we know?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="603.506" offset="2564515">Well, it's hard to make an accurate assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.320" offset="2575800">At the time the memos were written as to whether the appeal should be withdrawn, there was an estimate that there might be as many as 25,000 people who would be eligible for that relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.436" offset="2620313">Now, later on when it was decided to reinstate the Government's position in the spring of 1978, further information led the Government to conclude that the numbers might be much larger, perhaps as many as 75,000, although I must say that the Government's concern--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="632.795" stopTime="638.431">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="632.795" offset="2681753">But then the Commissioner Castillo testified that there were only about 100 actually.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="638.431" offset="2704218">--Only about 100 had applied, although in part the concern was not so much with the number who had applied for relief under Sections 701 and 702, but with the fact that if these people became citizens then all of their relatives would be entitled to a number of preferences under the immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.432" offset="2780287">We have argued, we argued in the lower courts, that in part the decision to reinstate the Government's position in April '78 was due to a reassessment of the number of Filipino veterans who would be subject to these laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.520" offset="2836607">But in part I think it's fair to say that the reassessment was based on the conclusion that it had been unwise as a matter of law to drop the appeal.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="682.299" offset="2879761">I was just curious if we knew, as between category one and category two, what the relative sizes of the categories were.</text>

            <text syncTime="690.984" offset="2914452">There are very, very few people who fall into category one, a handful of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.097" offset="2934932">Now, as I said, the Respondent Mendoza is a member of this group, category two in Judge Renfrew's terminology.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.115" offset="2974951">When he applied for citizenship in 1978, the Government opposed because he is not eligible for citizenship under the current law and because he had never made any attempt to apply for citizenship in 1945 and 1946 when the Sections 701 and 702 were in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.426" offset="3044228">But the district court treated this case as simply a routine application of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.379" offset="3072022">The court held that, since the Government had had an opportunity to litigate the due process issue in the 68 Filipinos case, it shouldn't be allowed to relitigate the same legal issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.828" offset="3121864">And, as I mentioned earlier, the Ninth Circuit agreed with this analysis and affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.582" offset="3140881">We believe the Court of Appeals' decision is plainly wrong on a number of different levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.126" offset="3163033">If we approach the case simply as a technical legal matter, it seems clear that the Ninth Circuit simply misapplied black-letter principles of estoppel law.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.301" offset="3203784">The Court of Appeals simply relied on this Court's decision in Parklane Hosiery, without realizing that Parklane really just talked about collateral estoppel on an issue of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.299" offset="3247774">Different considerations have always been applied to preclusion on issues of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.391" offset="3272120">The settled rule as set forth in this Court's cases, such as Moser, Montana, and as explained in the various Restatements of Judgments, is that estoppel on a pure or unmixed question of law is never appropriate unless, at a minimum, there are the same parties to the two lawsuits and the two lawsuits involve the same so-called "demand", to use the Moser and Montana terminology.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.862" offset="3386014">Now, those requirements were plainly not met here because Mendoza was not a party to the 68 Filipinos litigation and by no stretch of the language can Respondent Mendoza's demand to become a citizen be considered the same demand as the naturalization claims of the unrelated aliens in the 68 Filipinos case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1082.462" offset="4480440">Now, when the issue involved is one of fact I think we can all understand why there is no great public interest served by allowing the losing party to have a second shot at trying to explain why a particular fact situation is as he alleges it to be, rather than as the first court found it to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.283" offset="4547627">But when we're dealing with a legal issue, and particularly when we're dealing with an issue of constitutional dimensions as we are in this case, it's really hard to conclude that relitigation in cases involving other parties is needless.</text>

            <text syncTime="1184.841" offset="4889936">In fact, I think it's fair to say that this Court particularly would be ill served if it regularly had to decide legal issues without the benefit of divergent lower court opinions, which often serve to highlight or sharpen the legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.099" offset="4946987">The Court has often remarked on the value of having a legal issue mature through the lower courts before it's finally resolved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.563" offset="4976767">Now, perhaps the Ninth Circuit's rule, if applied to private parties, wouldn't be all that harmful, because most private parties don't litigate a legal issue more than once, and most private litigants don't forego an appeal when they think their legal arguments are sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.517" offset="5052626">But we think that the Ninth Circuit's rule would have a devastating effect on the conduct of institutional litigants, and particularly the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.401" offset="5088153">The Federal Government is constantly involved in litigating legal issues on a nationwide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.466" offset="5112394">In fact, many legal issues, such as the immigration issues in this case and most constitutional issues, really only can arise in Government litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.481" offset="5144473">And if the Government were compelled to abide by the first decision adverse to its position, we submit it would have a number of unfortunate results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.777" offset="5181671">For one thing, the Government would have to abandon its traditional, and we think quite salutary, policy of carefully screening the cases it takes on appeal, and particularly the cases it takes to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.544" offset="5232767">And I daresay it would impose a substantial burden on this Court if it knew that it had to grant review of the first petition drafted by the Government on a legal issue or else the lower court's decision would become forever binding on a nationwide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.955" offset="5294311">In fact, I guess to the extent the Ninth Circuit's rule requires that appeals be taken that wouldn't otherwise be taken, it really retards rather than advances one of the--</text>

            <text syncTime="1322.709" offset="5441328">There are other harmful consequences as well, I think, that flow from the Ninth Circuit's ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.624" offset="5472989">If the Government were allowed only one legal bite at any legal issue, it would tend to petrify or freeze the law quite unnaturally and often quite unfairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.853" offset="5521994">This Court pointed out in Standefer that litigation over public rights stand on a decidedly different footing than private litigation when it comes to applications of the preclusion doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.832" offset="5581867">Preclusion on a legal issue might prevent the Government from bringing or defending some lawsuit that we would all agree would be in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.949" offset="5618334">In fact, I suppose the Ninth Circuit's rule would allow one Administration to bind a future Administration on an issue of constitutional law or statutory construction, simply by not appealing some adverse decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.445" offset="5668280">It would also prevent the Government from changing policies over time in response to changes in outlook or experience, and this case is in many ways a textbook example of what I'm talking about, because the decision to drop the appeal in 68 Filipinos and then the decision to reconsider that decision and to begin... and to enforce the immigration laws in a particular way, is the sort of constant reassessment of administrative and legal positions, enforcement positions, that the Government frequently undertakes, and that we would all agree the Government should be encouraged to undertake in a democratic society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.285" offset="5847689">Now, in a sense perhaps I've been a trifle unfair in describing the Ninth Circuit's rule, because to be fair the Court of Appeals did say that there may be certain circumstances where it would not be appropriate to collaterally estop the Government on an issue of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.216" offset="5919369">The court suggested that estoppel was appropriate here because it found no "critical need" to re-examine the legal issue and no great public interest in opposing Respondent's naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.656" offset="5977152">We obviously disagree with both of these contentions on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.651" offset="5997110">But the more important point for these purposes is that the Ninth Circuit's test is totally unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.844" offset="6017903">When the Government has to make its decision whether to appeal an adverse ruling, it would be hard to predict how a court later on might decide whether there was a critical need for re-examination or whether the issue was important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.733" offset="6077462">We don't know of any instance in which district courts or Courts of Appeals are empowered to refuse to decide legal issues because they don't consider them important enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.829" offset="6117900">Now, I just want to add one more word about the Ninth Circuit's collateral estoppel ruling in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.993" offset="6142559">Even if the Court were to disagree with everything I've said up until now, we think it would still have to reverse the Court of Appeals because the Ninth Circuit has precluded the Government from litigating not only issues that were raised and decided in the 68 Filipinos case, but also a number of quite significant legal issues that were never litigated in 68 Filipinos.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.037" offset="6234719">Even as applied to an issue of fact, collateral estoppel has never been taken that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.211" offset="6259379">I think the Ninth Circuit confused collateral estoppel with res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.945" offset="6282367">We've mentioned in our brief a number of the significant legal issues that were never raised in 68 Filipinos that we would like the opportunity at the very least to raise in Respondent's case, involving laches and the effect of Section 1421(e), an important legal issue as to whether, even if a due process violation occurred, a court has the power to order citizenship as a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.692" offset="6373273">I do want to mention one specifically because I think it particularly shows the unfairness of the application of collateral estoppel in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.356" offset="6403993">Even if the Government were precluded from challenging the due process holding in the 68 Filipinos case, there would still be a substantial question as to whether this Respondent is entitled to the relief that the 68 Filipinos plaintiffs received, because the 68 Filipinos plaintiffs had all been in the Philippines during the nine-month period that the naturalization examiner was absent, whereas Respondent Mendoza was in the United States for six of those months and could easily have applied for citizenship under Section 701 simply by going into any United States district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.270" offset="6551637">So it's very hard to understand why, at the very least, the Government is estopped from litigating whether this Respondent is entitled to the substantial benefit of citizenship, when there are substantial legal and mixed questions that were never litigated in the 68 Filipinos case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1686.615" offset="6896976">My client, Dr. Mendoza, is a man who cannot understand why the Government is making it so hard for him to become an American citizen when it has already agreed to the naturalization of other Filipino veterans who fought side by side with him in places like Bataan and Corregidor and who were naturalized just as he was filing his own application under the very same law that's at issue in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.887" offset="7018079">In his opinion that's simply unfair.</text>

            <text syncTime="1720.280" offset="7031663">Well, since you raise that, doesn't he, or you to this Court, have an obligation to explain why he didn't make an application in the six months when he was in this country studying medicine?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_l_ungar" startTime="1735.139" stopTime="1800.262">
            <label>Mr. Donald L. Ungar</label>
            <text syncTime="1735.139" offset="7091118">Well, he's testified at the district court that he didn't apply because he didn't know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.312" offset="7107836">Of course, that raises a question that Mr. Geller brings up, about his presence in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.627" offset="7133018">Obviously, he was present in this country for a time during 1945 when he might have applied had he known about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.610" offset="7161021">But what Mr. Geller doesn't explain and leaves us guessing is why that should make a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.856" offset="7181919">And I say that because there was nothing in this particular wartime naturalization law which compelled a soldier or sailor to apply while he was in the United States, or that he had to apply at any particular place, or that he had to apply at any particular time during the statutory period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.648" offset="7253181">As a matter of fact, one of the major points of this law was that soldiers and sailors who were on duty overseas could apply overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.981" offset="7282439">So that if Dr. Mendoza had known about this law at the time, it would have been perfectly reasonable for him to make a decision that he would apply or decide to apply when he returned to the Philippines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.250" offset="7331549">There's a lot of considerations which go into whether someone could apply for naturalization.</text>

            <text syncTime="1810.330" offset="7391839">But on the other hand, the Government is claiming that that fact makes this case different and therefore the Government ought to be excepted from the rule of collateral estoppel under the traditional collateral estoppel doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.086" offset="7438860">What we're suggesting is that not every factual distinction warrants an exemption from that doctrine, but only material facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.751" offset="7469580">And when Dr. Mendoza was returned to the Philippines during the period of time in which the naturalization examiner was forbidden from naturalizing qualified veterans there, his circumstances, his situation, became identical to that of the veterans involved in the 68 veterans case, and he suffered the very same injury that Judge Renfrew found to exist in the 68 veterans case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.107" offset="7558919">In any event, I bring up the matter of the inequity in this situation not merely to remind the Court that an inequity like that exists.</text>

            <text syncTime="2043.512" offset="8324620">I say that for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.244" offset="8335487">First of all, 68 veterans was the first case to raise the due process issue, and it was the first case to reach a Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.090" offset="8370909">And it involved 68 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.471" offset="8380417">It wasn't just one veteran coming along and applying for naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.854" offset="8394001">There were 68 people who were involved in that particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2548.041" offset="10342736">So if there are only a couple hundred people who have applied, the numbers who are going to apply ultimately can't be very large.</text>

            <text syncTime="2584.396" offset="10488081">I think obviously the stare decisis would be the ordinary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.898" offset="10506158">It's not an absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.470" offset="10512427">I don't believe the Restatement talks of stare decisis as an absolute when applied to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.682" offset="10533221">But I think when the Government has changed its position and wants to come back into court, the least it could do would be to come forward with evidence or a showing that there really is some significant recurring national issue that makes the Government different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.493" offset="10608558">And after all, that really is why the Government should be treated differently than private litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.827" offset="10625799">It's supposed to represent the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.348" offset="10635934">If that's so, then at least it should come to court and say, look, there really is a public interest here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.451" offset="10656310">I can't see how they've done that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.035" offset="10666654">They come in and they talk about how this decision would impinge upon the President's powers and how it would impinge upon the power of Congress to provide a uniform rule of naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.120" offset="10715033">But it should be obvious that Judge Renfrew's decision in this case is going to be limited by the extraordinary facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.487" offset="10744499">It' a really extraordinary set of circumstances, because this circumstance is simply not going to happen again, realistically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.410" offset="10776159">The Government is talking about a recurring national... a recurring issue of national significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.276" offset="10803640">How can that be when the facts are not going to recur?</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.618" offset="10817015">It seems to me that in any future litigation Judge Renfrew's decision can easily be distinguished on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.123" offset="10843033">I think the same is true about the Government's argument that somehow Judge Renfrew's decision stands for the proposition that courts may impinge upon the Congressional power to provide a rule of naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.151" offset="10891098">That's not what Judge Renfrew's decision really stands for, and of course it really amazes me that the Government would come in here with that sort of argument when it thwarted the will of Congress itself back in 1945 when it refused to let these people be naturalized who should have been naturalized under that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.341" offset="10963928">But Judge Renfrew's decision in any event doesn't stand for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.366" offset="10983990">All it stands for is the proposition that when a person has been denied an opportunity to apply for naturalization under a law that Congress provided for that person's benefit and that denial amounts to a denial of due process, then no statute can stand as a bar to his naturalization anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.267" offset="11051594">So it seems to me the Government has failed totally in coming before this Court and establishing that there really is an issue that would be of recurring national significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.043" offset="11094749">And it seems to me that if the Government is to be treated as different from private litigants, it has to be treated that way because of the public interest that it represents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.528" offset="11128603">If it can't come forward with a real public interest argument, then why not apply collateral estoppel to the Government?</text>

            <text syncTime="2933.992" offset="11886468">Well, I think that that argument is as exaggerated as the argument the Government has made about the numbers of people who would apply when they were arguing the Hibi case and when they were arguing 68 veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.743" offset="11941534">It's difficult for me to belief that if Dr. Mendoza is naturalized as an American citizen, somehow the Solicitor General of the United States is going to be unable to recognize what cases to appeal and what cases not to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.440" offset="11996287">In fact, the considerations that he says himself he takes into account in deciding whether to appeal or not would be similar to those issues he would have to take into account in deciding whether there's a danger of estoppel if an appeal is not taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.222" offset="12059399">For example, the significance of the issues, the foreseeability of future litigation, whether the stakes in the two cases were virtually the same, or whether there's some overriding public interest involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.439" offset="12104329">Those are the same considerations, of course, that this Court held in Parklane were the kinds of considerations that the trial court should take into account in the application of offensive collateral estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.636" offset="12157096">In response to what Justice O'Connor requested, it seems to me it's difficult also to think of situations where the Government is going to be estopped very often, as a matter of fact, because they will have the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.336" offset="12211849">My point is simply that they have not established a public interest in the circumstances of this particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3107.595" offset="12580907">I hope I'll say that when I'm 75, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.969" offset="12598461">I think I'd like to turn for a moment to the argument that Mr. Geller made with respect to the Moser exception that's discussed in the Montana case in this matter of not only identity of parties, but the applicability of that Moser exception to unmixed questions of law that are based upon a different demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.600" offset="12720923">In my opinion, Moser... that Moser exception really ought to be interpreted, as I think the Court interpreted it in Montana, in light of the purpose and objectives of that particular exception or that particular rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.780" offset="12785707">And it seems to me the purpose and objective of that particular rule was simply that a rule of law should not be applied to facts and circumstances that are different, significantly different from facts and circumstances that led to adoption of the rule in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.590" offset="12852894">If that were the case, then constitutional doctrine would be frozen, development of the law would be hindered, because the law couldn't adapt to changing times and changing circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.569" offset="12900855">But in my opinion there's no danger of freezing the law in this particular case when the facts are identical, and if the facts are identical or substantially identical in time and subject matter there really isn't this danger that the Court was talking about in Moser and Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.130" offset="12967101">Certainly that's no danger in the circumstances of this case, when the factual... the historical facts that gave rise to the rule of law by Judge Renfrew in his opinion, those historical facts are really identical, and there's no danger that the Court was concerned about in Moser and Montana of freezing constitutional doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.244" offset="13051529">That's all I meant when I said in our brief that this term "different demand" that's used in Moser doesn't mean that a demand is different simply because another litigant comes along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.884" offset="13110043">It seems to me if that were the case then the Moser exception is never going to apply, because there's always going to be a different party coming along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.617" offset="13140972">It seems to me a demand is different when the historical facts of the second case are substantially different, are substantially unrelated from the facts of the first case, because if they are that would thwart the purpose or objective of the rule in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.397" offset="13200114">But when they're not substantially unrelated, then it seems to me that objective is satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.784" offset="13229684">I think as long as I have a moment or two left, I would like to mention just one or two other points with respect to the Hibi case on the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.077" offset="13322889">It seems to me what we're talking about here is issue preclusion, and the due process issue that was raised in 68 veterans and in Dr. Mendoza's case was not an issue that was addressed by the Court in Hibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.796" offset="13377746">Obviously, the facts were pretty much the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.499" offset="13392584">But the fact that the facts were the same doesn't mean that the issue was the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.502" offset="13412541">The only issue that was addressed by the Court was the equitable estoppel issue and not the due process issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.307" offset="13443784">And I think it's interesting to note what this Court said about Hibi in the Miranda case, which is cited in the Government's brief, INS versus Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.303" offset="13483803">In INS versus Miranda, this Court recognized that what the Government did here was an error, a clear error, in failing to allow the naturalization examiner to carry out his duty in the Philippines in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.363" offset="13535944">Obviously, the Court didn't feel that that error rose to the level of affirmative misconduct which would trigger the application of equitable estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.938" offset="13570321">But this concept of affirmative misconduct really has nothing to do with the issue of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.652" offset="13593100">Since equitable estoppel was the only issue that was addressed and adjudicated by this Court in Hibi, it seems to me Hibi does not have any preclusive effect on the case here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3441.173" offset="13915242">The unfairness issue comes in only on the collateral estoppel question, which is the specific issue in the Mendoza case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.098" offset="13950977">One last point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.430" offset="13956306">Mr. Geller makes a point of saying that there were certain issues that were not addressed in 68 veterans which were addressed in the Mendoza case, and he refers to laches and the effect of Section 1421(e) of Title 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.048" offset="14010745">Well, I've re-examined the record in 68 veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.341" offset="14023911">It may be true that laches was not argued at the district court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.045" offset="14042719">There's nothing in the papers that I've looked at which suggests that it was argued, although it may have been at oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.469" offset="14064453">In any event, laches was not argued by the Government in the Mendoza case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.951" offset="14082321">So it seems to me it's kind of ironic for the Government to make that argument when it didn't raise laches in the Mendoza case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.196" offset="14111369">And you can look at the record yourself on that point, which is set forth in the Government's petition for certiorari in the Litonjua case which is now pending before the Court on a petition for certiorari, where the Government points out that in the recommendation of the immigration examiner to the district court there's no mention of laches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.891" offset="14202066">As for Section 1421(e), of course, that was what this case was all about, and the question was whether 1421(e) barred the 68 veterans from being naturalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.247" offset="14247519">And that certainly was raised in 68 veterans, as it was raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.421" offset="14264238">And evidence of that fact, of course, is in the Government's brief to the Ninth Circuit in 68 veterans, where they raise this issue of 1421(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.328" offset="14303839">Obviously, they wouldn't be raising that issue on appeal for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.528" offset="14316692">They would have had to raise in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.891" offset="14326096">And as I said, that's the whole argument on the merits, is whether or not 1421(e) ought to bar the veterans from being naturalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.276" offset="14363608">Thank you very much.</text>
