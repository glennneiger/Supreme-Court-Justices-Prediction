            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="152727">We will hear arguments first this morning in McDonough Power Equipment Company against Greenwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.087" offset="193060">Mr. Patterson, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald R. Patterson</label>
            <text syncTime="14.770" offset="211764">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.004" offset="228691">This is an appeal from a mandate of the Tenth Circuit which ordered a new trial in a product liability personal injury suit in which the verdict and the resultant judgment were for the Defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.381" offset="274249">At the trial level fault was allocated to non-parties under a procedure that is governed by Kansas law and fashioned under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure where there already was quite a tight merger between Federal Rules of Procedures and the substantive law of Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.905" offset="352303">A special verdict was returned in order to accommodate that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.317" offset="369961">There was a finding in which damages were also found under the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.620" offset="387202">The ground for a new trial was what the Tenth Circuit described.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.182" offset="405383">It was an impairment to the use of a peremptory challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.346" offset="422102">In order to focus upon the precise issue, I believe it can best be accomplished by describing very briefly what the case is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.252" offset="465674">It is not a case of juror misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.065" offset="480929">The Tenth Circuit found the juror, in responding to the voir dire questions, was honest and in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.919" offset="508306">It is not a question of juror qualification or the lack of the statutory qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.283" offset="533801">There was not a denial of a hearing to determine whether or not actual bias existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.099" offset="561073">No hearing was granted, no hearing was requested after the court permitted an interview with the juror by both counsel simultaneously over the telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.975" offset="600570">Subsequent to that interview, there was no hearing requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.988" offset="620632">There was no trial error that was identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.890" offset="640276">We have the unusual situation, as was described in the brief, of a wrong without a wrong-doer.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.726" offset="675594">It was not a case of denial of a peremptory challenge itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.851" offset="700045">Each side was given three.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.653" offset="707254">It was a two-party case.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.524" offset="714778">The contention and the ruling of the Circuit was that a peremptory challenge was impaired due to the lack of a level of information which counsel had at the time the peremptory challenge had to be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.795" offset="791891">In order to focus upon that, I think it is necessary to subdivide and identify three more separate issues which are really the substance of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.723" offset="835568">The first is what I have denominated the right-to-know argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.376" offset="854167">Is there or should there be a level of information to which counsel are entitled that is over and above that which is provided by good faith, honest answers to proper voir dire questions?</text>
            <text syncTime="190.375" offset="914144">The Tenth Circuit held that there was that level of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.208" offset="933475">It was described by the Tenth Circuit as that level of information that would be provided by the "average" juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.515" offset="974748">That is the only description we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.837" offset="984048">That is the only description of the standard that we must meet.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="210.809" offset="995960">You are saying then, Mr. Patterson, that the Tenth Circuit went beyond requiring the juror to in good faith answer the question as he understood it?</text>

            <text syncTime="241.820" offset="1119989">Rule 47, of course, gives the court leeway either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.090" offset="1133050">The court can ask all questions on voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.033" offset="1144858">He can permit counsel to ask questions on voir dire or there can be a combination of both.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.566" offset="1162934">In this case both was done.</text>
