            <label>Mr. M. Laurence Popofsky</label>
            <text syncTime="62.673" offset="393270">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="65.375" offset="404032">We are here because we believe that the Ninth Circuit fundamentally misconceived the background, history and purposes of the statute enacted in 1980, and as a consequence also misconceived the congressional solution to the problem of the northwest region.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.522" offset="492640">I would like to dwell just a brief moment on the history because I think it is instructive of how the preference problem fits into the congressional solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.330" offset="535899">Under the Bonneville Project Act of 1937 Bonneville was authorized to serve all classes of customers with power.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.221" offset="583441">Those classes of customers included not only those who were accorded statutory preference and priority but also utilities, which were privately owned and which had no such a priority, federal agencies and my clients, the DSI's, the Direct Service Industries, which are principally aluminum companies operating in the northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.572" offset="696813">Now the service to the aluminum companies, to the DSI's has certain characteristics which are important as we move into the congressional considerations in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.862" offset="741952">Among those considerations are that the load is interruptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.750" offset="761597">Unlike most industries or indeed most utilities it is possible without absolute and complete harm to operations to stop electricity, at least for short times, on an immediate basis in order to protect service to other customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.010" offset="826589">At the same time because of the character of the DSI load it is also possible to serve that load with what is called nonfirm energy, essentially energy, the production of which cannot be guaranteed based on historic water conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.554" offset="892731">As a consequence, over the years the DSI load was conceived by Bonneville has having unique values to the northwest in the form of providing reserves to protect firm power loads by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.331" offset="955843">There was only one problem with the system as it existed in the thirties, forties and fifties, and that is that water was finite.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.087" offset="986877">Dams were built on all acceptable locations, environmentally acceptable locations, and by the early 1970's all the best estimates were that the finite amount of power being generated by Bonneville would run out.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.096" offset="1050929">That is where the preference clause of the 1937 statute was triggered.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.202" offset="1075379">First, went the private utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.154" offset="1091157">Their contracts expired in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.689" offset="1101293">All service to them was terminated by Bonneville except for spot purchases thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.724" offset="1121459">In 1975 and 1976 the DSI's were advised that their contracts which had been in existence since the early sixties would when they expired most likely not be renewed, again because of the existence of the preference clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.203" offset="1191363">The consequence was and the picture which emerged was that the only power that would be available would go to preference customers, preference utilities alone, and that that would be inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.927" offset="1238279">But the anomoly was that the Bonneville Project Act of 1937 was intended to serve consumers and farmers in the region and yet only a portion of the region was served by the preference utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.087" offset="1298883">The fact I believe you will see in the record that Oregon was generally not served by preference utilities whereas Washington was largely served by preference utilities and the disparity in rates that emerged in the seventies caused, needless to say, a considerable political problem in the northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.766" offset="1381639">What happened in sum was that preference emerged as the problem, not an adequate solution to the problems of the northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.010" offset="1430540">The only solution that was possible was congressional, and that is why the statute was enacted in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.330" offset="1455827">Now the statute ended what was called a regional civil war, and it ended it in a manner which we think is straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.584" offset="1488846">It decreed as its first element of legislation that the power which was to be available would be legislatively allocated, not allocated administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.093" offset="1546942">Priority and preference, the old preference clause after all, was a congressional direction to the administrator giving him instructions as to how he, the administrator, should allocate power.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.753" offset="1597515">That is what the preference clause does.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.119" offset="1607023">It governs administrative allocations.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.555" offset="1616741">The heart of a statute in 1980 was to take the allocation function away from the administrator and legislate it directly by statute.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="382.215" offset="1671389">Mr. Popofsky, do we find this heart of the statute in any one section or subsection?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="m_laurence_popofsky" startTime="388.118" stopTime="493.369">
            <label>Mr. M. Laurence Popofsky</label>
            <text syncTime="388.118" offset="1695004">We do not find it in any one section of the 85 pages of legislation, but I believe you will find it mostly in section 5 where the sales to classes of customers are mandated, and that is the key, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.080" offset="1762818">You will see in section 5 that the administrator is mandated directly by Congress to enter into contracts, the terms of which are specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.202" offset="1807330">Now historically the preference clause has always honored the existence of contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.892" offset="1842126">Contracts could be performed in accordance with their terms without an invasion by a preference customer so long as they had been validly entered into in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.199" offset="1887370">What Congress was doing in mandating contracts for all four classes of customers, for the preference customers, the privates, for the federals and directly for the DSI's, what Congress was doing was saying, we mandate directly by statute this amount of power... we will come to that, of course... this amount of power for these classes of customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.548" offset="1980783">Now we know that we are mandating more power than Bonneville has.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.517" offset="1996666">We know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.952" offset="2002308">The answer to that is we will also authorize Bonneville for the first time to acquire the resources necessary to serve these contracts, and then we will do one more remarkable thing so there can be no doubt and no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.311" offset="2067823">In 5(g)(7) we will create a fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.865" offset="2082034">We will write a fiction right into the statute which says the administrator shall be deemed to have sufficient power to enter into these contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="493.369" offset="2115993">Mr. Popofsky, I have the same question really I guess that Justice Rehnquist has already asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.773" offset="2137623">Section 5 starts out by saying all power sales under this Act shall be subject at all times to the preference and priority provision of the prior statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="536.095" offset="2286939">I was also referring to the appendix to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.047" offset="2298746">But in (5)(g)(1) there is a mandate that the administrator shall commence negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.883" offset="2330093">In (5)(d)(1)(b), the crucial provision, after the effective date of this Act, the administrator shall offer... it is mandatory language... in accordance with subsection (g) of this section to each existing DSI contract, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.534" offset="2432702">Indeed if you look at the legislative hearings, the committee reports they are described throughout as required, mandated contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.040" offset="2470736">I believe it is because of the character that they are mandated directly by Congress that section (5)(a) of the statute can be read to subsist with them in accordance with its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.816" offset="2529773">(5)(a) applies to all power, all power which is not subject to a valid and lawful contract, and a valid, lawful initial contract are those specified as mandated by the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="615.409" offset="2604170">Perhaps it should maybe by implication, but it says all power sales under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.963" offset="2626426">It does not make any exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="624.198" offset="2639383">It absolutely says that, and the only question, therefore, before the Court is how does one reconcile a mandate by Congress, a congressional allocation, if you will, of power with the flat statement in (5)(a) that all sales are subject to preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.959" offset="2702390">The answer to that, Your Honor, is plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.661" offset="2713152">Preference has never, has never required the invasion or invalidation of a lawful, valid contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.701" offset="2749306">For example, in the 1970's the clients that I represent, the DSI's, had lawful contracts which were going to expire in 1981 to 1991.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.723" offset="2793401">There was not adequate power by 1976, and yet nobody suggested that because if there was now an insufficiency of power that those contracts were in any way invadable.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.097" offset="2838958">They were valid according to their terms notwithstanding the coexistence of a preference right.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.518" offset="2864663">Preference attaches only at the time of the offer of a new contract to competing applicants, and here Congress preempted the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.261" offset="2915549">They said, we will take the applications ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.813" offset="2929760">Through the legislative process all four classes will be served.</text>

            <text syncTime="702.117" offset="2950971">Would you go back a minute and spell out a little more what you mean by preference attaches only at the time the contract is offered?</text>

            <label>Mr. M. Laurence Popofsky</label>
            <text syncTime="708.771" offset="2977616">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.404" offset="2980124">Under the preference clauses of various statutes as they have been interpreted throughout the federal courts, preference attaches as a directive to the administrator under a statute who is marketing federal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.630" offset="3045117">It attaches at the time when the administrator has power for sale and announces that and there are competing applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.702" offset="3081375">If among the competing applicants, for example, a preference utility on the one hand and a DSI on the other, both applied and there was not enough power to serve both, at that point preference would govern and direct the administrator to serve the preference agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.814" offset="3145845">If there was sufficient power for both, on the other hand, he would serve both.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.266" offset="3163608">If, on the other hand, he had actually entered into that contract, goes ahead and enters into that contract, and five years later on... assume it is a 20 year contract... five years later on a preference utility comes along and says, hey, I would like some of that power, and I have a statutory preference, no court has ever held he has a right to invade an existing contract, lawful under the preference clause when entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.416" offset="3264232">It is for that very reason you will find in the statute a requirement that in the contracts for the private utilities there is a five-year pull back clause to protect the preference notion that after five years if power has become insufficient for any reason those contracts can be interrupted by direction of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.247" offset="3351585">That is the historic functioning of the preference clause and why section (5)(a) can coexist in a cohesive and integrated legislative scheme with the mandated contracts of our clients.</text>

            <text syncTime="837.587" offset="3492855">The government's argument boils down to two points I would like to stress this morning: first, that the Bonneville administrator's decision fully accords with expressed statutory directive and with congressional intent, and that alone should suffice to reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.548" offset="3564744">Our second point is that even if other interpretations of the Act are possible that the administrator's decision is a reasonable one and is, therefore, entitled to substantial deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.689" offset="3613332">I am not going to spend much time putting the Regional Act in perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.860" offset="3634021">I think Mr. Popofsky has done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.795" offset="3641753">I would like to emphasize only that at the time that the Act was under consideration the region faced three pressing concerns: an impending power shortage, uncertainty in planning for the future, and a great disparity in rates paid by consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.322" offset="3711866">What was needed and what was recognized as the solution to this was a legislative plan of allocation, and for this the region turned to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.314" offset="3763797">The Act that Congress passed was a careful balance of interdependent factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.301" offset="3791801">In the end the competing interests that addressed Congress arrived at a compromise, and in this compromise all customers derived benefits and all were required to make concessions in order that the common good in planning for power could be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.583" offset="3880930">Now in this proceeding the Respondents are seeking to upset that balance, and they are trying to do that by preserving the enormous benefits they got in the Regional Act while rejecting the trade-offs that they had to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.426" offset="3940281">Obviously the statute and its subject matter are highly technical and complex, but the legal issues in the case are straightforward and relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.234" offset="3987510">In our view they are easily believed under well established rules of statutory construction and administrative law.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.738" offset="4017499">The key to the case is the expressed directive of section (5)(d)(1)(B) in the Regional Act that Bonneville shall offer to each existing DSI an initial long-term contract that provides for an amount of power equivalent to that which such customers are entitled under its 1975 contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1128.856" offset="4658021">The '75 contracts indicated in section 4... that is at page N-2 of the appendix to the petition... that the amount of power that is sold is the full amount, the full contract load.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.032" offset="4706713">Those were the figures that were before Congress when it was considering the Regional Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.917" offset="4726253">Now I might also add that the questions as to interruption do not appear in section 4 of the 1975 contracts, but rather they are elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.244" offset="4783513">The amount of power is clearly the full amount and was clearly understood by everyone to be the full contract load.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.216" offset="4815383">On this question of the amount of power, in our view what we were required to do was to offer a contract that provided an amount of power equivalent to the amount they were entitled to in 1975, and as you can see from the chart on page 20 of the joint appendix we have done precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.715" offset="4909423">We offered new contracts for the same amount of power that the DSI's were entitled to before, and in our view there is really nothing else that need be addressed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.273" offset="4955608">Since the 1981 contracts entitle the DSI's to no greater amount of power Bonneville clearly followed an express and specific statutory command.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.479" offset="4996463">Unfortunately the Ninth Circuit in its initial opinion did not even address this issue, amount of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.318" offset="5031781">In footnote 9 of its original opinion, which is at page 65 of the joint appendix, it specifically declined to decide whether the new contracts involved a greater amount of power than the old ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.392" offset="5080160">It was wrong for the court to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.577" offset="5088832">The issue had to be addressed, and eventually when the court did address it in its amended opinion it added footnote 4 that says, in effect, the '75 contracts never entitled the DSI's to the top quartile and, therefore, the new contracts can do no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.937" offset="5154243">The point is that that is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.139" offset="5163125">As I indicated, section 4 of the '75 contracts specified an amount of power, and it was the full amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.311" offset="5199801">Now because the top quartile was subject to interruption which is something that happens under a different section of those contracts, the court concluded that the DSI's are now entitled to... are limited to the same terms of service as they were before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.189" offset="5263330">What it did was it confused the notion of amount of power and terms of service, and I would like to point out why that is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.760" offset="5293632">First of all, the Regional Act is to the contrary, and the House Commerce report makes clear at page D-123 of the appendix to the petition that section 5(d)(1) refers to the amount of power to which the DSI's were entitled and not to the amount that happened to be used at a particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.673" offset="5377224">In addition, there were tables that were listing what the DSI entitlement was and what Congress understood it to be, and those figures in the House and the Senate reports are references to the full contract load under the 1975 contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.135" offset="5455069">What the Ninth Circuit also ignored was the clear congressional directive that Bonneville take new steps to improve the quality of service to the top quartile and to serve that quartile as if it were firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.995" offset="5518495">Now that language F-74 of the appendix to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.266" offset="5551618">While the Ninth Circuit acknowledged that this was the congressional plan and said so in footnote 7 of its opinion it did not understand the significance of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.491" offset="5600519">Instead it dismissed the committee reports as ambiguous and meaningless, but the Court of Appeals really made no effort to understand what those reports were about, and in particular the court made no reference to section 5(f) of the Act, another provision dealing with the question of when the preference customers are entitled to assert that preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.445" offset="5724339">Now even if the question of the quality of service is reached it is our position that the Respondents are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.885" offset="5762060">Unlike the situation that existed before when the DSI's top quartile could be interrupted for any reason, the Regional Act specifies that the DSI load shall provide a portion of the administrator's reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.311" offset="5823814">That is, it may be interrupted only for firm power loads within the region.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.333" offset="5851921">That is in section 5(d)(1)(A) of the Act, and it is language that is consistent with section 5(b)(1) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.856" offset="5885985">Now the import of that language is made crystal clear in the Senate report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.991" offset="5906465">That is at page F-47 and F-48 of the appendix to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.478" offset="5928408">That report states that it is not intended that the administrator's reserves will be used to protect other than firm loads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.234" offset="5963517">So it was Congress that changed the status of the DSI reserve and the terms of interruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.924" offset="5994237">It was not an arbitrary or capricious act of the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.709" offset="6009388">Let there be no mistake about it, Congress was absolutely well aware of what it was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.379" offset="6032062">While this complex legislation was pending, Representative Kazen the Chairman of the House Interior Subcommittee on Water and Power inquired of Bonneville just how the DSI load would be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.372" offset="6088068">The administrator responded and told Representative Kazen that he would do precisely what he eventually did, namely, that 25 percent would be subject to restriction to serve firm loads of other customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.799" offset="6145747">This statement was adopted verbatim in the House report and approved by the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.619" offset="6173019">The Act was passed with this understanding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1801.359" offset="7348006">The simple answer to that is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.842" offset="7357933">Let me look at the problem that Congress faced, too much demand in the northwest, not enough supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.981" offset="7390429">The solution was not, as Petitioners would suggest, take something from my clients and give it to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.571" offset="7420836">The solution as Senator Henry Jackson, the sponsor of the bill, said was simply to bake a bigger pie and for the first time give Bonneville the authority to acquire resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.979" offset="7474439">In fact, I believe the statement is, the Act will give Bonneville the authority to buy power to serve nonpreference customers without offending the principles of preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.638" offset="7529087">That is what is unique about this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.106" offset="7539014">That is why it passed after four years of discussion with the regional consensus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.875" offset="7558031">Now the answer to the question posed, did Congress change this, is the simple and straightfoward language of the Act, two provisions, one of which Justice Stevens has already referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.068" offset="7614769">Congress said in straight language all power sales shall be subject to this priority, and later at section 10(c), nothing shall abridge, diminish, affect, or change in any way whatsoever this priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.513" offset="7684568">What Congress did is bake a bigger pie, as Senator Jackson used that analogy in introducing the bill, drew a line down the middle of it and said, this side is the priority customers... that is why they are supporting this... and this side over here, we are now going to give Bonneville the authority to buy resources, and that will serve the needs of the nonpreference customers and provide rate relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2699.921" offset="10942246">There was no problem with that because Bonneville also had short-term purchase authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.158" offset="10967219">This was a provision that the aluminum companies authored that some outsider could not come in and say, Bonneville, you cannot enter into 20-year contracts because you have not acquired the resources yet.</text>

            <text syncTime="2828.104" offset="11454978">One other important point, I think, is that the Solicitor discussed the reserves provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.310" offset="11487788">The reserves that are provided in the Regional Act are a codification of BPA's administrative practice prior to the Regional Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.481" offset="11524463">That was told to Congress, and that is what Congress did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.783" offset="11537629">It codified it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.567" offset="11540764">Prior to the Regional Act, and this is quoted in our brief, Mr. Goldhammer who authorized these reserve provisions described them as providing reserves to the administrator for his firm loads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.527" offset="11592695">The court in the Ninth Circuit in Port of Astoria v. Hodel, the only court to construe these reserves, said they provide reserves for the firm loads of the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.268" offset="11639611">Then the Role FIS, which Bonneville published simultaneously with the Act describing this alternative as how it would sell power, is almost verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.142" offset="11687154">It will provide reserves for the firm loads of the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.677" offset="11701260">The argument on the other side is that the Regional Act changed these reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.998" offset="11722576">They are almost word for word the administrative practice and everyone in the region's understanding including Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.402" offset="11748176">When they were translated into the contracts for the aluminum companies they say provide reserves for the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.806" offset="11777747">Then they get to the heart of the issue, and they say, however, power will be sold first to the aluminum companies before anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.714" offset="11821423">That is the change that they did not follow from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.066" offset="11834798">That is the change in priority that is embodied in section 8(a) of the new contract and is the heart, again, of this dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.171" offset="11867190">I would also like to emphasize a point I made earlier regarding its importance to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.658" offset="11897179">This power... again the ratio is perhaps 30 to 100, but this nonfirm power we use first of all when our reservoirs are depleted, when we are not sure we can serve our firm loads because it has not rained on our side of the mountains; secondly, when we have scheduled maintenance;... we schedule our maintenance of our plant when we can have available BPA nonfirm service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.928" offset="12010237">That will be dramatically changed under this situation... thirdly, when we have a forced outage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.248" offset="12035523">When a plant goes down our needs are small enough that if you do not put that 1,000 unit load ahead of us we can almost rely upon their being small amounts, even in a drought year, of BPA nonfirm that can protect our firm load when we need it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.126" offset="12107099">In conclusion, and I would like to summarize it really based on the framework that this Court has used in reviewing statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.236" offset="12163523">The Act itself is clear under our point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.623" offset="12185048">We have priority to all power sales and nothing shall diminish that priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.543" offset="12212738">Their reading is inconsistent with the plain language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.264" offset="12231650">They say we have priority to all sales except this nonfirm and that nothing has been diminished except this nonfirm in the northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.870" offset="12274073">As far as the legislative history, the legislative history is clear equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.059" offset="12302808">It says that priority will be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.678" offset="12313257">There will be a line drawn down this bigger pie, and we retain our priority to federal base system resources, which produce this nonfirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.450" offset="12348366">The new resources acquired by BPA or bought by BPA will go to the nonpreference customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.270" offset="12375637">That is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.306" offset="12383788">Their argument is that that legislative history is not clear and that Senator Jackson did not mean what he said or did not know what he was saying when he inserted section 5(a) into the Regional Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.114" offset="12431017">The third point is the underlying policies of the Act, and that is where they are especially inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.018" offset="12454632">If I might call it the beauty of this Act is you had a serious dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.422" offset="12480232">You had what they described as a civil war.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.124" offset="12490994">What happened is Congress said, okay, we obtained the consensus of the priority customers by protecting their priority, but BPA has not been able to acquire any new power for a long time because no dams have been built so we will give them this new authority to buy power; and, therefore, BPA can go out and acquire resources and be sure that the aluminum companies may receive their 20-year long-term supply and be sure that there can be some rate relief for the privately owned utilities in the region.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.611" offset="12624950">That in the Ninth Circuit's opinion harmonizes the Act well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.415" offset="12644176">I think to me it is inconceivable that a change of this magnitude was not asked for before Congress by the aluminum companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.008" offset="12702586">Congress in no place ever discussed it, described it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.310" offset="12719827">It is not mentioned any place in the legislative history that there is going to be a change in priority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3207.986" offset="12974468">I am not obviously going to comment on how they write an opinion, but, yes, it should have been in a footnote because the opinion says that the priority is clear and that, therefore, we do not have to go beyond the priority to the equivalent amount of power.</text>

            <label>Mr. M. Laurence Popofsky</label>
            <text syncTime="3303.614" offset="13357006">Let me start with the observation that the statute nowhere uses the concept of firm power and nowhere uses the concept nonfirm power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.553" offset="13392741">The assumption that somehow everything Congress was doing took those separate concepts into mind as a statutory matter, preference for one but not for the other, is, I think, a figment of the other side's imagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.694" offset="13445299">What Congress mandated was contracts for an amount of power, 5(b)(1)(B), for our clients, that is, a concept of load capacity, not load usage, but load capacity, and it was the same amount of load capacity as existed in the then extent DSI contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.659" offset="13537146">Now, Congress intended as BPA told them it would that it would use nonfirm power in the load subject to interruption or protection of firm resources only in load in order to serve the purposes Congress intended by guaranteeing this mandated contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.906" offset="13626171">Those purposes were, one, to provide rate relief principally for people in Oregon who were being served by the private utilities rate relief which the DSI's would have to pay for, and that is why that power getting to the DSI's was important, and also provide through the raising of rates from wholesale to retail essentially more profit downstream for Bonneville.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.521" offset="13724601">Now this was all integrated into the comprehensive legislative scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.175" offset="13747275">Congress intended specifically that a higher level of actual service be received by the DSI's through the combination of (1) a direction to Bonneville of a demand capacity; and (2) a limitation in 5(d)(1)(A) on the circumstances under which that power could be interrupted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.242" offset="13847481">You can find nowhere in the legislative history, if I may return the compliment, any discussion, any discussion whatsoever that by reaffirmation of preference somehow nonfirm power has been kept outside of the DSI load where Bonneville wanted to put it in order to obtain the operational efficiencies and the monetary goals of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.256" offset="13935566">You cannot find that anywhere in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.691" offset="13949358">All you can find is a treaty in which all customers are going to be served by mandate of Congress free and clear, at least for the original mandated contracts, of the old preference problems and a reaffirmation of preference for the future, preference in its traditional meaning, preference which honors lawful contracts, but preference which governs everything including my client's rights to any future contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.358" offset="14055938">That makes sense of the statute, and that is precisely what Bonneville did in the contracts under challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.929" offset="14078299">Thank you.</text>
