            <text syncTime="77.933" offset="455705">The issue in this case is whether the doctrine of judicial immunity bars the award of attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 1988 against a member of the judiciary acting in his judicial capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.812" offset="531251">The facts of this case arose in 1980 in Culpeper County, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.317" offset="557269">The Petitioner is a magistrate for that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.035" offset="572107">The Respondents were arrested in Culpeper on misdemeanor charges for which no incarceration was authorized by statute upon conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.891" offset="615574">When the Respondents were unable to post bond after arrest, they were ordered by a petitioner to be held in jail pending trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.997" offset="647966">Respondents thereafter challenged their pretrial detention by filing in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, a Section 1983 action against the Petitioner seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.025" offset="716094">The District Court declared the Virginia statues to be unconstitutional as applied, granted injunctive relief, and ordered the petitioner to pay attorneys' fees to the Respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.202" offset="772727">The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed that decision and held that members of the judiciary are not immune from suit, are not immune from payment of attorneys' fees in cases involving equitable or prospective relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.747" offset="842944">In this case, we are seeking and asking this Court to hold that awards of attorneys' fees against judges are not authorized because, one, judicial immunity bars such an award, and two--</text>

            <text syncTime="895.444" offset="3725713">In damage cases against judges, this Court has said repeatedly that the doctrine of judicial immunity is essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.152" offset="3768554">It is required for the vitality of the judiciary, and it is essential and necessary in order to promote fearless, principled decisionmaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.758" offset="3803036">And yet the purpose of immunity is not served by protecting judges from damage actions and exposing them to attorneys' fees and awards in prospective relief cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.649" offset="3858520">The financial impact of attorneys' fees in today's litigation can be just as chilling, just as intimidating as those that may be included in an award for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.639" offset="3906481">Now, the issue before this Court is critical because if the Court sanctions the award of attorneys' fees in this case, it will have implicitly limited the doctrine of judicial immunity and approved the suing of judges in prospective relief cases and subjecting them to the payment of attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.005" offset="3996028">And the impact of such a step would be staggering.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.457" offset="4009821">For example, this Court has said in dealing with damage cases that judges should not be subjected to the distraction, to the diversion from work in order to prepare for trial, to attend depositions, to answer interrogatories and to otherwise assist in the preparation of a defense, but those same types of distractions and diversions are available and would be required in equitable relief cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.374" offset="4121416">Equitable relief cases can have the same chilling effect on judges as damage actions because sanctions inherent in the injunctive relief process also include fines and imprisonment which are just as intimidating and pernicious as money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.986" offset="4195917">At the very heart of the judicial immunity doctrine is the concern that there be no chilling effect on independent judicial decisionmaking caused by the threat of lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.161" offset="4248580">But the chill arises regardless of the type of relief sought in a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.065" offset="4268224">The chill occurs not simply because a judge may be subject to some pecuniary loss, but because the threat of a lawsuit is intimidating, and that is not in the interest of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.909" offset="4327574">In short, what you have is the possibility that a judge would pull his punches instead of exercising the independence of judgment required by one's public responsibilities, and that is the threat to the integrity of the judicial system, regardless of whether the suit is one for damages or whether it is seeking injunctive or declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.172" offset="4420675">And if this court sanctions injunctive relief and declaratory suits against judges, the courts of this country will be flooded with a new wave of litigation brought against judicial officers all across this country, and it should not be overlooked that those cases would be aimed at federal judges as well as state jurists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.890" offset="4515552">The impact upon the calendars of the courts of this country and the quality of justice would simply be staggering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.710" offset="4542823">And the Court should not allow those types of awards of attorneys fees against judicial officers because of the impact it would have not only on the operation of justice in this country, but upon the doctrine of judicial immunity itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.153" offset="4604577">Now, may it please the Court, there is another compelling reason why judges should not be liable for attorneys' fees and subject to equitable relief cases, and that is this: Congress simply has not authorized it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.896" offset="4667584">The court below, the Fourth Circuit, declared that when the 1976 Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Award Act was passed, Congress had intended to repeal the common law doctrine of judicial immunity and to require judges to pay attorneys' fees to prevailing parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.409" offset="4745638">But the court below was wrong because the legislative history of that act simply does not support that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.213" offset="4772805">This Court has said in the case of Pierson v. Ray that the standard to be employed in determining whether Congress has abrogated a well-settled rule of common law is to determine whether Congess made a clear indication that it intended to abrogate that well-settled rule of common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.448" offset="4869772">There must be a specific provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.314" offset="4877191">Well, in the Pierson case, this Court found there was no clear indication by Congress when it enacted Section 1983, and therefore the language in 1983 that says every person did not mean every judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.925" offset="4947617">Similarly, in the case of Tenney v. Brandhove, this Court found that when Congress passed Section 1983, there was no clear indication that it intended to repeal the doctrine of legislative immunity, and therefore the language in 1983 that says ever person did not mean every legislator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.875" offset="5039463">And similarly in this case, if the legislative history does not show a clear indication by Congress that the doctrine of judicial immunity is abrogated, then every person, every judge should not be subjected to an award of attorneys' fees in civil actions brought against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.621" offset="5126399">I mentioned a moment ago the legislative history when I referred to the floor leaders and the chief patrons of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.877" offset="5159418">The proponents and the opponents of Section 1988 both agree that that bill was a limited and cautious step, creating no new remedy, overturning no prior practice or policy except to provide the authority that this Court said in the Alyeska pipeline case was required.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerald L. Baliles</label>
            <text syncTime="1287.281" offset="5293060">Justice Rehnquist, the Court of Appeals below referred to a paragraph containing two sentences and a footnote as the basis for its conclusion that Congress had abrogated the common law doctrine of judicial immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.643" offset="5358575">The court below was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.445" offset="5369756">The House report doesn't simply support that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.213" offset="5384802">Indeed, there is no reference in that report itself to the doctrine of judicial immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.467" offset="5409880">It is not found in the Senate report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.986" offset="5419911">In fact, what the House passed was the Senate bill, and so the Senate bill and the Senate report were really before the House, not the House bill nd the House report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.210" offset="5460766">But notwithstanding that, the House report cited by the court below is an ambiguous reference at best, and this is ironic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.333" offset="5505279">That footnote referred to this Court's decision in Pierson v. Ray where the standard said there must be a clear indication by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.557" offset="5550210">So the fact that that case is cited in the footnote at least should suggest that Congress had to be aware of the standards set by this Court in Pierson, that there must be a clear indication, a specific provision, and you won't find it in that report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.769" offset="5619068">I suspect that the reference to the Pierson case in that footnote, Justice Rehnquist, is simply a reference to the case because that case also involved not only judicial immunity but the qualified or good faith immunity of police officers who were also subject to that lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.416" offset="5701615">In light of the standards that have been set by this Court in the Pierson case for determining what Congress intended, this Court should find that Congress did not intend for Section 1988 legislation to authorize the award of attorneys' fees against a member of the judiciary for acts undertaken in his judicial capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.364" offset="5797432">Now, there is precedent for this Court to hold that the judicial immunity doctrine embraces both damage cases and actions for equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.256" offset="5841005">This Court held that both federal and state legislators are absolutely immune from civil actions, regardless of whether the actions are for damages or whether they are speaking prospective relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.467" offset="5909863">And here is the interesting part: the policy reasons for legislative immunity are identical to the policy reasons for judicial immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.256" offset="5953018">The common law origins are similar, and that is the purpose being to protect the integrity and the independence of the decision-maker, to protect the independence and the integrity of the judicial system, and to prevent the distraction of attention from one's public responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.820" offset="6031281">And because the policies underlying the doctrines of legislative and judicial immunity are identical and the common law origins are similar, common sense would dictate that the rules also should be similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.496" offset="6089899">May it please the Court, this is the bottom line in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.131" offset="6112469">If the Respondents win, this Court will have decided more than just the question of attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.589" offset="6154265">It will have limited the doctrine of judicial immunity and authorized the filing of lawsuits against judges in prospective relief cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.694" offset="6194703">But if the Petitioner prevails, this Court can dispose of the 1988 attorneys' fee issue without deciding the 1983 question of whether judges can be sued in prospective relief cases, and here is how.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.823" offset="6263248">A, this Court can decide that attorneys' fees are barred by the doctrine of judicial immunity because attorneys' fees are the functional equivalent of damages and thus barred by that doctrine; and B, this Court can find that Congress did not intend to abrogate the common law doctrine of judicial immunity when it enacted Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.104" offset="6360423">And the Petitioner thinks that this Court can and should reach the larger issue, the broader question and rule that the doctrine of judicial immunity, like legislative immunity, bars actions, whether for damages or for equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.916" offset="6439627">And so this is what we ask of this court, reverse the lower court's decision and find the following:</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.006" offset="6472019">There is no clear indication that Congress intended for Section 1988 to repeal the common law doctrine of judicial immunity and to authorize attorneys' fees to be awarded against judges for actions taken in their judicial capacity; and two, attorneys' fees against judges are barred by the doctrine of judicial immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1618.381" offset="6617468">At issue in this case is a $7000 award of attorneys' fees which has been paid by the state, an award which was entered following the correction of a glaring constitutional violation, a violation of the rights of my indigent clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.342" offset="6693328">The question before this Court is whether judicial immunity is going to defeat such an award, defeat such vindication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.548" offset="6734183">As Petitioner described, this case stems from a practice by a local county magistrate of incarcerating persons for nonincarcerable offenses when they could not post bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.958" offset="6791757">It was a practice which in a five month period affected approximately 50 people, 34 of whom were incarcerated, including my two clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.016" offset="6831986">One of my clients was incarcerated for 14 days when he couldn't post a $250 bond for a nonincarcerable offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1997.169" offset="8132675">The only issue, however, the only issue that was appealed, whatever happened at the District Court level, was the attorney fee award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.492" offset="8161932">Congress made clear in its language and in the legislative history that it intended these attorney fee awards to be entered not only against defendants for whom prospective relief is entered, but most particularly in cases in which defendants are immune from damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.571" offset="8246255">The language on its face is very clear, there was nothing whatsoever for Congress to have abrogated, as Petitioner discusses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.777" offset="8287111">First of all, damages do not equal attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.396" offset="8297560">To say that damages equal attorneys' fees is like saying interest equal principal or rent equals purchase money: they spend alike, they look alike, but to anyone who has ever borrowed or rented, the difference is a complete one; and to Congress the difference was complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.258" offset="8364956">Congress intended the attorney fee awards to step in most particularly where damages could not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.078" offset="8392228">And this court has recognized that, in Hutto v. Finney and in Consumers Union, Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union, there this Court recognized that prosecutors immune from damage awards are natural targets for prospective relief, are therefore appropriate defendants for attorney fee awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.425" offset="8473625">Moreover, even if this Court were to consider abrogation necessary, even though Congress intended these to be costs ancillary to prospective relief, which has always been against judicial officers, abrogation there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.136" offset="8540499">This case is an easier one than Hutto v. Finney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.271" offset="8553037">In Hutto v. Finney we were dealing with the Eleventh Amendment, and the main concerns expressed in dissent in that case were that in the area of conflicting interest of constitutional dimension, the Eleventh and Fourteenth Amendments, that is a very sensitive area; extra, explicit language for abrogation is necessary, and we didn't even have states as persons under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.255" offset="8664946">In the present case, we are not dealing with conflicting interests of constitutional dimensions, not conflicting interests of statutory dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.861" offset="8703398">We are not conflicting with really anything but an enactment under the Fourteenth Amendment and a judge-made policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.998" offset="8727953">That is certainly not as sensitive an area as two conflicting constitutional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.502" offset="8750001">Yet we have more explicit indication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.954" offset="8759823">Judges are persons under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.275" offset="8781034">States are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.459" offset="8789811">And moreover, Congress made very clear that one of the purposes in fact in enacting 1988 was to make these remedies available, available against officials who are immune from damages awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.267" offset="8844982">This Court said that in Consumers Union where this Court stated, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.688" offset="8862745">"The House Committee report on the act indicates that Congress intended to permit attorneys' fees awards against, when prospective relief is entered against defendants immune from damages awards. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.931" offset="8919692">This Court recognizes, Congress recognizes, everywhere in Congress', in the Senate and House reports, reference is made to Newman v. Piggie Park which, of course, was a case where it was recognized that when damages are not available, that is when injunctive relief is all that's available, and it is so much more important then to have attorney fees available, and this case exemplifies that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2976.749" offset="12050938">Pierson v. Ray dealt with police officers and judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.701" offset="12066716">Police officers were not entitled to preclusive immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.188" offset="12080717">There were three cases cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.405" offset="12085628">The only one that had a preclusive immunity was Pierson v. Ray, and that was for judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.676" offset="12106631">But no, they didn't use the term judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.626" offset="12114468">Throughout, however, 1988, there are references to the principle enunciated in Newman v. Piggie Park, which is where you can't get damages, the private attorney general enforcement is all the more important, and in fact, this case exemplifies that as well, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.356" offset="12189387">The public attorney general vigorously defended the conduct in this case, making the private enforcement all the more important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.993" offset="12219898">Now, there has been some discussion about this application of 1988 expanding the use of 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.515" offset="12246020">I think Justice Harlan concurring in Bivens, had an appropriate perspective to that, that is really Congress' concern and should not cut back on constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.888" offset="12287503">But certainly, to apply that principle to this case would be to throw the baby out with the bath water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.625" offset="12310490">This was a correct application of 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.561" offset="12326164">It served the vindication purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.446" offset="12337762">It served the purpose of allowing prospective relief to be had by persons who were indigent, could not have gotten it otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.301" offset="12373184">It served the private attorney general purpose, and this Court has already recognized in Hutto, in White v. New Hampshire, in Consumers Union, that attorneys' fees do not equal damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.526" offset="12422085">Again, they are both money, but they are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.978" offset="12431908">One, Congress said, is to be ancillary... they said this in the House and Senate reports... is to be treated as ancillary, which of course ties in with this Court's language regarding the Eleventh Amendment, ancillary to prospective relief, whether we like it or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3087.673" offset="12494601">Going back to the Attorney General's point that judges might be just as apprehensive or nearly as apprehensive about the prospect of attorneys' fees being awarded against them as damages, have you given any thought to the fact that in quite a number of cases, under 1988, judges, including federal judges, have awarded costs against the nonprevailing party, and the judge, if he has been doing his homework, would note that even if he won the case, in a situation like yours, he might be charged with some attorneys' fees on the ground that the plaintiff had done something useful?</text>

            <text syncTime="3152.698" offset="12754781">What was resurrected in its place was 1988, which does not... really does not give any provision for such an award as you were just describing short of bad faith, and if a judge has been vexatious, delaying the litigation, I believe this Court has recognized in furtherance of the Court's docket and its control of its courts, a federal court could give a bad faith award to a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.949" offset="12867734">These concerns, let me add, are equally applicable with equal or more force to all other officials who are available to be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.740" offset="12906918">To the extent that this applies to federal judges, as Petitioner has indicated, it can apply to the President of the United States as well, which this Court has held is not immune from prospective relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.779" offset="12951117">He can be stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.112" offset="12956446">A local magistrate should be able to be stopped, always has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.481" offset="12969925">And there is no more chilling, inhibiting effect on a local magistrate than on anyone else against whom 1988 attorneys' fees can be assessed, and then paid, in most cases, all cases of which I am aware, by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.692" offset="13034709">I would like to make one final point on the prospective relief, if I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.394" offset="13049547">In addition to the fact there was no alternative remedy, there is no sound justification for this extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.131" offset="13072534">Moreover, Pierson, Imbler, Tenney all rested, all rested on the proposition that these immunities there were so firmly entrenched, so well grounded in history and reason that it had to be assumed Congress took them into account in passing 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.295" offset="13153096">And because it made no mention of it, they survived 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.180" offset="13172636">What can be said about immunity from prospective relief?</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.318" offset="13189250">Judges have never been considered immune from prospective relief, as this Court as recognized as recently as 1981, and therefore, I think it--</text>
