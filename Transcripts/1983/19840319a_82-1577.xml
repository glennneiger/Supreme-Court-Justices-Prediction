            <text syncTime="97.156" offset="529819">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.516" offset="543193">This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.018" offset="557195">The issue in this case is whether a Michigan statute conflicts with and therefore is preempted by an Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.373" offset="590632">The Act of Congress is the Agricultural Fair Practices Act of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.247" offset="606201">It was designed by Congress to safeguard an individual farmer's right to join or not to join a cooperative association.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.882" offset="640682">It was also designed by Congress to strengthen the competitive marketing system for commodities in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.667" offset="667850">The Michigan state statute is the Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Act of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.190" offset="697943">In contrast to the federal Act, the Michigan Act imposes a union model on agriculture in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.765" offset="724274">It compels unwilling farmers to adhere to the prices, terms, and service fees of a cooperative association.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.100" offset="757606">It compels unwilling purchasers to negotiate with cooperative associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.595" offset="779549">Appellants do not contend that the federal Act has occupied this field of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.938" offset="808911">We contend instead that the Michigan Act and the specific provisions of the Michigan Act stand as an obstacle to the full purposes of the federal Act by destroying rights created or protected in the federal Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.700" offset="871918">Mr. Scoville, the same might be said of the legislation in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.423" offset="898877">I am curious to know whether you think that portions of the California Act are also invalid under your view.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.106" offset="973587">The California Act does not purport to bind unwilling farmers by the decisions of the cooperative.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.819" offset="1056447">--Perhaps we are not talking about the same California Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.642" offset="1067732">There are two California Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.023" offset="1077241">One is the California pro rate Act, and the other is the California bargaining one.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.676" offset="1091869">I am confused as to which one Your Honor is talking about.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="240.757" stopTime="243.368">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="240.757" offset="1104199">Well, you can address both.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_g_scoville" startTime="243.368" stopTime="384.781">
            <label>Mr. Joseph G. Scoville</label>
            <text syncTime="243.368" offset="1114648">The California bargaining Act, which is the one that is analogous to the Michigan Act, the one that directly regulates agricultural marketing and bargaining, is not at all like the Michigan Act in the two particulars that I mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.150" offset="1185805">First, unwilling farmers are not affected at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.593" offset="1199494">Unwilling farmers are free to market their products free from the cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.707" offset="1224049">They need not support the cooperative, and the cooperative's decisions have nothing to do with the unwilling farmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.201" offset="1253933">Furthermore, Your Honor, although there is a duty to bargain to impasse under the California bargaining law, the duty to bargain between cooperatives and purchasers is not so draconian as it is under the Michigan Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.217" offset="1342018">Under the Michigan Act, if a purchaser and a cooperative do not agree a certain time before the marketing season begins, the purchaser must either submit to compulsory arbitration, in which the price and other terms and conditions of trade will be fixed for him, arbitration, or he must buy nothing from any member of the bargaining unit in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.252" offset="1438148">He is, in other words, thrown out of the state of Michigan for that particular crop.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.703" offset="1456016">In those two important respects, the Michigan Act is much different from the California Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.939" offset="1484960">The California pro rate law, Your Honor, is a marketing order Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.773" offset="1508261">It is very analogous to the federal Act, the Federal Marketing Agreements Act of 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.497" offset="1531144">It has nothing to do with cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.137" offset="1537727">A marketing order Act like the federal or California Act tries to control the supply of an agricultural commodity, and the marketing orders, although approved by a majority of farmers, are also approved by an agency of the state of California, and that is the big difference between the Michigan Act here under attack and the federal law in which federal marketing orders are issued by the Secretary of Agriculture and the California state Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.781" offset="1680251">Have you identified any other state agricultural marketing Acts which you feel have the same problems as Michigan's?</text>

          <turn speaker="joseph_g_scoville" startTime="394.639" stopTime="472.650">
            <label>Mr. Joseph G. Scoville</label>
            <text syncTime="394.639" offset="1719748">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.690" offset="1723928">As we say in our reply brief, none of the other state bargaining Acts impinges on the rights of non-consenting farmers to the extent the Michigan Act does.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.270" offset="1770217">For instance, in Minnesota, the Act expressly says that the cooperative may not bargain on behalf of or assess fees against any unwilling farmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.264" offset="1810237">That is a distinction of great magnitude between the Minnesota Act and the Michigan Act, because the Michigan Act makes unwilling farmers a part of the cooperative in every important economic respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.666" offset="1879827">I will turn, if I may, to the facts of this controversy, because I think they show the interest of the appellants very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.275" offset="1922250">In December of 1973, the appellee board, acting pursuant to the Michigan Act, certified a bargaining unit for processing asparagus in the state of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.924" offset="1984839">The board defined that unit to include all Michigan farmers who grew a certain minimum quantity of asparagus for sale--</text>

            <text syncTime="480.026" offset="2061325">It has traditionally been concentrated in the western side of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.219" offset="2082014">Like cherries and apples?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_g_scoville" startTime="488.872" stopTime="913.270">
            <label>Mr. Joseph G. Scoville</label>
            <text syncTime="488.872" offset="2096643">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.403" offset="2098733">The same is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.184" offset="2105943">The board determined that 433 asparagus farmers in the state of Michigan fit into the certified bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.215" offset="2154008">Thereafter, appellee MACMA, which is a cooperative, entered into signed exclusive agency agreements with 236 of those 433 farmers, or 55 percent of the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.980" offset="2201133">MACMA then petitioned the appellee board for accredited status under the Act, and MACMA was entitled to a credited status because it had signed exclusive agency agreements with over 50 percent of the farmers in the bargaining unit who themselves produced over 50 percent of the crop in that unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.846" offset="2292561">In January of 1974, the board accredited MACMA under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.440" offset="2314922">Now, under the Act, accredited status has two major consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.613" offset="2335611">First, MACMA became the exclusive bargaining agent for all 433 farmers in the bargaining unit, whether or not those farmers consented.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.778" offset="2372287">Second, all purchasers were required to negotiating with MACMA, and were forbidden from negotiating with any individual farmer, including the 197 farmers who did not consent to MACMA representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.849" offset="2440519">Thereafter, the appellees as plaintiffs... I am sorry, the appellants, plaintiffs below, began this action in the state Circuit Court to declare the Michigan Act unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.598" offset="2487539">Ferris Pierson and Dukesherer Farms, two of the appellants, were two of the 197 Michigan asparagus farmers who did not want to be represented by MACMA and did not want to pay the 1 and a half percent compulsory service fee on their gross produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.551" offset="2563399">They initiated this action in order to vindicate their right, protected by the federal Act, not to join a cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.026" offset="2597254">The other appellants are purchasers of agricultural commodities in the state of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.599" offset="2627556">They began this action to vindicate their right protected by Section 2304 of the federal Act not to be compelled to negotiate or deal with a cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.957" offset="2673009">The Michigan courts rejected appellant's claim of repugnancy between the state and federal Acts, and this appeal followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.923" offset="2704878">In order to decide this appeal, this Court will have to answer basic questions about the objectives of the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.208" offset="2738001">Is one of the objectives of the federal Act to safeguard the right of an individual farmer not to join cooperative?</text>
            <text syncTime="658.465" offset="2774991">Is another objective of the federal Act to safeguard the right of a purchaser not to deal with cooperatives?</text>
            <text syncTime="666.860" offset="2808637">If so, the Michigan Act must fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.233" offset="2822116">The Michigan Supreme Court admitted as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.935" offset="2832878">It admitted that the existence of such federal rights would be fatal to the Michigan Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.986" offset="2853149">The Michigan court stated in its opinion, which is reproduced in our jurisdictional statement appendix, and I am reading now from Page A-8,</text>
            <text syncTime="687.113" offset="2889616">"were we to agree that Section 2304 or any provision in the federal Act was meant to affirmatively create or protect rights of private dealings between individual producers and processors, we would agree that the state Act must fall, because plainly the state Act conflicts with that result. "</text>
            <text syncTime="708.577" offset="2975507">The Michigan Supreme Court avoided a conflict between the two Acts by holding that the federal Act did not create an absolute right in a farmer to join or not to join a cooperative, and created no rights in processors.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.636" offset="3039663">We submit that the Michigan Supreme Court was clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.439" offset="3054919">The federal Act was expressly designed by Congress to create and preserve federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.774" offset="3080310">I turn first to the rights of farmers under the federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.496" offset="3099118">That Congress intended to preserve an individual farmer's right to join or not join a cooperative is plain from the face of the federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.305" offset="3142377">Section 2301 is a statement of Congressional policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.257" offset="3154184">It emphasizes the rights of individual farmers, not the rights of cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.710" offset="3176023">Section 2301 says that the welfare of</text>
            <text syncTime="763.442" offset="3194935">"individual farmers will be adversely affected unless they are free to join together voluntarily in cooperative. "</text>
            <text syncTime="770.848" offset="3224610">Section 2301 goes on to say,</text>
            <text syncTime="773.600" offset="3235582">"Interference with this right is contrary to the public interest. "</text>
            <text syncTime="777.882" offset="3252718">To safeguard this right, Section 2303(a) of the federal Act creates certain unfair practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.478" offset="3287095">The first unfair practice is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.010" offset="3301201">A handler is forbidden to do the following: to coerce any producer in the exercise of his right to join and belong to or refrain from joining and belonging to a cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.169" offset="3353864">I emphasize that Congress used the words</text>
            <text syncTime="806.511" offset="3367239">"right to join and belong to or to refrain from joining and belonging to. "</text>
            <text syncTime="810.973" offset="3385107">Section 2303(c) likewise prohibits a handler from coercing farmers into or out of membership agreements or contracts of a cooperative or a processor.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.115" offset="3453652">It is critical for the Court to realize that the statutory definition of handler includes agricultural cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.764" offset="3512271">In this way, Congress expressly regulated the relationship between cooperatives and unwilling farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.769" offset="3540274">In Section 2303, Congress prohibited cooperatives from coercing any unwilling farmer to join them.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.646" offset="3583742">The Supreme Court of Michigan ignored this important fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.299" offset="3598370">In interpreting the federal Act, it equated the terms 7 of the Michigan Supreme Court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.838" offset="3664512">It was only by making this basic error that the Michigan Supreme Court was able to say that the federal Act affects cooperatives only indirectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.875" offset="3704637">It was only by making this basic error that the Michigan Supreme Court was able to say that the relationship between cooperatives and unwilling farmers was federally unregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.254" offset="3750194">The Michigan Supreme Court was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.415" offset="3758867">Congress directly regulated the relationship between cooperatives and unwilling farmers.</text>

            <text syncTime="928.491" offset="3855102">The Supreme Court said that the federal Act was not designed to create any federal right to join or not join a cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.636" offset="3887703">It said that the federal Act was designed only to prohibit certain bad acts, certain acts of handler coercion and intimidation, and that Congress was not concerned with the underlying economic right of a farmer to join or not join a cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.929" offset="3968891">In other words, Congress was concerned only that farmers lead tranquil lives, free of coercion, fraud, and intimidation, but that Congress somehow was unconcerned about the basic core economic right of how a farmer may market his or her product, and the legislative history, Your Honor, is replete with discussion and consideration of the economic right to market through a cooperative or market individually, and to limit the scope of the federal Act prohibiting bad acts, and not give protection to the basic economic right protected in the federal Act really renders the Act negatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1028.928" offset="4256865">Yes, sir, without also recognizing there and then throughout the opinion that "handler" also means "cooperative".</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.591" offset="4287481">For instance, Your Honor, at Page A-14 of the Michigan Supreme Court's opinion, it says FAFDA's producer protections only indirectly affect cooperative associations as associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.197" offset="4389985">The only way to make that statement is to ignore the fact that cooperatives are handlers and are subject to direct federal restraint in Section 2303.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.567" offset="4435438">Elsewhere in the opinion, the Michigan Supreme Court says that the Michigan legislature took a step into a federally unregulated area in restructuring the arrangements between cooperatives and unwilling farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.007" offset="4497192">The only way to say that is... the only way to conclude that is to say that the relationship between cooperatives and unwilling farmers is not regulated in the federal Act, and that stems from their basic definitional mistake in failing to realize that cooperatives are handlers under the federal law, and expressly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.611" offset="4591650">The Michigan Act has a destructive effect on the federal rights that we have just been talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.992" offset="4657165">The Michigan Act imposes a majority rule on Michigan farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.724" offset="4676078">Once 50 percent of farmers in a bargaining unit who represent 50 percent of the crop in that unit have signed up with a cooperative, all unwilling farmers are then swept into the cooperative sphere of influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.497" offset="4751206">Those farmers must adhere to the price and other terms negotiated by the cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.210" offset="4773985">Those farmers must pay the service fee on everything they sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.605" offset="4799585">Those farmers may not negotiate on their own behalf with purchasers, and worst of all, if the cooperative that is representing these people against their will fails for any reason to come to an agreement with a particular purchaser, and that purchaser does not want to go to bargaining arbitration, that unwilling farmer may not sell to that purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.174" offset="4913897">In other words, the Michigan law allows cooperatives to totally dominate unwilling farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.741" offset="4948170">In summary, if the Court please, the Michigan legislature and the Congress of the United States responded to the same question with different answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.420" offset="5006893">Congress took a careful look at a very narrow question: what shall the relationship be among cooperatives, unwilling farmers, and purchasers, and Congress determined that unwilling farmers would have a federal right to stay free of cooperatives, that willing farmers would have a federal right to join cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.374" offset="5094664">Congress also determined that purchasers could not discriminate against a farmer because of that farmer's membership in a cooperative, but by the same token, that purchasers could not be compelled to bargain with a cooperative, and I have not had time this morning to talk about the compulsory bargaining provisions of the Michigan Act in any detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.369" offset="5186615">I refer the Court to our brief and reply brief on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.501" offset="5199154">The Michigan Act upsets this careful balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.326" offset="5218485">Michigan answers the question differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.077" offset="5229456">Michigan says that the individual right of a farmer must be subsumed by the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.363" offset="5262579">That is to say, Michigan takes the decision on whether to join a coop away from the individual farmer and puts it in the hand of a majority of farmers in his unit and in the hands of the cooperative association that represents that majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.671" offset="5327885">The two approaches cannot be reconciled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.004" offset="5341156">For that reason, we ask this Court to reverse the Michigan Supreme Court judgment, and to declare that the challenged sections of the Michigan Act are unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1324.441" offset="5438958">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, let me begin by saying a word about Justice Stevens' concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.566" offset="5471454">Appellees have contended that the Michigan Act is not preempted by the federal Act in this case because the federal Act only applies to handlers, and Michigan is not a handler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.635" offset="5515758">That observation might be more pertinent if the claim in this case were that Michigan had violated the federal Act, but that is not the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.741" offset="5552121">The claim is that the Michigan Act is preempted by the federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.802" offset="5568421">For example, Michigan Act forbidding farmers to consistent with the federal Act forbidding farmers to join cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.127" offset="5601649">That would be inconsistent with the purposes of Section 2303(a) and (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.372" offset="5622651">For the same reason, Michigan cannot pass a law requiring farmers to join cooperatives, because in Sections 2303(a) and (c) the right not to join a cooperative is guaranteed in the same language as the right to join a cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.743" offset="5688166">Appellees also raise a number of other points about how Michigan's Act doesn't actually require membership in an association, and about how Michigan's Act is somehow not preempted because it involves state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.574" offset="5759428">If the Court is troubled by those, I will be happy to respond to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.387" offset="5774684">Otherwise, I propose to spend a few minutes talking about what the purposes of the federal Act are, and how Michigan's Act is inconsistent with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.243" offset="5814181">The government contends that Michigan's Act is preempted by the Agricultural Fair Practices Act insofar as it requires that unwilling farmers be represented by the accredited cooperative, and requires unwilling farmers to pay financial support to cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.519" offset="5907281">The federal Act says that cooperatives may not control unwilling farmers in their relations with handlers, and may not force unwilling farmers to join.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.787" offset="5956287">The Michigan Act makes a cooperative the exclusive representative of an unwilling farmer in his dealing with handlers, and requires the unwilling farmer to pay financial support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.045" offset="6001322">The reason that Congress insisted in the federal Act that cooperative membership be voluntary and the cooperatives not control unwilling farmers dealing with handlers were several.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.008" offset="6069241">In the first place, that had long been a requirement of the antitrust laws, even before the Agricultural Fair Practices Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.101" offset="6097557">For example, a cooperative could violate Section 2 of the Sherman Act by engaging in predatory practices against farmers who refused to join.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.217" offset="6134024">That is the holding of the Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers case cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.661" offset="6151788">Or, to take a case that is maybe even closer to this case, a cooperative could violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act by agreeing with buyers about the price they would pay to non-members of the cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.088" offset="6197554">That is the holding of the Borden case, cited in the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.531" offset="6211242">The second reason Congress was concerned... Congress insisted that cooperative membership remain voluntary was that there were some independent farmers who simply were unhappy about paying fees to cooperative associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.400" offset="6274772">Representative Iatta said on the House floor,</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.084" offset="6285534">"The fees being charged by these associations are no small matter to the farmer. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.409" offset="6306850">"Some of these associations are assessing members 1 percent of their gross. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.891" offset="6324718">So, I think it is important that with the House amendments the farmer still has the right to say no to an association.</text>

            <text syncTime="1596.154" offset="6525757">What I mean to say is that because the Agricultural Fair Practices Act has a number of purposes that are unrelated to the purposes of the antitrust laws, that the fact that it is also consistent with the antitrust laws doesn't make Parker against Brown decisive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.510" offset="6623245">Well, you say it is not decisive, but does it have some role to play in deciding whether or not the Michigan law is preempted?</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Garvey</label>
            <text syncTime="1628.285" offset="6654279">Well, let me try and explain it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.318" offset="6662429">What the appellees say is, the Michigan statute is not preempted by the federal Act because it involves state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.633" offset="6703703">The very purpose of the supremacy clause is to forbid state action which is inconsistent with federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.931" offset="6744872">What Parker against Brown says is that there are some kinds of state actions that are not preempted by the Sherman Act, and those have come to be called state action cases, where the state gets involved in fixing prices, but that is not... To say that this case involves state action only sets up the question about whether what Congress was trying to do is frustrated by what Michigan has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.226" offset="6854063">In addition to the consistency of the Ag Fair Practices Act with the antitrust laws, I was about to suggest that there are a number of other purposes that underlie it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.864" offset="6900666">For example, the protection of farmers who don't want to pay fees to an association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.749" offset="6920205">Another example might be that in the course of the passage there was considerable concern expressed that if farmers had to join cooperatives, buyers of agricultural products couldn't shop around for quality or price terms that were different from those offered by the cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.490" offset="6995125">There was also some sense that competition among cooperatives was beneficial to the farmer, competition among cooperatives for farmers' membership, but that if membership in cooperatives were not voluntary, the decision about what one to join mightn't be made on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.572" offset="7067432">So, because Michigan's Act is inconsistent with those purposes as well as the antitrust theme that underlies the voluntariness requirement, it is preempted by the federal statute even if it might be state action under some Parker against Brown analysis, although I might suggest that it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.628" offset="7155725">I was about to say that what Michigan's Act does is to authorize private parties, that is to say, farmers and handlers, to set the price in their private dealings at which other farmers may buy and sell their goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.479" offset="7235033">That is quite similar to the private action... the non-signer provision in Louisiana's statute that this Court held invalid in Stregman Brothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.307" offset="7274426">It is also quite similar to the California statute which required private parties to set prices in Midcal Aluminum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.682" offset="7307863">This Court said that that sort of leaving to private parties about the price at which people should buy and sell was inconsistent with Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.917" offset="7348823">So even if state action were relevant, this wouldn't qualify as state action, but as I say, the Ag Fair Practices Act, while consistent with the purposes of the antitrust laws, also has a number of other purposes which are frustrated by the Michigan Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1901.044" offset="7745361">What I was saying is that there is a difference between making farmers do what a cooperative association wants them to do on the one hand and making them do what state law directs through a prorate program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.843" offset="7800532">As Mr. Scoville suggested, the closer analogy to what Michigan has done is not California's pro rate law, with which this Court dealt in Parker against Brown, but California's Cooperative Bargaining Association Act, which only last year was amended to provide for collective bargaining between cooperative associations and handlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.397" offset="7894782">That California bargaining law, which deals with cooperative associations, unlike the pro rate law, that California bargaining law does not require representation of unwilling farmers by the bargaining association.</text>

            <text syncTime="2165.736" offset="8804157">Let's first talk about the fair share fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.570" offset="8823487">They argue that because under the Michigan statute all growers and farmers that are affected by that or come within the purview of the bargaining unit must pay to the sole exclusive bargaining representative a fee, that this is coercive of their right not to join.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.046" offset="8917319">We do not believe that the payment of a fair share bargaining fee as part of a collective bargaining system set up by a state is coercive of a farmer's right not to join that organization that may be their sole exclusive bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.650" offset="9015748">This Court implicitly seemed to recognize in the recent decision that we have handed down within this past month in Minnesota Community College Faculty Association versus Knight that the payment of a fair share bargaining fee was not coercive of a person's associational right, and although I simply...

I guess the argument of the Solicitor General that under NLRB versus General Motors, that that somehow indicates that there was a Congressional intent somehow not to require anyone to join or not to join when he states that there was... one was the financial equivalent of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.844" offset="9528584">But I do not think that that analogy is appropriate here, because I thank that what we were dealing there with was the interpretation of a federal statute which expressly permitted... first of all, there was pervasive and comprehensive legislation establishing a collective bargaining plan for workers in interstate commerce, and the question that was raised in that case was whether or not when Congress indicated in Section that they could have a union shop, that they could negotiate... the union could negotiate the union shop, did that in and of itself preclude the negotiation then of so-called lesser item of agency shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.652" offset="9755745">And what the Court said in essence as I read NLRB versus General Motors and the Shemerhorn case, cases, is that they will let each state interpret its own right to work law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3362.259" offset="13590207">I think that 2303(a) protects the farmer against coercion by a handler, which includes... which under the federal Act includes both the cooperative and a processor, from coercion to join or not to join, but I think it is important... look at... we talk about legislative history, if I could for just a second here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.912" offset="13716849">looking at the Senate Agricultural Committee report, they make it absolutely clear what was intended to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.481" offset="13775050">When the state... in the report of the Senate Agricultural Committee in suggesting passage of this Act, the federal Act, says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.031" offset="13821339">"The fact is clear that an association of producers which has obtained the voluntary membership of a large number of farmers deserves the respect and recognition by handlers of agricultural products. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.237" offset="13874106">The House Committee report stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.322" offset="13898452">"This legislation is necessary in order to give farmers and their marketing associations new and greater market power. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.088" offset="13941502">It seems to me that we have years of Congressional encouragement of farmers to enter into collective action so as to protect themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.279" offset="14002315">This Court certainly was not unaware of the plight of the farmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.154" offset="14021750">For example, in the National Broilers case, this Court clearly recognized the plight of the individual farmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.299" offset="14070338">Justice Blackmun indicated in that decision,</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.433" offset="14086952">"Farmers were seen as being caught in the hands of processors and distributors who because of their position in the market and their relative economic strength were able to take from the farmer a good share of whatever profits might be available from agricultural production. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.353" offset="14146615">"By allowing farmers to join together in cooperatives, Congress hoped to bolster their market strength and to improve their ability to weather adverse economic periods, and to deal with processors and distributors. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.341" offset="14202517">Now, there again, this isn't determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.454" offset="14219027">That was a Capper-Volstead case, and the extent to which the Court would permit the extension of the Capper-Volstead protection to cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.322" offset="14266465">But I think throughout this we have recognition by the courts and by Congress of the vulnerability of the farmer, and I understand that the National Food Processors and American Food Institute very well may not want to deal with cooperatives, but to say this federal Act which was in effect very narrow in scope and was intended to protect farmers had as its intention to divest the states of their right to pass meaningful collective bargaining things for farmers is just--</text>
