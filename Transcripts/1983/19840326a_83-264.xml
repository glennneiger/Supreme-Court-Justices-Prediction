            <label>Mr. Paul Farrell Strain</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="135174">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.458" offset="604960">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.879" offset="626590">It arises from the discharge of two state employees, the Respondents here who were members of the administrative staff of the president of Coppin State College.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.503" offset="673087">The Respondents are white.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.205" offset="683954">Coppin State is predominantly black and black-managed.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.859" offset="702554">The Respondents sued, claiming racial discrimination and, in one case, sex discrimination; and basing their claims on the Civil Rights Statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.631" offset="745603">The question is whether the statute of limitations of Maryland's Fair Employment Practice Statute is the best analogy to Respondents' suit, or whether the fact that the Fair Employment Statute remedy is not a purely judicial cause of action makes it inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.962" offset="830972">I will argue that Maryland's Fair Employment Statute is the wholly appropriate analogy; second, that there are sound reasons of public policy supporting its application to Respondents' suit; and finally, that the Maryland statutory six-month limitation period is fully adequate for Respondents to assert their cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.279" offset="928252">As to the first issue concerning the appropriate analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.349" offset="952493">Maryland's Fair Employment Practice Statute which is Article 49B of the Maryland Code is the closest analogy to Respondents' suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.305" offset="996379">And in that regard, it has almost no competition concerning which is the analogous statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="223.245" stopTime="260.353">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="223.245" offset="1028144">On that point, I notice that the Respondent cited a case, federal case Davidson v. Koerber that referred to Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, in which the District Court held that it's beyond dispute that Maryland's Article 23 protects the same interests as the 14th Amendment, and therefore Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.664" offset="1141829">You think the Respondents could have brought an action under Article 23 in this case, then, in Maryland?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_f_strain" startTime="260.353" stopTime="280.433">
            <label>Mr. Paul Farrell Strain</label>
            <text syncTime="260.353" offset="1176519">Justice O'Connor, I think the Respondents very definitely could not have brought an action under Article 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.173" offset="1199821">Let me correct that slightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.673" offset="1201806">They did bring an action under Article 23, and as the district judge found, there is no action under Article 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.695" offset="1233884">Maryland courts have never recognized any direct action under the Maryland Constitution.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="280.433" stopTime="285.968">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="280.433" offset="1256872">Despite that Davidson v. Koerber case; is that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_f_strain" startTime="285.968" stopTime="372.276">
            <label>Mr. Paul Farrell Strain</label>
            <text syncTime="285.968" offset="1279024">That's correct, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.420" offset="1288846">Judge Miller in the Davidson case did not address the issue of whether Maryland courts have recognized a direct action.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.276" offset="1324268">Judge Miller did address the issue of the appropriate analogy, but he was evidently not presented with the issue of whether there was such an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.648" offset="1357705">Of course, if the Maryland courts were to address the issue of whether there is a direct cause of action under the Maryland Constitution, I think for the same considerations that led this Court in Bush v. Lucas not to infer such a cause of action where there is a comprehensive statutory scheme, for that same reason, I would expect the Maryland court... Maryland Court of Appeals not to infer direct cause of action for employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.984" offset="1471076">And after all, that is what Respondents Grattan and Hedman are challenging.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.603" offset="1489571">Their cause of action is for employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.055" offset="1503363">And Article 49B is the state cause of action for Respondents Grattan and Hedman, and there is no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.029" offset="1543278">Where we part company with the Respondents is in their claim that the fact that Article 49B is not purely judicial defeats the analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.253" offset="1588105">And I submit that neither the language nor the logic of this Court's decisions justify Respondents' position.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="372.276" stopTime="385.166">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="372.276" offset="1624258">Mr. Strain, the Court of Appeals, though, said that the Maryland legislature intended the three-year statute of limitations period to apply to Section 1983 actions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_f_strain" startTime="385.166" stopTime="418.888">
            <label>Mr. Paul Farrell Strain</label>
            <text syncTime="385.166" offset="1675772">Justice O'Connor, I don't recall that precise language in Chief Judge Winters' opinion for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.920" offset="1702834">I think I recall language of Chief Judge Winter where he questioned whether the Maryland legislature intended the Fair Employment Statute to apply to Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.080" offset="1755393">I don't think he suggested that the catch-all provision, Article 5-101 of the court's article was intended to apply to Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.936" offset="1790815">If he did say that, I submit very respectfully, he was very wrong.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="418.888" stopTime="434.949">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="418.888" offset="1810668">Well, what if a legislative body expressly said it intended a longer statute of limitations to apply, would you give recognition to that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_f_strain" startTime="434.949" stopTime="449.526">
            <label>Mr. Paul Farrell Strain</label>
            <text syncTime="434.949" offset="1874929">Justice O'Connor, if for example the Maryland legislature had intended the catch-all provisions to apply to civil rights statutes, I think that would be important to this Court in determining what was the appropriate analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.840" offset="1930518">Nonetheless--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="449.526" stopTime="451.392">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="449.526" offset="1933234">Would it be binding on us?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_f_strain" startTime="451.392" stopTime="491.519">
            <label>Mr. Paul Farrell Strain</label>
            <text syncTime="451.392" offset="1940653">--I think it would not be binding, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.161" offset="1951729">What this Court locks for is the appropriate analogy for the individual Section 1983 cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.917" offset="1982763">If it was the Maryland legislature's intention that all civil rights statutes along with... actions... along with many other things, be governed by a three-year statute, that would be a point that this court would consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.593" offset="2037515">It would not be binding on this Court anymore than would have been the intention of the New York legislature in the actions to vacate arbitration awards have been binding on this Court in Del Costello or United Parcel Service.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="491.519" stopTime="500.725">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="491.519" offset="2101150">Although I guess we haven't really decided that question, have we?</text>
            <text syncTime="495.388" offset="2116718">Whether a legislative express intention would be binding.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_f_strain" startTime="500.725" stopTime="786.193">
            <label>Mr. Paul Farrell Strain</label>
            <text syncTime="500.725" offset="2138034">Justice O'Connor, I think this Court has not directly decided the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.112" offset="2155589">However, in the Del Costello opinion, there was a footnote... and I don't recall the number offhand... but a footnote which dealt with the argument that the Congress, in enacting Section 10(b) of the NLRA, had not intended it to apply to Secton 301 suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.109" offset="2243569">And this Court observed that the fact that Congress had not intended that it apply to Section 301 suits was no more dispositive than the fact that the New York or Maryland legislatures had not intended their statutes for actions to vacate arbitration awards to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.903" offset="2318697">And I think, while this Court has not decided it, that footnote may give a strong indication of how this Court would go.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.593" offset="2345447">And as I said, I think there is nothing in either the language or the logic of this Court's decisions which supports the Respondents' position that a statute must be purely judicial for borrowing purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.019" offset="2407200">There's certainly nothing in the language of this Court's opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.888" offset="2422665">In the Del Costello v. Teamsters opinion last term, this Court for a Section 301 suit borrowed the Section 10(b) limitations period, and the Section 10(b) administrative judicial process is remarkably similar to that of Maryland's Article 49B.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.051" offset="2503331">In fact, the roots of Maryland's Article 49B process can be traced to the National Labor Relations Act process and Section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="603.526" offset="2549202">And there was no suggestion in any of the three opinions of this Court that any member of the Court thought that applying a limitations period of a statute that was not purely judicial was in any way untoward.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.802" offset="2614299">And it is not only the language; it is also the logic of this Court's opinions that gives the Respondents no support for their position, because as this Court's opinions on borrowing and applying statutes of limitations demonstrate, what the Court is involved in may be termed an inexorable search for the appropriate analogy based on the nature of the cause of action, a search for the best fit; not a perfect fit, not something that is hand-in-glove.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.523" offset="2749195">As the Court observed in the United Parcel Service opinion, the Court does not expect or search for a hand-in-glove perfect analogy, but the best analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.895" offset="2790678">And for that reason... for example, in Section 301 suits such as the United Auto Workers v. Hoosier suit in 1966, the Court searched for the nature of the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.923" offset="2850864">Was it more appropriate to an action on an oral contract or on a written contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.308" offset="2872389">And 15 years later, in the United Parcel Service opinion, the Court made the same inquiry as to the nature of the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.664" offset="2905825">Was it more akin to an action to vacate an arbitration award or more akin to an action on contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="701.670" offset="2941770">And for Section 1983 and other civil rights suits, the inquiry is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.209" offset="2971967">The Court chooses the statute of limitations by borrowing and examining the nature of the cause of action, for in Section 1983, even beyond the rules of decision act and the other principles that apply in Section 301 suits, in Section 1983 this Court has the benefit of, in Section 1988, Congress's invitation for command to utilize the appropriate state limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.914" offset="3106759">And the Court has examined appropriate limitations periods... I should say appropriate causes of action in 1983 suits to determine what is the most appropriate analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.856" offset="3162557">The Runyon v. McCrary decision in 1976 is an apt example.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.910" offset="3190769">In that case, this Court rejected a five-year catch-all limitations period for a Section 1981 suit in favor of a two-year period that was... on which a cause of action depended that was a better analogy for the Section 1981 suit there at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="788.995" offset="3291079">Supposing the underlying claim of a constitutional violation here didn't involve discrimination, but rather, was something like a First Amendment claim or something like that; the employee was discharged for speaking out about some issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.035" offset="3339249">I take it you would then say that that particular 1983 claim... the limitations period for such an 1983 claim would be determined by some other statute, other than the one you're--</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Farrell Strain</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="812.910" offset="3386792">--So you're not contending all 1983 are subject to this?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_f_strain" startTime="816.379" stopTime="843.862">
            <label>Mr. Paul Farrell Strain</label>
            <text syncTime="816.379" offset="3400689">That's very correct, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.997" offset="3407063">In fact, that was the position in this case because one of the initial causes of action was a free speech claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.151" offset="3439768">We argued for a three-year limitations period on the Section 1983 free speech claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.523" offset="3469234">It wasn't within even the three-year period, and the trial judge, Judge Ramsey, knocked out the free speech claim because it was in violation of the three-year period.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="843.862" stopTime="872.132">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="843.862" offset="3510612">There's a certain practical awkwardness about that result, isn't there?</text>
            <text syncTime="849.850" offset="3534541">If a person is suing for unconstitutional dismissal from employment, to the extent his claim may sound in free speech, it's three years; to the extent it may sound in racial discrimination, it's a much different period of time, even though it's the same facts perhaps out of which the thing arises.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_f_strain" startTime="872.132" stopTime="1083.051">
            <label>Mr. Paul Farrell Strain</label>
            <text syncTime="872.132" offset="3623670">Well, Justice Rehnquist, I believe that normally it would not be the same set of facts out of which the claim arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.071" offset="3655435">For example, in this case, the contention was either that they were dismissed on the grounds of race or dismissed because they were speaking out.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.927" offset="3690857">More normally, there would be the coupling of violation of a free speech claim perhaps that did not lead to discharge, and discharge based on racial reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.235" offset="3740072">And the complaint should set out those different causes of action in separate counts, as they did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.341" offset="3772464">So a different limitations period would apply to different counts, as if there was a common law account in contract and account in tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.629" offset="3813633">And in summary, on the point of the purely judicial cause of action, in each of the cases that have been referred to, and in others, the Court has sought the best analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.872" offset="3874655">In Del Costello last term, the most appropriate analogy was an administrative judicial limitations period in Section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="945.514" offset="3917182">And as Justice Blackmon observed for the Court in Railway Express in 1975, when we're talking about civil rights statutes nothing justifies a special reluctance in applying state law, as compared with what the Court does in other situations such as Section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="969.379" offset="4012686">Article 49B is the state analogy to Grattan and Hedman's employment discrimination suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.235" offset="4044033">And Article 49B is an administrative judicial remedy that is a lineal descendent of Section 10(b) which this Court utilized last term in Del Costello.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.959" offset="4094919">The second issue I wish to address this morning concerns the sound policy reasons for borrowing the Fair Employment Practice Statute, statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.634" offset="4157613">An important policy reason in favor of that borrowing is the policy of uniformity.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sheldon H. Laskin</label>
            <text syncTime="1837.072" offset="7483419">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.424" offset="7496794">Petitioner's position is based upon a fundamental error in the analysis of the functional differences between the statute of limitations triggered by Article 49B, Section 9A, and the routine judicial statute of limitations which applies in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.552" offset="7561368">If applied to employment discrimination suits in Maryland, the use of the Section 9A would lead to three harmful effects: It would encourage a multiplicity of statutes of limitations within one state for actions under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983; it would encourage a multiplicity of federal claims which might otherwise not have to be brought, due to the shortness of the period; and it would also encourage individuals to avoid utilizing state procedures which, particularly after this Court's decision in Patsy, should be encouraged rather than discouraged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.357" offset="7700549">First, as to the functional differences, the Respondents have never claimed that 49B is an inappropriate statute of limitations to apply merely because it invokes administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.498" offset="7753107">The reason we say it's an inappropriate period to apply is because of the functional differences in the procedures which are invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.020" offset="7783200">Article 49B, like Title VII, is a multistep enforcement procedure which ultimately culminates in a formal adjudicatory hearing under Section 11 of Article 49B.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.928" offset="7838789">However, all that is invoked by the initial filing of the Section 9A complaint is an administrative investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.617" offset="7873584">It is only after a very lengthy process... and the agency has given itself two years and ten months, in effect, from the date of the discriminatory act to complete that process... a lengthy process of investigation, probable cause-finding, attempts at conciliation which is central to the statutory scheme... only after all of these has failed may the Commission issue a formal statement of charges and compel the Respondent to answer and prepare and present a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.719" offset="7993956">Until that point, all that happens is an administrative investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.540" offset="8017257">The Maryland Court of Appeals has made very clear in the Banach case that the filing of the 9A complaint merely triggers that investigative process, and that a respondent is not entitled to formal notice of the claim in the sense of stating a claim against that respondent until the invocation of the Section 11 enforcement proceedings which, as I've said, can take two years and ten months from the date of the discriminatory action, a period virtually the same as the period we are urging upon the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.244" offset="8148078">If 49B were to be applied to employment discrimination suits within the State of Maryland, it would encourage a multiplicity of statute of limitations within one state for claims under 1983 and 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.790" offset="8210250">1981 and 1983 apply to discrimination claims broader than that of employment discrimination, broader than that of 49B.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.146" offset="8243687">Therefore, if this Court were to hold that the statute of limitations in employment discrimination cases is six months, it would be multiplicity of litigation over the issue of what the appropriate statute of limitations is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.786" offset="8294260">While it is true that national uniformity as applied to 1980 is an impossibility, it does not follow from that that internal uniformity should not be encouraged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.611" offset="8345564">As this Court made clear in Ricks, statutes of limitations should not commence to run so soon that lay people would find it difficult to invoke the procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.533" offset="8381300">If there were a different statute of limitations under each and every 1981 or 1983 claim which might be raised, a lay person might find it very difficult to determine what category they fell into within a very short period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.876" offset="8442635">Temanio is simply irrelevant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.994" offset="8455070">There is no conflict presented between a state law and a federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.732" offset="8474087">There are two state statute of limitations for this Court to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.850" offset="8486521">The Court will inevitably accept one and reject the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.052" offset="8499373">We submit that as a matter of state policy, Article 5-101, the general residuary statute, is a more appropriate statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.860" offset="8542527">Precisely because it covers more conceivable claims than would be presented under 49B, it is both a residuary contract and a residuary tort statute, so unlike litigation in some other jurisdictions, that would not be a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.969" offset="8606998">It would cover simply a greater variety of claims which could be raised under the Federal Civil Right Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.225" offset="8636046">The attorney general has just urged upon the Court in oral argument a separate rule for public employees than that enunciated in McNutt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.348" offset="8672513">This further complicates the multiplicity of statute of limitations question, because what the state is in effect urging is the separate statute of limitations for public employees, a separate statute of limitations for private employees, and a separate statute of limitations for everyone else.</text>

            <text syncTime="2225.889" offset="9038645">Otherwise, there will be a lot of litigation over the status of the plaintiff in order to determine whether or not the proper statute of limitations was invoked with the individuals, an independent contractor, a private or public employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2378.053" offset="9647298">But according to Banach, it is not until the Section 11 proceedings are commenced that the Commission has stated a claim against the respondent and the respondent is required to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.827" offset="9690452">The State Commission reaffirmed Banach to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.831" offset="9710410">It drew a distinction as far as the case was before it, in that in that case, a Section 9A complaint had been filed, the agency wished to issue an investigative subpoena, and for the purposes of determining whether the subpoena was adequate, the 9A complaint had to at least state how the individual was discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.811" offset="9798390">But at page 46, Maryland Appeals 56, the Banach court specifically... I'm sorry, the State Commission v. Baltimore County court specifically reaffirms the Banach court for the proposition that as far as stating a claim, that doesn't have to happen until the Section 11 proceedings are invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.725" offset="9878012">Ironically, the statute which the Petitioners urge upon this Court has the effect of discouraging the use of the very state procedures which the Petitioners would wish to encourage, and it in effect forces federal... I'm sorry... forces individuals to invoke their federal rights in a very rapid manner, rights which may not have to be invoked if a longer federal period were allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.244" offset="9992114">Because of the fact that an individual has six months to file a 49B charge with the Commission, if this Court were to hold that that same period were precisely the period within which an individual has to go to federal court, the individual would very quickly be forced to a choice: to either go through with the administrative procedures, attempting to voluntarily conciliate, which serves both federal and state interests; or file the federal lawsuit or forever lose those federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.096" offset="10115517">The filing of the litigation will have the inevitable effect, chilling the conciliation procedures which the state wishes to foster.</text>

            <text syncTime="2521.848" offset="10222514">I used to be a trial attorney with the EEOC for two years, and at the time that the district courts in Maryland began to hold that the 1981 statute of limitations was six months, in order to preserve their rights, individuals represented by counsel filed a 1981 complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.190" offset="10287925">Inevitably, the employer responded to the EEOC; we have been sued; we're not going to cooperate in the investigation because we don't want it to be informal discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.379" offset="10324601">The reality is that it has the opposite effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.665" offset="10337767">It chills those conciliation procedures once an adversarial process has begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.152" offset="10355739">I just wanted to respond to several things that the state raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.477" offset="10405058">There are 30 states which appear to have administrative statutes of limitations similar to Maryland's statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.248" offset="10436092">In very few of them have the federal courts actually applied those statute of limitations to federal civil rights claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.969" offset="10458975">As far as the Davidson v. Koerber point that Justice O'Connor raised, in fact what the Court of Appeals did in this case was to order the district court to certify the question to the Maryland Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.979" offset="10519056">They didn't reject it out of hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.229" offset="10524072">In fact, the predecessor of 5-101 did provide a three-year period for actions under Article 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.585" offset="10553434">The only reason that statute no longer exists is because in 1974, since there were a number of three-year statutes, the Maryland legislature simplified the code by codifying them into one general residuary statute... 5-101... irrespective of whether there is, in fact, a cause of action under Article 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.129" offset="10631592">That is an indication that the Maryland legislature would have intended, if there were a cause of action, a longer state statute of limitations to apply to such a cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2735.283" offset="11076301">And the reason for that is discussed in the Banach opinion, cited in McNutt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.985" offset="11091034">In fact, I don't have the cites for them, but there were some turn-of-the-century Maryland cases which at least suggested that there was indeed a cause of action under the Maryland Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.258" offset="11132203">There are, however, no recent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.393" offset="11144741">I believe that question is currently before the Maryland Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.863" offset="11158534">In summary, all this case involves is a choice between two state statutes of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.885" offset="11194687">Regardless of what decision this Court reaches, a state statute will be accepted, a state statute will be rejected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2776.908" offset="11242753">Article 5-101 better accommodates both the state interests and utilizing state procedures and federal interests in reducing premature federal claims than would 49B.</text>

            <text syncTime="2802.622" offset="11345571">On the question raised by my colleague of a different time period within Article 49B, there is suggestion that there is a longer time period for an administrative complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.049" offset="11411295">There is only one time period within Article 49B.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.119" offset="11427595">That is, the six-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.302" offset="11436372">That structure, is as I said, a lineal descendant of that in Section 10B.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.058" offset="11463331">There is a Commission complaint procedure, rarely used, not even dependent upon an individual grievance and as to which there is no limitations period whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.116" offset="11511605">What my colleague has confused with a second limitation period is actually a provision that after investigation and a judicial-like weighing of the facts, the Commission General Counsel's Office shall precede a hearing with a statement of charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.177" offset="11591853">This gets us into the minutiae of Article 49B process, but I cannot emphasize enough that there is only one limitations period within Article 49B.</text>
