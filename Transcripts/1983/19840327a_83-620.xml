            <label>Ms. Barbara E. Etkind</label>
            <text syncTime="54.292" offset="346582">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="57.587" offset="359748">This case is here on the petition of the United States to review a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.973" offset="389318">Like the preceding case, this case too involves the construction of 18 U.S.C. 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.378" offset="414918">The facts are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.829" offset="424740">In early June 1982, Respondent telephoned the Kansas City, Missouri, office of the FBI and reported that his wife had been kidnapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.232" offset="462356">The FBI spent more than 100 agent hours investigating the reported kidnapping, only to determine that Respondent's wife had left him voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.401" offset="499032">On June 13th, 1982, Respondent contacted the Kansas City office of the Secret Service and reported that his estranged girl friend, actually his wife, was involved in a plot to assassinate the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.676" offset="552113">The Secret Service spent more than 150 hours investigating this report and finally located Respondent's wife in Phoenix, Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.595" offset="587744">She denied that she had been kidnapped, that she had joined any assassination plot, or that she had ever threatened the President in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.905" offset="620972">Rather, she explained, she had left the Kansas City area in order to get away from Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.026" offset="645527">Respondent subsequently confessed that he had made these false reports to the federal agencies in order to induce them to help locate his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.367" offset="678859">As a result of these acts, Respondent was charged with two counts of violating 18 U.S.C. 1001, which prohibits the knowing and willful making of any false statement</text>
            <text syncTime="149.472" offset="727238">"in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="155.501" offset="751375">The district court dismissed the indictment, however, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal, on the strength of the Court of Appeals' prior decision in Friedman versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.480" offset="795365">In that case, the Eighth Circuit had held that the investigatory jurisdiction possessed by the FBI is not the sort of jurisdiction that Congress contemplated when it used the word 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.177" offset="854089">Rather, the Court of Appeals held that Congress used that word in Section 1001 in the restrictive sense of the power to make monetary awards, grant governmental privileges, or promulgate binding administrative and regulatory determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.233" offset="922321">As both the Second and the Fifth Circuits have already recognized, there is absolutely no basis for the Eighth Circuit's restrictive construction of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.151" offset="962027">This Court has noted on several occasions that Congress spoke in broad language in Section 1001, making it a crime in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States to make any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.658" offset="1040081">And the Court has specifically counseled against narrowing this broad language by construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.969" offset="1061292">In particular, there is no indication that the word "jurisdiction" was intended to distinguish among the nature of governmental functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.216" offset="1094311">In United States against Gilliland, the Court explained that the purpose of Section 1001 is to protect the authorized functions of governmental departments and agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.914" offset="1137047">The "matter within the jurisdiction" language thus was intended only to differentiate between matters constituting the official authorized functions of the department or agency involved, no matter what the nature of those functions, and matters outside the business of that body.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.063" offset="1205697">This construction follows naturally from the fact that the statute encompasses any department or agency of the United States, without reference to the nature of the jurisdiction possessed by the department or agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.074" offset="1257733">But notwithstanding this all-inclusive sweep of the statutory language, the Eighth Circuit's construction would virtually leave the FBI and the Secret Service out of the protection of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.662" offset="1304022">The theoretical distinction that the Eighth Circuit and Respondent have attempted to draw between action that finally disposes of a problem and other types of action does not hold up.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.096" offset="1349788">Action by regulatory agencies, which the Court of Appeals and Respondent concede is within the reach of the statute, frequently does not finally dispose of a problem, because such administrative action is almost always subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.262" offset="1414468">By contrast, when the FBI and the Department of Justice determine, on the basis of an exercise of investigatory jurisdiction, that criminal prosecution is not warranted, that determination is not reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.911" offset="1469011">Indeed, even the narrowest definition of jurisdiction includes the power of the courts to decide the cases pending before them.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.893" offset="1500985">Ms. Etkind, what if the Respondent in this case, instead of reporting that his wife had gone to Phoenix from Kansas City, reported that she had gone to St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.109" offset="1533795">Would that be within the jurisdiction of the FBI?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="391.016" offset="1693455">So the answer's no?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_e_etkind" startTime="391.751" stopTime="534.302">
            <label>Ms. Barbara E. Etkind</label>
            <text syncTime="391.751" offset="1696381">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.642" offset="1699934">Respondent makes several arguments that it contends bear on legislative intent, but in fact these are nothing more than policy considerations that are more properly addressed to Congress than to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.356" offset="1746850">For example, Respondent contends that Section 1001 must not apply to false statements made to law enforcement officers because such conduct is less blameworthy than committing perjury in open court, for which a less severe penalty originally was prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.380" offset="1814872">But it makes no sense to say that Congress did not intend statements made to law enforcement officers to be covered by Section 1001, on the assumption that they are less serious than perjury committed before a court of law, when it is common ground that Congress did intend Section 1001 to apply to false statements made to regulatory agencies, which frequently may be less serious than perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.199" offset="1910167">But indeed, we believe that the Court of Appeals and Respondent have severely understated the seriousness of making false statements to law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.820" offset="1944649">Not only may such statements divert finite governmental resources from bona fide investigations, but they bring to bear on the innocent subject of the false statement the full brunt of the government's investigative and prosecutorial capabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.767" offset="2008492">The Respondent and the Court of Appeals also worry that a ruling in favor of the government in this case would mean that false statements made in the context of judicial proceedings also would be punishable under Section 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.792" offset="2064603">As we noted in our brief, it does not necessarily follow from the fact that Section 1001 applies to false crime reports that it also applies to false statements made in the context of judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.552" offset="2111623">But in any event, there is no intrinsic reason why the government should not be permitted to prosecute false statements under either Section 1001 or the perjury statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.611" offset="2151852">The government frequently is permitted a choice of statutes under which it may proceed, and the consequences of such a choice to a defendant in this context will not be of great consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.185" offset="2194170">That is because 18 U.S.C. 1623, which was enacted in 1970, makes perjury committed before a court of law or a grand jury punishable to the same extent as are false statements under Section 1001 and eliminates the requirement that perjury be proved by two witnesses.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="534.302" stopTime="543.268">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="534.302" offset="2266582">Ms. Etkind, I understand your argument that there's no necessary inconsistency, but what is the government's position on whether 1001 applies to judicial proceedings?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_e_etkind" startTime="543.268" stopTime="848.270">
            <label>Ms. Barbara E. Etkind</label>
            <text syncTime="543.268" offset="2302422">Well, I think, I think that it probably would.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.046" offset="2329589">This Court held in Bramblett that 1001 applies to the legislative and judicial, as well as to the executive branch of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.308" offset="2370654">Respondents' and the Court of Appeals' final policy argument is that the construction we urge will have a chilling effect on the citizenry's willingness to report suspected criminal activity to law enforcement authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.755" offset="2428436">But the terms of the statute themselves preclude any undue chilling effect, since only false statements that are willfully and knowingly made are punishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.095" offset="2465739">There is therefore no liability simply because information reported in good faith turns out to be false.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.030" offset="2493534">Finally, in the alternative, Respondent argues that even if the Court agrees with our construction of the statute, that decision should not be applied in his case because at the time he made the false reports his conduct was not criminal under the law prevailing in the Eighth Circuit, that is, under the Friedman decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.177" offset="2586112">But there's no due process obstacles to applying a ruling in favor of the government to the Respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.923" offset="2617041">In the first place, because Section 1001 contains a willfullness requirement there's no danger that Respondent would be convicted in the absence of proof that he knew that the acts he committed were wrongful.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.575" offset="2667718">Accordingly, the question whether the existence of the Friedman precedent in the Eighth Circuit precludes Respondent's conviction is one for the finder of fact in the determination of willfulness in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.320" offset="2718709">But Respondent also appears to be making a larger argument based on notions of due process vagueness and notice, that the mere existence of a precedent in his circuit holding Section 1001 inapplicable to conduct analogous to his precludes his conviction as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.234" offset="2802301">But Respondent's argument would convert every arguable question of statutory construction into a constitutional vagueness issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.449" offset="2839186">Respondent has never argued that the words of Section 1001 themselves are so vague as to fail to give notice of the prohibited conduct, as in Connelly versus General Construction Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.038" offset="2889550">Nor is this a case like Bouie versus City of Columbia, on which Respondent does rely, because there the statute on its face gave no indication that it covered the defendant's conduct, nor had it ever been construed as covering such conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.907" offset="2949005">By contrast, Respondent's retroactivity argument assumes a ruling for the government on the substantive issue, and that ruling would be based on the fact that the plain language of the statute does cover his conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.901" offset="3008982">Respondent is thus reduced to arguing that whenever courts differ over the meaning of a statute the legislation is as a matter of law unconstitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.959" offset="3053285">But that cannot be.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.957" offset="3061227">If it were, the government would never be able to seek this court's review of an issue of statutory construction on which the courts of appeals were divided, because we would be asking for an advisory opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.546" offset="3107620">And likewise, this Court would be precluded from affirming a conviction in the face of a conflict among the circuits concerning the interpretation of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.699" offset="3140221">Yet the Court does so regularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.027" offset="3149521">Vagueness must rest on something more than a difference of opinion among courts and judges, and Respondent has alleged nothing more and there is nothing more in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.913" offset="3193093">Finally, application of a ruling in favor of the government to Respondent here is consistent with the opinion rendered in James versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.473" offset="3235307">In James, this Court held that embezzled funds are taxable income of the embezzler, thus overruling the prior decision in Wilcox versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.529" offset="3275535">James' conviction for willful evasion of taxes nevertheless was reversed because three Justices believed that the new construction should not be applied to him, while three other Justices would not have overruled Wilcox.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.508" offset="3331437">But, significantly, a total of five Justices were of the view that if a new rule were to be adopted it should be applied to James, at least absent a showing of bona fide reliance by him on the prior construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.424" offset="3391101">Indeed, even the view of the plurality in James is distinguishable from the present case, since James involved the overruling of a prior decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.654" offset="3432061">The willfullness requirement of Section 1001 assures that Respondent will not be convicted on the basis of conduct that he did not know was wrongful.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.478" offset="3475320">At least in the conduct of this case, due process requires no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.632" offset="3495904">The judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed and the case should be remanded for reinstatement of the indictment and trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="903.623" offset="3743859">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="907.591" offset="3759741">As Petitioners accurately stated, the issue in this case concerns statutory construction, that is, what meaning should we give to the word 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.991" offset="3825361">Petitioner raises several objections to the definition accorded that word by the Eighth Circuit in the Friedman and Rodgers cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.112" offset="3857857">As I understand her argument, she's saying that the definition that Friedman uses is overly technical, it undermines the purpose of the statute, and it's not required by the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.012" offset="3921491">I want to discuss those objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.244" offset="3934343">First with regard to the over-technicality of the definition that Friedman uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.055" offset="3965586">The definition that Petitioner wishes this Court to adopt is an extremely broad one.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.940" offset="4005188">I think she defines it in her brief as "power to exercise authority".</text>
            <text syncTime="974.578" offset="4027757">Leaving aside for the moment whether or not the Friedman definition is overly technical, I submit that Petitioner's alternative definition is hazy and overbroad and effectively takes away any meaning that the word "jurisdiction" can have in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.914" offset="4113021">She defines it, again, as "power to exercise authority".</text>
            <text syncTime="999.257" offset="4126396">But the Section 1001 contains a materiality requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.598" offset="4147816">Many cases that have discussed the statute, although not all, come to the conclusion that the materiality requirement inheres to the entire statute, and they define materiality as any statement that can have the capability of influencing an agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.760" offset="4248440">It is difficult to imagine a situation where a statement would be material... that is, having the capacity to influence an agency... and not be within the jurisdiction of that agency, as Petitioner defines it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.473" offset="4311343">I think if Petitioner's alternative definition is adopted by this Court, it is forcing this Court to assume that Congress intended absolutely nothing by the term 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.247" offset="4374350">I think this is a result that ought to be avoided at all costs, particularly in a carefully worded statute like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.946" offset="4409145">As to the general criticism that the definition of the court in the Eighth Circuit is overly technical, I fail to understand that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.848" offset="4460763">The definition used by the Friedman court fits well within a common, ordinary understanding of that word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.094" offset="4497752">Now, admittedly the word "jurisdiction" is a word of many meanings, many shades of meaning, but I think a common thread through much of the definitions of that word found in Webster's and in the case law that have used the word is some concept, some notion that there is a final decision somewhere, that the body that has the jurisdiction can make some act of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.489" offset="4611333">Perhaps not an act of finality for all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.816" offset="4624708">Certainly courts have jurisdiction, but they can be appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.940" offset="4637142">There's no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.454" offset="4643202">I don't think Friedman was talking about the final act; I think Friedman was talking about some positive power to make a disposition of the case before it, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="1154.850" offset="4748841">The FBI as I understand it has other duties other than merely investigating criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.236" offset="4786353">I think they also provide information to agencies regarding employee credentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.984" offset="4813312">That might be a situation where a statement given to the FBI might fall under the Act because the agency using that information would have the final say in whether or not the employee is hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.261" offset="4858451">And that is to be contrasted with the typical situation where the FBI investigates a criminal conduct and makes no decision as to whether or not a crime has been committed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert N. Moskowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="1218.809" offset="5004632">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.544" offset="5007558">It seems to us that Petitioner's definition requires an absurd result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.100" offset="5065759">It requires an assumption that Congress meant nothing by the word "jurisdiction".</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.582" offset="5087702">The Friedman interpretation is a good, common sense interpretation of the word, and the Court does not go far afield to find that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.483" offset="5131379">It's right there in Webster's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.952" offset="5137230">It's a commonly understood meaning of the word, and it has the beneficial side effect of according the word "jurisdiction" some meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.371" offset="5166905">Now, Petitioner also argues that it undermines the statute, and I guess within that argument is the assumption that there will be a gap in the law, people who do bad things will not be punished, that the purpose for which Section 1001 was passed will be undermined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.642" offset="5267947">And I challenge that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.046" offset="5281635">First, with regard to whether or not there's a gap in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.966" offset="5297308">To be sure, there will be a limited gap in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.589" offset="5319774">But I submit, first of all, that that gap is a lot narrower than has been suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.149" offset="5342030">First, there is another statute available to investigative agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.601" offset="5359793">5 U.S.C. Section 303 allows investigative agencies conducting certain kinds of investigations to administer an oath to a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.081" offset="5401694">Now, admittedly these investigations are confined to fraud or employee misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.155" offset="5433981">Nevertheless, that statute is available and it does bridge the gap somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.075" offset="5449654">Secondly, I maintain that whatever small gap is left in the law as a result of the Friedman decision is a beneficial one and should be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.853" offset="5492809">The purpose of Section 1001, as this Court has noted, was to protect the integrity of governmental agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.302" offset="5546621">It is an assumption that is not borne out by closer examination to say that the Friedman rule necessarily undermines agency duties, agencies like the FBI or the Secret Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.293" offset="5618614">First of all... and I think the Friedman court addressed this in a round-about way when it talked about the open line of communication that it is important to promote, rather than to chill, that is, the open line of communication between citizens and the law enforcement agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.678" offset="5688100">The Friedman result promotes that open line of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.487" offset="5707326">Petitioner's overbroad and, I submit, hazy definition of "jurisdiction" chills it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.313" offset="5730628">And I think it's clear which result will promote, rather than undermine, agency functioning like the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.779" offset="5764482">If it is assumed that the FBI's purpose is to gather information, any rule that would undermine that purpose would be in effect to go against what this Court saw in Section 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.163" offset="5822056">Secondly, an important aspect of an investigation is that period of time prior to the final trial or the final disposition when questions are being asked of witnesses, statements are being taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.156" offset="5894050">It is a common experience, certainly within my experience as an attorney who has had the obligation of investigating criminal allegations on behalf of my clients, to experience, particularly early on in an investigation, witnesses who are not totally truthful with me, witnesses who, because they are emotionally involved in the case or because they don't feel it's very important, they don't see the trial down the road, they don't realize they'll have to testify under oath, are not totally truthful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.204" offset="6046187">It is only later on, when it's clear that testimony will have to be given at a jury trial and perjury is a possibility, that I find witnesses will come forward and say, well, wait a minute, this is what I really meant to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.870" offset="6104910">I think Petitioner's rigid approach to this statute is going to have the effect of locking witnesses' statements in from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.273" offset="6142526">It's going to encourage them to stonewall it, it's going to result in a possibility of defective investigation and wrong investigation, rather than to promote the emergence of the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.015" offset="6205429">So I think it is wrong to assume that the Friedman result is necessarily an undermining of the investigative functioning of the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.542" offset="6255584">In fact, it may very well be that it promotes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.385" offset="6266974">Now, in the Petitioner's brief the legislative history is also discussed as being something that doesn't require the Friedman result, and there is some agreement here between us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.736" offset="6332384">There is agreement, first of all, that the legislative history on its face, sparse as it is, does not address itself to this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.232" offset="6382330">It is clear that what Congress was intending to do in 1934 in broadening the false statements statute was to reach, as one Senator said, all the buzzards, and I think what the Senator meant at that point was, he was talking about people who were giving false information to newly formed regulatory agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.769" offset="6476476">If Congress had envisioned the kind of situation, the kind of scope, the kind of reach that Petitioner attributes to this statute, then surely there would have been some discussion somewhere about the ramifications of such a broad, widely reaching statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.874" offset="6664871">Well, if they didn't think about it one way or the other, then your argument as to jurisdiction really depends on kind of just a parsing of the word itself, without necessarily any relation to what Congress had in mind.</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert N. Moskowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="1646.855" offset="6716802">Well, I think the lack of Congressional awareness of the claimed scope of the statute is not dispositive of the question, but it is instructive, and I think this Court has as recently as 1982, in the Williams versus United States case which I have cited, said as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.674" offset="6800081">And of course, in that case, a very similar case in many ways in that you were dealing with a false statements statute and you were asked to accept a rather technical definition of the word "statement" and the word "check", and this Court in so doing noted that one of the factors it considered was the lack of Congressional awareness of the scope of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.806" offset="6892659">Now, in this case I think the facts are stronger even than that for Respondent, because in this case Respondent is not asking this Court to place an unusually technical or abstract definition on "jurisdiction".</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.409" offset="6946993">It's a common sense one, it's an ordinary one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.627" offset="6955875">And it has the benefit not only of according some meaning to the word, but it does not undermine what Congress obviously was primarily concerned with in passing the 1934 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.012" offset="7009478">Now, it may be at some time in the future Congress will consider it necessary to protect investigative agencies with some carefully worded statute, the way many states have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.976" offset="7057334">But until that time, I think it would be improper to take the statute we have now, stretch it out of shape, and make it apply to this particular set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.254" offset="7098399">The Friedman rule has another side effect, another side benefit that's a very good one, and it was discussed a little bit in the briefs, but not in Petitioner's opening remarks, and that is the problem of the exculpatory no situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.506" offset="7227444">And that situation, of course, occurs most often in an investigative kind of situation, where an individual is being asked questions and he's then asked by the agent, did you do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.985" offset="7285331">And he says no, or he says something else in denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.124" offset="7305916">In effect, he's pleading not guilty to the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.012" offset="7317410">Does that situation fall under Section 1001?</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.370" offset="7342905">Well, that is a question that has been batted about by federal courts for several years now, and there's no conclusive answer to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.990" offset="7385328">It's a thorny issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.724" offset="7388254">The Friedman result, however, has the beneficial effect of for the most part avoiding that thorny issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.924" offset="7425139">The Friedman result then is something that is not only commonsensical, makes sense, but it has a side benefit of avoiding a thorny issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.418" offset="7479055">In conclusion with regard to this first issue, the Friedman result gives meaning to the word "jurisdiction", where Petitioner's definition does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.130" offset="7541958">It does so without going far afield to find that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.206" offset="7566200">It uses a reasonable, common sense one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.049" offset="7573619">It is consistent with and does not undermine the legislative history of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.827" offset="7608727">The primary purpose for which Congress intended to pass the statute is not frustrated by the Friedman result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.278" offset="7630461">Nor does the Friedman result undermine in any significant way the investigative functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.103" offset="7657837">In fact, it may even promote them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.791" offset="7664525">It preserves needed flexibility in the investigative stages of a criminal investigation, so that witnesses aren't locked into their first statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.643" offset="7715934">It preserves what the Lambert dissent from the Fifth Circuit noted as one of the most important of national policies, the open line of communication between individual citizens and investigative agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.575" offset="7779672">And, perhaps least important, it is consistent with the rule of lenity, a rule that still has some vitality, I take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.290" offset="7830559">And to the extent that rule need be applied in this case... and I'm not sure that it needs to be, because the definition that the Eighth Circuit uses is not an overly abstract one or an overly technical one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.690" offset="7884162">But to the extent that the Petitioner's overbroad definition is harsher than Friedman's, at least Friedman's result is consistent with that rule of lenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.107" offset="7925854">Now, as to the second issue which has been raised, about the retroactivity issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.636" offset="7959917">As I understand Petitioner's argument, there are two basic objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.352" offset="7978830">The second issue is the due process issue raised by Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.350" offset="8002758">The two objections, as I take it, are that the law is in the Eighth Circuit, when Mr. Rodgers was charged with this conduct, was not all that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.064" offset="8053645">Change was foreseeable, number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.249" offset="8062422">And number two, that there is no showing that the Defendant ever actually relied on the Friedman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.809" offset="8092619">I want to address those two objections, because I think they're unfounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.979" offset="8113308">First with regard to the law being unclear and changes foreseeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.915" offset="8133057">Well, change is always foreseeable in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.695" offset="8144133">The law never is static and never stands still.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.428" offset="8159075">But nevertheless, in the Eighth Circuit the law was clear as a bell when Rodgers acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.143" offset="8190004">Under the Friedman case, what Rodgers did was not against the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2108.184" offset="8562092">The decision couldn't have been clearer than it was, and I think the way the Rodgers case was handled in the district court and in the Court of Appeals indicated just how solid the Friedman rule still is in the Eighth Circuit and how clear it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.818" offset="8624681">The fact that other circuits may have come to different conclusions about the statute is fine for those other circuits, but Rodgers lives on the Eighth Circuit and this is the law in the Eighth Circuit and this is where he acted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2148.308" offset="8722588">It is, as I understand it, Petitioner's position that actual reliance is necessary here, and I think there's some confusion between the due process argument that's being made and the willfulness argument that was addressed in the James case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.582" offset="8791761">There is a willfulness requirement in this statute, but there is no argument here that the Defendant is not guilty of this offense, if it is an offense, because he wasn't willful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.122" offset="8849857">That's not the position of the Respondent, and therefore the James case is not germane to Respondent's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.432" offset="8887160">The case that is germane to Respondent's argument is the Bouie case, and the situation in the Bouie case is strong precedent and strong authority for Respondent's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.145" offset="8945988">In that case the defendants violated a trespass law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.924" offset="8973050">There was no showing whatsoever in that case on the record that I can tell indicating that the defendants in that case were personally aware of a narrow reading of the trespass statute involved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.996" offset="9025400">In fact, there's every indication to believe that they thought they were being arrested for a whole other crime, breach of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.882" offset="9060926">It was only subsequent to their arrest was the trespass charges brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.632" offset="9079943">Moreover, there's some indication that they wanted to be arrested, that they wanted to break the law to make a point totally unrelated to retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.269" offset="9114425">Rather than relying on some narrowly worded statute, it seems that the defendants in the Bouie case were relying on the fact that what they were doing was illegal in some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.794" offset="9164580">And this Court stated in a footnote, I think footnote 5, that subjective awareness of the criminal law is not relevant to a due process argument of fair warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.413" offset="9219019">What is relevant is the announcement of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.616" offset="9231872">That's what must be looked to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.912" offset="9249008">And what is the announcement of the law in this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="2294.031" offset="9305537">You simply, if you lose here, it would be a question of the Eighth Circuit being reversed by a court that's always had power to reverse the Eighth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2307.759" offset="9360394">A legal act, when done, would be made illegal retroactively, which this Court in the Bouie case found impossible, and I submit that the same result should be reached in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.267" offset="9426432">Certainly if the legislature had passed a statute reaching the activity of Rodgers one day after, there would be no question that that law could not be applied retroactively to Rodgers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.731" offset="9484319">The same result as this Court noted in Bouie should pertain to this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.103" offset="9509814">If the rule were otherwise, if actual knowledge of the statute or the law were required, it seems to me that we would have a situation where the due process guarantee would be applied to those who read their advance sheets and not applied to those who do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.705" offset="9584211">To the lawyer or the rich man who can afford a lawyer, he can take advantage of his due process rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2526.669" offset="10236123">Now, it is true that the courts have imputed a materiality requirement to all of the clauses of the statute, but I would suggest that probably is because of the requirement of</text>
