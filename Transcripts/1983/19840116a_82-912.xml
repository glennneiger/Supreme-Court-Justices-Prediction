            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="155506">We'll hear arguments next in Federal Communications Commission against League of Women Voters of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.018" offset="195526">Mr. Alito, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="76.041" offset="459571">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="79.614" offset="473886">This case concerns the constitutionality of 47 U.S.C. Section 399 which prohibits editorializing by those public television and radio stations that receive federal subsidies from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.464" offset="545357">This case is a direct appeal from a decision by the United States District Court for the Central District of California which invalidated Section 399.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.103" offset="591855">Appellees have raised a question about this Court's jurisdiction over the case, and the Court has postponed further consideration of the jurisdictional issue to the hearing on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.211" offset="636264">We have fully briefed the jurisdictional issue, and therefore, unless the Court has some questions on that matter, I will move directly to the merits of the case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="131.398" stopTime="148.687">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="131.398" offset="681090">I do have a question, actually, Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.000" offset="695405">Did you cite the Griggs decision of last term in connection with this, interpreting Rule 4(a)(4)?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="148.687" stopTime="208.758">
            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="148.687" offset="750157">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.140" offset="756009">That, of course, is one of the principal bases upon which Appellees rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.053" offset="775653">But of course, the appellate rules do not govern appeals to this Court, and there is a provision in 4(a)(4) which is noticeably absent from this Court's rules, and that provision says that a notice of appeal filed while certain post-trial motions are pending is a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.654" offset="846079">There is no such provision in this Court's rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.536" offset="857573">As I understand it, the rule prior to the 1980 amendment of the appellate rules which added that provision was that a notice of appeal filed under those circumstances would be valid, and therefore, I would believe that the absence of such a rule in this Court's rules means that our notice of appeal here is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.779" offset="930611">I would also point out that I think there is a question whether Rule 4(a)(4) applies to interlocutory appeals, even to the courts of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.834" offset="966765">But in any event, as I said, that rule does not apply to appeals to this Court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="208.758" stopTime="215.644">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="208.758" offset="990484">But certainly the Griggs result creates a trap for the unwary, doesn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="215.644" stopTime="385.175">
            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="215.644" offset="1018069">It creates a trap for the unwary, and when there is no provision in the governing rules pointing that trap out, it is all the more dangerous and unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.760" offset="1054536">There is nothing in this Court's rules that say that a notice of appeal filed while a motion for reconsideration is pending is a nullity, and I think that to reach that result in this case would frustrate the intent of Section 1252 under which we appealed, which of course is to allow a speedy and authoritative disposition of questions involving the constitutionality of acts of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.125" offset="1151921">If that had to wait while a collateral matter like attorneys' fees was decided, I think Congress' intent would be frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.751" offset="1186507">For example, here nearly a year went by while the attorneys' fees question was being decided by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.845" offset="1214824">Moving to the merits of the case, Section 399 has two separate provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.350" offset="1248887">The first provision which is directly attacked here today of course provides, as I said, that stations receiving federal funds from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting may not engage in editorializing.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.779" offset="1306566">In fact, every public television station at last count, and virtually every full service public radio station receives such funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.107" offset="1347839">The term editorializing has been authoritatively construed by the FCC, consistent with the legislative history, to mean only the official endorsement of views by station management, and therefore, Section 399 does not prohibit the discussion of any topic or the expression of any viewpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.790" offset="1426624">Station employees, journalists, commentators, public officials and everybody else can express their views on any subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.986" offset="1463405">The only thing that cannot be said is this editorial represents the position of station management, or something to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.421" offset="1493184">And of course, a station can say even that if only it is willing to give up federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.165" offset="1516068">If these funds are as insubstantial as Appellees and the district court suggest, then that should not represent a major sacrifice.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.911" offset="1551072">There is a second provision of 399 that is not directly challenged here today, but we believe it is nevertheless very much at issue, and that provision prohibits public stations from supporting or opposing candidates for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.519" offset="1613557">Now, Appellees originally challenged that provision as well and advanced almost the same arguments they now advance in this court in attacking the first provision of Section 399.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.477" offset="1661413">But they abandoned that appeal with Pacifica saying that at least for the present it has no intention of supporting or opposing candidates.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="385.175" stopTime="392.730">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="385.175" offset="1696104">Mr. Alito, you sat they abandoned that appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.148" offset="1708015">Do you mean they abandoned that prong of their attack in the district court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="392.730" stopTime="458.032">
            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="392.730" offset="1726406">Yes, I misspoke, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.942" offset="1739258">They amended their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.843" offset="1746781">But the argument that they have made in this Court that Section 399 can survive only if it is the most narrowly drawn statute designed to serve a compelling governmental interest would surely call for the invalidation of the second provision of Section 399 as well if it calls for the invalidation of the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.706" offset="1838314">And indeed, that argument is so broad that it calls into question virtually all of the special rules that apply to public stations as well as rules like the fairness doctrine that apply to all broadcasters.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.737" offset="1894425">Appellees play a kind of hide and seek game with this regulatory structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.680" offset="1914174">They deploy, as they said, a First Amendment argument that seems to require that most of it be swept away, yet at the same time they rely on these regulations, including the second provision of Section 399 to show that the provision on editorializing is unnecessary.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="458.032" stopTime="470.361">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="458.032" offset="1987630">Well, the standard which you attribute to Appellee as the narrowest possibly tailored is really the standard that applies to the government as regulator, isn't it, not to the government as expending public funds.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="470.361" stopTime="474.222">
            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="470.361" offset="2036949">I'm not sure I understand your question, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="474.222" stopTime="495.316">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="474.222" offset="2052309">Well, we have held, for instance, in cases like Regan v. Taxation with Representation, United States Postal Service v. Greenberg and cases like that that where the government isn't acting as lawgiver in the sense of regulating private individuals, but instead, deciding how it is going to put its property to use or how it is going to spend its money, the standards are a good deal more lenient.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="495.316" stopTime="510.936">
            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="495.316" offset="2136737">It certainly is, and that is our second argument in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.159" offset="2152097">Section 399 does not prohibit a public station from editorializing.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.182" offset="2172159">It simply says that if it wants to do so, it can't receive funds from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="510.936" stopTime="513.879">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="510.936" offset="2199222">Did the government make that spending power argument below?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="513.879" stopTime="544.199">
            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="513.879" offset="2210925">We did not couch it in those terms, but we certainly pointed out and relied upon the fact of government funding, and the district court addressed that question, and I don't really think that the spending power raises a different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.228" offset="2272365">It's just an aspect of the same larger question, whether Section 399 violates the First Amendment, and I think that is the same question whether the affirmative basis for Congress' action is the spending power or the commerce power.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="544.199" stopTime="556.916">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="544.199" offset="2332237">But if you say that, you can't also be arguing, well, all they have to do is give up the money, and they can... because your argument really would extend a blanket prohibition against editorializing by public stations.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="556.916" stopTime="585.086">
            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="556.916" offset="2383124">We are making two arguments, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.407" offset="2393050">We believe that Section 399 was constitutional as originally enacted in 1967, and we believe it is all the more constitutional as amended in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.094" offset="2439862">In fact, I think the effect of the amendment in practical terms was very slight since substantially all stations receive these funds, and it was Congress' belief in 1967 that they would receive those funds.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="585.086" stopTime="591.070">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="585.086" offset="2495764">I think your basic argument would really apply not merely to public television but to all licensed television, wouldn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="591.070" stopTime="619.647">
            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="591.070" offset="2519692">No, not at all, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.471" offset="2529305">Nothing in our submission has any implications for commercial broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.373" offset="2544979">The heart of our argument is that public broadcasting is very different in many ways from commercial broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.866" offset="2574967">It was created for a different purpose, and it is dominated by government entanglements that have no parallel whatsoever in the world of public broadcast... of commercial broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.675" offset="2622197">And it is that which supports the constitutionality.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="619.647" stopTime="629.755">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="619.647" offset="2634004">Well, there is this parallel, that in both areas the government has the power to say you cannot continue to broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.280" offset="2656574">I mean, because even in the private sector they have the licensing power.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="629.755" stopTime="711.828">
            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="629.755" offset="2674442">Well, that is certainly true, and the government has considerable power over all broadcasting that it doesn't possess with respect to the print media.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.160" offset="2708087">I think this Court's cases have recognized that the government's power with respect to all broadcasting permits restrictions on the right to editorialize.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.286" offset="2752600">The right to editorialize is also the right not to editorialize, as the Court said in Miami Herald Company v. Tornillo, but commercial broadcasters are encouraged to editorialize, and they have to give up time for reply under certain circumstances when they make an attack on an individual or a group or they support or oppose a candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.272" offset="2844551">That is a restriction on editorializing that would not be tolerated in the print media.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.735" offset="2866389">The question here is whether a further restriction on editorializing that Section 399 puts into effect is justified by the special characteristics of public broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.053" offset="2919679">Let me turn to those special characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.896" offset="2939010">First of all, there is the matter of funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.349" offset="2952802">Sixty-seven percent of the income of public radio comes from direct government subsidies, and approximately 60 percent of the income of public television--</text>

            <text syncTime="737.894" offset="3107029">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="742.118" offset="3123957">Before lunch I was beginning to talk about the enormous differences between public broadcasting which is involved here, and the commercial sphere of the industry, with which this Court is perhaps more familiar due to its prior decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.448" offset="3181217">Appellee has tried to... the Appellees have tried to suggest in this case that public stations are generally just like commercial stations: they are free to do and say whatever they want with the sole exception of the ill-motivated restriction contained in Section 399, and that is simply not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.290" offset="3264600">Public stations are subject to many special restrictions designed to ensure that they remain true to their intended purpose and fulfill their public mission.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.586" offset="3305769">For example, they may not be profit-making institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.288" offset="3316636">They can only be licensed to units of government and non-profit groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.511" offset="3337534">They may not sell air time even for political or public affairs programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.117" offset="3359895">They may not accept advertising, even political advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.637" offset="3374001">They have... they are subject to special equal employment opportunity rules, special accounting rules, special open meeting requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.492" offset="3409423">They have to have community advisory boards to review their programming and see if they are serving the needs of the entire community.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.109" offset="3439934">Now, before lunch, before lunch I started to talk about the matter of funding, and of course, that is critical here.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.474" offset="3473370">I pointed out that fully 60 percent of the income of public broadcasting comes from direct government grants, and that is really only the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.452" offset="3513286">Virtually every public television station facility in this country was built with substantial federal funds, and many of public broadcasting's most popular shows, such as Sesame Street, are financed with federal dollars and are supplied to these stations at no cost or less than cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.443" offset="3597191">And then, of course, there are the huge tax subsidies that these stations receive by virtue of their tax-exempt status.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.719" offset="3626344">Appellees have attempted to disparage the significance of the federal contribution to public stations, but on this point I think I will let the Corporation for Public Broadcasting speak for itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1318.095" offset="5427852">I think that that is artificial economics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.055" offset="5435689">Federal support assists every aspect of station operations, and as the sentence I read from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting report indicates, in many instances it is absolutely vital for the continued existence of public stations in their present form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.202" offset="5524296">Therefore, if there were no such support, in many cases there would be no antenna, there would be no studio, there would be no employees, and it would not really make very much difference if the station could draw from private funds, the small, direct incremental amount necessary to broadcast the editorial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.944" offset="5611232">If funded public stations were permitted to editorialize, given the nature of funding for public broadcasting, the federal government would necessarily be subsidizing that editorializing, and that is one of the chief things that Congress sought to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.436" offset="5681240">Now, Appellees' argument is that Section 399 is unconstitutional because it attaches an unconstitutional condition to the receipt of federal money, and they rely on cases like Speiser v. Randall and Perry v. Sindermann, and Sherbert v. Verner, but those cases I think are clearly distinguishable from this one on at least three major grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.890" offset="5774967">First of all, this Section 399 is not in any way content-related.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.754" offset="5798477">It does not prevent anybody from expressing any view or discussing any topic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.451" offset="5829302">An argument very similar to Appellees' was made to this Court in FCC v. National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting in which the Court considered the constitutionality of regulations that prohibited newspapers from getting broadcast licenses in the same market, and the Court unanimously rejected on the ground that the regulations there were not content-related.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.156" offset="5924074">And that distinguished Speiser in that line of authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1494.570" offset="6133785">The Speiser line of authority is distinguishable in any event, I think, on two other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.954" offset="6159281">First of all, Section 399, as I said, prevents the use of federal money to subsidize editorializing, given the nature of the funding that public broadcasting receives, and in Speiser and those other cases there was no real question of subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.216" offset="6224273">In Speiser, for example, taxpayers were denied a property tax exemption that was given to honorably discharged veterans, and they were denied that on the ground that they refused to sign a loyalty oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.434" offset="6277145">Well, you certainly couldn't say that the property tax exemption, if it had been given, would be subsidizing their refusal to sign the loyalty oath, and I think that is true of the other cases upon which Appellees have relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.343" offset="6332838">And finally, the restriction here is closely related to the purposes for Congress' funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.867" offset="6358961">It is not simply an extraneous limitation that is tacked on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.529" offset="6377560">It helps to ensure that public broadcasting remains true to its intended purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2033.935" offset="8291186">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.206" offset="8308322">At issue in this case is a statute that very straightforwardly and unabashedly suppresses speech of the highest order in our constitutional framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.835" offset="8350745">If this statute were directed at the Washington Post or presumably even at CBS TV instead of at Pacifica Foundation, there would be no doubt of its unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.872" offset="8394944">Indeed, in Mills v. Alabama, this Court said with respect to a similar ban on editorials that it was difficult to conceive of a more obvious and flagrant violation of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.019" offset="8435486">Yet here the government is saying that the same ban on editorializing can constitutionally be applied against Pacifica and other noncommercial broadcasters.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2079.313" stopTime="2098.948">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2079.313" offset="8472685">Do you mean by that that the City of New York or the City of Chicago can own and control a public station and let the mayor of the town have special rights for broadcasting and have his views advocated over opposing views?</text>

            <text syncTime="2098.948" offset="8551261">As long as there is fairness is assured, which is assured by the fairness doctrine, yes, that would be no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.079" offset="8571741">In fact, it would raise very substantial federalism issues if the federal government were permitted to suppress the viewpoints of the state or local governmental entities, particularly if their speech was directed at a federally related issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.709" offset="8622314">Now, in order to justify this distinction between this ban and those bans which would not be constitutional if applied in other contexts, the government jumps between two separate rationales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.387" offset="8676962">They rely upon the presence of a government subsidy, and they also rely upon the scarcity rationale and the scarcity of broadcast frequencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.723" offset="8706324">But neither of these rationales, whether alone or in combination, can support their result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.597" offset="8729834">For the notion that the government can use its federal funds and its federal subsidy as a justification for imposing a restriction on the use of private funds has never been accepted by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2184.213" offset="8892316">The way we are allotting the money isn't doing any good.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.574" offset="8901720">So then the government says let's make it mean something.</text>

            <text syncTime="3692.601" offset="14925870">What they are saying, the essence of what they are saying they can do is prescribe institutional neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.758" offset="14958471">They concede that it might be a different case if they were prohibiting one view or another, but they think that they can prescribe institutional neutrality on the theory that expressions of the institution's viewpoints are somehow incompatible with the intended mission in society of that institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.418" offset="15025135">I believe that that truly has alarming implications in this day and age where it is no longer the case that the single individual's voice can effectively provide a counterweight to government action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.036" offset="15075604">It is increasingly the case that people have to rely on groups of individuals, on institutions, on educational institutions, on state and local governments to provide a voice in contrast to that of the federal government, and if the federal government through the coercive use of its funding which, as I say, is more and more pervasive, can require those institutions to give up the right to speak, even if it is not directed at a specific viewpoint, it would mean that there would be no effective voices left to counteract the government's voice if and when such a counteracting voice is needed.</text>
