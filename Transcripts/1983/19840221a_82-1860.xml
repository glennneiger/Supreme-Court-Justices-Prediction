            <text syncTime="61.398" offset="390466">Schneider and Prosser are two independent moving companies located in St. Louis, Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.817" offset="416171">Over a number of years, they entered into a series of collective bargaining agreements with a teamster's local in St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.330" offset="446159">In accordance with these agreements, they agreed that they would make contributions to the respondent trustee funds on behalf of regular employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.325" offset="490149">The labor agreements further provided that contributions would not be made on behalf of non-regular employees, who are variously referred to in the agreements as part-time, extras, casuals, temporary, and seasonals.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.975" offset="552739">I would like to emphasize at the outset that this particular dispute arises out of the terms of the collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.548" offset="603103">It does not involve the interpretation or construction of statutory rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.015" offset="624941">In the collective bargaining agreements, Schneider and Prosser and the unions expressly reserved to themselves the right to resolve differences regarding the meaning or application of the agreements through the grievance and arbitration procedure in the contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.763" offset="1403913">If you were correct in your position that there is some duty to arbitrate, does the union have a right if it got into a dispute with the employer about what employees were covered and what contributions had to be made, does the union have the right to waive the payment of some of those moneys, to enter into an agreement some way during the course of the collective bargaining period, saying, well, we understand there is a dispute, we will just give up the right to the payment of some particular moneys?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="368.024" offset="1616967">Is there any authority for that?</text>
            <text syncTime="368.883" offset="1620415">I mean, what do you rely on?</text>

            <text syncTime="370.460" offset="1626685">I am relying on their status as the statutory exclusive bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.084" offset="1645179">When the collective bargaining agreement is first negotiated, the union at that time is doing precisely what you are addressing now.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.331" offset="1678198">The union at that time is deciding with the employer through collective bargaining how to divide the employer's financial pot.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.061" offset="1713098">In this case, for example, it was agreed that the employer would make contributions to the funds on behalf of only regular employees, and not on behalf of other non-regular employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.367" offset="1770358">So, at that point the union is in effect saying, we are waiving, if you may, our claim that the employer should make contributions on behalf of--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="416.770" offset="1811945">Well, they obviously have the right to enter into the collective bargaining agreement in the first instance.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="421.846" offset="1832216">But really the question is then, is that fixed, so to speak, because of the interplay with ERISA, and so the union can't tinker around with it after that, or waive some portion of the claim, or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.886" offset="1900448">I believe that there are some distinctions that could be made, and the clearest distinction would be between vested pension benefits of employees which cannot be tinkered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.600" offset="1943289">I think ERISA is fairly clear there, that if the union or the employer attempt to tinker with vested pension benefits, then I think they are interfering with ERISA's statutory rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.565" offset="1991145">But here we are not talking about employee benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.189" offset="2005669">We are talking about the funding obligation, what is the measure of the employer's obligation to make contributions to the fund?</text>
            <text syncTime="472.437" offset="2034613">The determination of employee benefits is reserved exclusively to the trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.918" offset="2060526">That is up to them to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.855" offset="2068259">Here, the employer and the union thought they had a fixed agreement as to what the measure of the funding obligation would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.539" offset="2098979">During the course of their history, the issue never arose as to whether the employer was complying with that until the trustees conducted an audit.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.488" offset="2134819">They believed that contributions were due on behalf of employees who the employer thought were non-regular employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.282" offset="2174002">That has raised the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.921" offset="2180585">It is our position that that goes to the very heart of the bargain between the employer and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.090" offset="2205245">The employer and the union reserved the right to resolve those differences between themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.994" offset="2228859">Once those issues are resolved, then the trustees have a right to contribute whatever the fixed obligation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.334" offset="2270237">We are not arguing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.989" offset="2280791">Mr. Yates, is it not possible that in some situations, at least, that the question of coverage would be identical to the question of contribution?</text>
            <text syncTime="542.064" offset="2313078">In other words, if the particular temporary employee is covered, it may be in time the trustees would have to decide whether his rights are vested or not.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="552.061" offset="2353098">And if they decided there was vesting there, they then would... you still say they would not have the right to say, well, therefore there must be contributions made on behalf of... on account of that employee.</text>

            <label>Mr. David F. Yates</label>
            <text syncTime="562.790" offset="2396043">I believe that once again there is a distinction between the funding obligation and the determination of employee benefits, and I believe it is within the discretion of the trustees to say that they will continue to provide benefits for an employee even if the union and the employer agree that contributions will not be made for that employee, just as in Kaiser the measure of the funding obligation was the number of tons of non-union coal produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.529" offset="2498966">It is simply a measure of... upon the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.575" offset="2511191">So you could end up with a situation in which the union and the company would agree that we don't have to make contributions on behalf of Employees A, B, and C, but yet the trustees might be convinced they had a duty to pay pensions to those employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="605.585" offset="2567197">Now, it's very likely that the pension fund or the health and welfare fund might say, we will not permit participation on that basis, and that is within their right, too.</text>

            <text syncTime="743.857" offset="3120262">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the rule of the Eighth Circuit has adopted a position of a presumption against arbitration, and allows the trustees to independently sue the employer and litigation the meaning and the intent of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.491" offset="3194868">Further, it is to the exclusion of the union, and will not be binding on the union nor its membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.582" offset="3227155">The effects on the typical labor management relationships as a result of this rule seem obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.374" offset="3262368">First of all, it violates the intents of the parties to the collective bargaining agreement, the union and the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.887" offset="3288386">Secondly, it invades the traditional province of the union and the employer to collectively bargain and settle their disputes as to what the meaning of that collective bargaining agreement is.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.461" offset="3330704">Third, it subjects the employer to inconsistent obligations, and possibly very heavy expenses for having to litigate this particular issue in a multiplicity of forums, and last but not least, it serves a disservice to the judiciary by forcing the courts to hear traditional labor disputes which are well suited for an arbitrator to decide, and which additionally are neither binding on the co-signatories to the collective bargaining agreement, the union in this particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="827.558" offset="3455047">Mr. Bobinette, in these particular cases, it appeared that both the collective bargaining agreement and the trust indenture referred to a right of the trustees to file suit for purposes of enforcing the collection proceedings and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.112" offset="3549297">That is a little different than if the agreements had provided, perhaps, that arbitration was required, and they are silent on that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles W. Bobinette</label>
            <text syncTime="864.793" offset="3604050">Well, it comes down to a question of determining what the intents of the parties are.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.884" offset="3624425">If you look at the collective bargaining agreement as the wishes and the desires of the settlers to the trust, you look at the intents of the settlers in establishing that particular trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.584" offset="3663191">What were the intents of the union and the employer at the time they entered into the collective bargaining agreement?</text>
            <text syncTime="885.613" offset="3687328">It has been some bother, particularly to the Eighth Circuit, that the trustees have no direct access to the arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.703" offset="3727661">That is, they can not flip it on and then proceed into arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.699" offset="3743648">I would suggest the fact that they are specifically not mentioned as parties who can trigger the arbitration provision is an indication that the parties, the union and the employer, never intended to allow them to involve themselves in interpretive disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.303" offset="3810104">Given that, and then comparing it to the language contained within the trust indentures, the language in the trust indentures I believe presupposes that the debt or the obligation under the collective bargaining agreement is already established, and that really what is being allowed under the trust indenture is the right to collect delinquencies, and nothing more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.652" offset="3907488">And for that reason, I would suggest that that is reasonable to determine, that it was the intent of the parties to the collective bargaining agreement to resolve all interpretive disputes under the... or through the grievance and the arbitration provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.535" offset="3983034">These risks that I have mentioned are neither mandated nor warranted by the legislative history, nor by the language or the structure of those federal statutes dealing with the regulation of employee benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1419.818" offset="5824144">The basis on which the Eighth Circuit has made its decision, this is an interpretation of the intent of Congress to not... to separate the trustees from the dependents of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.762" offset="5919962">This is drawn from 302(c)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.698" offset="5931664">A review of the history, of the legislative history indicates the concerns of Congress were with bribery and extortion and illegal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.319" offset="5970117">To the contrary, the Eighth Circuit was concerned with the idea that the union in good faith would not decide to otherwise arbitrate a meritorious dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.737" offset="6015779">I don't think that the concerns of Congress were the same concerns that the Eighth Circuit had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.577" offset="6043155">Specfically, I think the construction is supported by looking at the text of Section 302(c)(5) and indicating that there is nothing in the conditions for setting up these trusts which in any way indicates that Congress intended to alter the relationship between the union and the employer in terms of settling its own disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.381" offset="6126433">Most recently, in 1980, Congress adopted the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act specifically under Section 515, and under that section it allows the trustees to institute suit for delinquent contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.889" offset="6204383">We have submitted that these underlying contract disputes are not the kind of delinquency actions that Congress had in mind, nor are they simple collection actions that was discussed in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.774" offset="6259971">Arbitration is integrally related to determining the extent of the promise provided for in the collective bargaining agreement, and therefore they are defenses which are in fact very much related to the question of the obligation of the employer to pay benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.643" offset="6323397">Lastly, the question that has to come up in a person's mind is whether or not Congress intended to allow trustees to involve itself in interpretive disputes under Section 515 of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.464" offset="6390688">Given the fact that under this section it is mandatory that a judge impose penalties, damages, double interest payments, as well as attorneys' fees, and given the fact that Congress never addressed the question of whether or not trustees can involve themselves in interpretive disputes, it raises a serious question as to whether or not Congress intended employers to suffer the penalties provided for under this section if they in good faith involved themselves in interpretive dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.007" offset="6576889">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the respondent's Central States Pension Fund is the largest Taft-Hartley multiemployer fund in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.769" offset="6627984">It has approximately half a million participants and beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.782" offset="6643971">It has over 12,000 contributing employers spread out over 40 states, and it distributes hundreds of millions of dollars to retirees and their dependents in the form of benefit payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.307" offset="6698097">I think it is important for the Court to understand that who the responsibilities are... what the responsibilities are of the respondents in its relation to... as compared to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.928" offset="6744595">The trustees are charged under the statute, under ERISA, to represent in a fiduciary capacity retirees, of which we have approximately 116,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.672" offset="6803527">Also in our constituency we have active union participants and non-active union participants, the state right to workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.605" offset="6839263">We also have beneficiaries of the retirees and the participants which includes their spouses and their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.992" offset="6868833">Now, under ERISA, as we perceive the statute, they are our responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.973" offset="6904778">We have an unwavering, uncompromising duty to protect their interests within the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.361" offset="6938319">What the petitioners seek here is the imposition of compulsory arbitration upon the respondent's board of trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.420" offset="6982518">They seek this notwithstanding the fact that the trustees have not agreed to the imposition of arbitration, notwithstanding the fact that the trustees have no access to nor can they participate in the arbitration process that is submitted by the petitioners, and notwithstanding the fact that ERISA, enacted in 1975, specifically provides, pursuant to MEPA, as it was revised in 1980, that the trustees may sue under a federal specific cause of action, Section 515, which Congress gave us under MEPA, that Congress provided for us a specific forum under ERISA, that they provided for us federal mandatory remedies in delinquent contribution cases where we are successful that are mandatory, including attorney fees and statutory liquidated damages, and nowhere, Your Honors, in the statute or the legislative history is there any mention about Congress intending at any point to insert arbitration as a condition precedent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2167.657" offset="8815478">It is 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.875" offset="8820389">And not until 1974 has the exhaustion doctrine gained any prominence at all in the federal system, and in that case, Days Electric, decide in 1974 in the Middle District of Florida, the judge there characterized the decision of this Court in Louis v. Benedict as one that this Court ruled in that case, the ruling in that case about unions not being able... or employers not being able to set off against trustees for the transgressions of unions, he said that that was a matter of substantive law, and that to require trustees under a Taft-Hartley collection action to defer to the arbitration process was a rule of procedure, and it did not subvert their rights at all to switch them from court into that forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.650" offset="9027488">That case was picked up... I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.383" offset="9038355">That's not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.148" offset="9041490">That case was followed by a District Court in the Howard Martin case in Indiana Federal Court, and it was affirmed by the Seventh Circuit in Howard Martin, and it is interesting to point out in that case that the Seventh Circuit suggested that the trustees' argument that they didn't have access to the tribunal fell of its own weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.904" offset="9148487">Merely ask the union to file the grievance, the party of primary interest, and that will resolve the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.181" offset="9181611">The problem is that we did that, and there was no arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.429" offset="9210554">It was not done, and the Howard Martin Company went into bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.334" offset="9226228">I think that one of the main problems that we see is the fact that in our constituency we represent retirees as well as active union participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.969" offset="9276696">To delegate a basic core fiduciary duty of collecting contributions which is, after all the life's blood of any pension or health and welfare fund, we have to collect the money, and we think that asking the union to handle that phase of our collection work is... creates a problem, because we think that the unions, not for sinister reasons, but for legitimate reasons, often have a dilemma or problems of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.174" offset="9409607">We think that there are basic built-in conflicts of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.813" offset="9424131">For example, the retirees that we represent the union owes no duty of fair representation to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.512" offset="9458926">Typically what can happen is that the fund will do an audit with its auditors of a company and turn up evidence that employees maybe four or five years ago were not reported properly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2435.142" offset="9885454">As a matter of fact, the petitioners in their collective bargaining agreements agreed in the pension and health and welfare articles which are cited in the appendix to allow the parties who founded the trust to appoint trustees and to be bound by the trust agreement that is put together by the trustees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2490.477" offset="10106763">The union has its own rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.430" offset="10114600">We think that's fairly clear, and relating to the trilogy and Justice White's opinion in Atkinson versus Sinclair, it is still a matter of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.833" offset="10160157">As to the Congressional intent that petitioners alluded to about Congress and arbitration, Congress is no stranger to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.624" offset="10199341">When it has addressed, it has spoken directly about it, for example, in the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.404" offset="10226508">In the Railway Labor Act, it is set forth in our brief, in the Northwest Airlines case, arbitration is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.979" offset="10256811">It is mandatory under 302(c)(5)(D), deadlock situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.742" offset="10275828">Congress said arbitration is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.959" offset="10284709">They said that it is required under the Withdrawal Liability Act of ERISA, but even there Congress said that the arbitrator in that situation is not to act like the typical arbitrator in the collective bargaining sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.609" offset="10359315">He is to serve more of a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.936" offset="10364644">You are either right or your're wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.093" offset="10369242">And finally, the desirability of private agreements under 209(d) of Taft-Hartley, which is Congress's expression, says it is the desire, it is the preferred policy, and as this Court has developed through the Steelworkers Trilogy and the Atkinson case, that is the preference, and arbitration is a wonderful thing where the parties have agreed to it and it serves a great purpose in this nation under the labor law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3036.227" offset="12289764">Another aspect of the case, and there are really two issues, in a sense, although they are interrelated, and that is in the Prosser case, where Prosser has indicated that audits, the scope of an audit is also subject to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.653" offset="12415465">Our trust agreement... in other words, when we went in to perform an audit on Prosser, they said, wait a minute, you know, you can't audit, because the scope of your audit is also arbitrable, and that... and I wanted to bring that to the Court's attention, that in the trust agreement we have two provisions that address that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.158" offset="12521522">One is production of pertinent records, and also the trustees' power to construe the trust agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.981" offset="12548794">Basically, the Central States' funds with half a million people, 12,000 employers over 40 states, some people are surprised when we say this, but the fact of the matter is that we have an honor system of reporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.101" offset="12609294">There is no other practical way for us to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.756" offset="12619847">Monthly the employers fill out a report form and send us a check, and so it is based on an honor system, and the only checks and balances we have, we perform random audits, and we do that through our audit department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.421" offset="12690587">We also know that, under ERISA and also under Department of Labor advisory opinions that have been issued, that the funds must provide coverage and grant pension credits regardless of whether or not the employer makes contributions if he was obligated in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.882" offset="12764357">We look upon audits as a matter of pure trust administration, and subject only to a federal court's review as to whether or not the scope of our audit was arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.924" offset="12820572">Since we have literally thousands of employers and thousands of collective bargaining agreements that range in grievance resolving mechanisms from one arbitrator to a panel of three to joint committees, that it would be absolutely chaotic for a centralized fund of our size to be bound by an arbitrator's decision in Iowa that you have a right to audit for three years, someone in Indiana for one year, the joint committee says five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.783" offset="12971978">We think that that is particularly a matter of pure trust administration, and that the scope of our audits are really something that should be subject to a court's review as to arbitrary and capricious scope of conduct of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.668" offset="13039583">In concluding... I see the light is on... I would say this, that the entire statutory scheme of ERISA is to, Number One, to safeguard the assets for retirees and their dependents, and it is to make sure that there is accountability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.548" offset="13135086">We think that the petitioner's position allows for a dilution of the fixing of that responsibility by requiring us to rely on the union who is not our agent under Amex Coal, whom we cannot tell what to do, who itself may have for legitimate reasons a conflict of interest as to the constituents that we represent as opposed to the ones that they represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.677" offset="13247622">We think that that together with the statutory history makes it clear that the responsibility to collect money that we are entitled to under a collective bargaining agreement is strictly with the trustees, and that any dilution or any rule of law that starts to split that responsibility is not in the best interest of the participants and beneficiaries, and contrary to Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.400" offset="13370502">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="3329.937" offset="13464647">When the union and the employer sit down in collective bargaining negotiations, they at that time in this case negotiated the funding obligation of the employer to the trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.167" offset="13513548">They limited that funding obligation to less than all employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.664" offset="13539566">At that time they were in fact acting to a certain extent as agent of the trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.692" offset="13567674">They were negotiating what the obligation would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.689" offset="13587632">What the respondents are suggesting here would result in the, as Justice Rehnquist suggested, the trust becoming the tail that wags the dog here.</text>
