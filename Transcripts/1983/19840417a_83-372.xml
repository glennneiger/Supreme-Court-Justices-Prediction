            <text syncTime="63.972" offset="406566">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="68.908" offset="426315">We are here today because the Ninth Circuit has created an anomaly.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.717" offset="445541">It has allowed one California taxing agency to garnish property held by the Postal Service on behalf of a third party, but has prohibited another state taxing agency from using a similar garnishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.745" offset="505727">This is even though both agencies use analogous tax collection procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.696" offset="529551">In addition, seven circuits have found, and the Postal Service concedes, that garnishment by ordinary judgment creditors should be honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.783" offset="569884">It must be emphasized that none of these garnishments were on property belonging to the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.795" offset="597887">The garnishments were on property held by the Postal Service as a mere stakeholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.214" offset="623591">The issue in this case, then, is whether the Ninth Circuit should have allowed the Franchise Tax Board to garnish the wages of Postal Service employees who did not pay their California income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.977" offset="674582">California submits that there are two controlling propositions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.850" offset="698093">The first is that the sovereign immunity of the Postal Service has been waived, at least to the extent that it must honor a garnishment for delinquent taxes on wages of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.061" offset="750964">The second proposition is that the Ninth Circuit erred when it found that an unrelated federal statute dealing only with wage withholding preempted the Franchise Tax Board statute and garnishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.994" offset="806657">This case arose because various Postal Service employees did not pay their California income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.724" offset="833616">These taxes are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.505" offset="844692">They were either self-assessed or became final by assessment of the Franchise Tax Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.489" offset="864649">In order to collect these taxes, the Franchise Tax Board attempted to garnish the wages of these employees, but the Postal Service refused to honor the garnishment.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="188.779" offset="905818">Ms. Kitching, is that the standard procedure in California whereby the state collects delinquent taxes?</text>
            <text syncTime="196.309" offset="935911">It doesn't go to court to get a garnishment, but it just kind of has an assessment like the IRS?</text>

            <text syncTime="203.086" offset="963079">Our statutes are very similar to those of the IRS.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.644" offset="1021279">As I will discuss a little later in more detail, before our tax assessment becomes final, the taxpayer is given a multitude of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.295" offset="1059941">The taxpayer can go through several levels of administrative review before the taxpayer has to pay the tax and before it comes final.</text>

            <text syncTime="587.992" offset="2502736">California's remedies are cumulative, just as the remedies of the Internal Revenue Service are cumulative.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.940" offset="2530530">It... it is important to have a prompt and efficient collection of tax, and this is a very efficient way to collect tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.953" offset="2562504">And we... we have other remedies, but we should be allowed to use all of our remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.093" offset="2583088">The Internal Revenue Service can use all of their remedies, and we should be able to use all of ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.137" offset="2599284">And sometimes taxpayers don't have other property that we can file liens against, but perhaps they're employed and we can levy on their wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.151" offset="2639304">So there are reasons when this would be the only way we could collect the tax--</text>
            <text syncTime="625.337" offset="2652052">As I mentioned, there was a companion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.475" offset="2668666">The Employment Development Department also filed a lawsuit because its garnishment was not honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.097" offset="2691131">They are responsible for collecting employment taxes, and their procedures are similar to those of the Franchise Tax Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.501" offset="2724777">The cases were consolidated, and the district court found for the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.465" offset="2744630">On appeal the cases were also consolidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.132" offset="2755288">As I said with regard to the appeal of the Employment Development Department, the Ninth Circuit found that the garnishment should be honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.694" offset="2785485">They found that the sue and be sued clause had waived the sovereign immunity of the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.771" offset="2805756">Also as I said, the Ninth Circuit found, however, that our garnishment was preempted under the facts of this case and because we had signed the agreement with the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.420" offset="2848388">In essence the Ninth Circuit decided that a statute, 5 U.S.C. Section 5517, which was enacted to help the states collect their revenue from all federal employees, should be interpreted to prohibit the State of California from garnishing the salary of Postal Service employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.334" offset="2932084">The dissenting judge found that the Franchise Tax Board's garnishment should be honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.424" offset="2952460">She found no reason to believe that Congress would treat tax... tax debts any differently than it would treat other debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.499" offset="2984747">In fact, she concluded that the application of the California collection procedures was the only result which would further Congress' intent to treat the Postal Service as a private employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="912.494" offset="3800708">We feel that the Burr case is controlling and is authority for our position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.728" offset="3821606">Comparable to the decision in Burr, the Franchise Tax Board is simply treating the Postal Service as a stakeholder and requiring it to turn over money otherwise payable to its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.237" offset="3871657">We do not become involved with Postal Service functions or property--</text>
            <text syncTime="934.530" offset="3888793">Recognizing that the Postal Service is a mere stakeholder in this case, a decision for the Franchise Tax Board cannot be relied upon by other administrative agencies to burden the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.529" offset="3936858">Furthermore, if a decision sustaining the Franchise Tax Board is going to create the administrative burden that's portrayed by the Postal Service, then why wasn't the comparable and adverse Employment Development Department decision appealed from the Ninth Circuit?</text>
            <text syncTime="962.598" offset="4001119">Even though the Postal Service is simply a stakeholder, it alleges that California's income tax garnishment should not be honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.565" offset="4032989">It argues that the sue and be sued clause only waives Postal Service immunity with regard to judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.905" offset="4062351">This argument does not recognize, however, the similarity of tax assessment procedures to judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.777" offset="4093802">As I stated, it was not necessary for California to obtain a court judgment, because a tax assessment is given the force of a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.353" offset="4128179">It should be given the force of a judgment because the procedure conducted is much the same way as a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.112" offset="4159213">I will go into a little more detail as to the administrative procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.050" offset="4174886">I think it's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.111" offset="4179170">During the administrative procedure, the taxpayer is allowed to fully develop his facts and legal theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.750" offset="4209681">He can not only present them to the Franchise Tax Board, but he can present them to an independent appellate administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.263" offset="4243745">In addition, he is entitled to an oral agency before that other agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.962" offset="4262553">It is only after he has been afforded his due process rights that the assessment can be final, and only then does he have to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.522" offset="4296826">This is a valid reason why our tax assessment should be given the force of a judgment and why our tax garnishment should be honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.626" offset="4333188">By requiring the Franchise Tax Board to obtain a judgment even after this administrative process has been completed, the Postal Service would require the repetition of the same process in a judicial setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.308" offset="4383970">This obviously does not comport with the prompt collection of revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.434" offset="4400479">Our final assessment, as I stated, also has authority to be given the force of a judgment under the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.818" offset="4441962">In Bull v. United States and GM Leasing... GM Leasing was decided in 1976 by a unanimous Court... this Court affirmed the principle that a tax assessment has the force of a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.892" offset="4494311">The principle was necessary, as this Court explained, because the existence of government depends upon the expedient collection of its revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.312" offset="4527957">Even though the foregoing principles have been recognized by this Court, the Postal Service refused to give the Franchise Tax Board garnishment at least the same respect to that of an ordinary judgment creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.915" offset="4578426">It must be emphasized again that the Postal Service is merely a stakeholder in these garnishment proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.709" offset="4605593">During these proceedings it is not being asked to turn over its own funds; it is simply being asked to turn over funds owing to employee taxpayers who have refused to pay their valid state taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.377" offset="4656271">The Postal Service will not remit these funds to the Franchise Tax Board; yet it must make such remittances to the Internal Revenue Service, in the Ninth Circuit to the Employment Development Department, and to ordinary judgment creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.900" offset="4714367">It is significant to note that the rights of these judgment creditors were only recognized after repetitious and unsuccessful litigation by the Postal Service in seven circuit courts of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.336" offset="4764104">The Postal Service makes a secondary argument with regard to the waiver of sovereign immunity and attempts to support it with Section 5520 of 5 U.S.C. That section authorizes the withholding of local income taxes from federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.873" offset="4838187">The Postal Service alleges there would have been no need to specifically include the Postal Service in Section 5520 if sovereign immunity had been waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.821" offset="4877998">This is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.276" offset="4883849">The legislative history makes it clear the Postal Service did not want to be included in Section 5520.</text>

            <text syncTime="1247.169" offset="5139431">And as I just said, Section 5517 authorizes the federal government to withhold current state taxes from the salaries of federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.745" offset="5189691">In 1974, California and the Department of the Treasury signed an agreement under Section 5517 which implemented current withholding from federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.629" offset="5233263">Section 5517 agreements do not provide authority for a state to require an amount to be taken from a federal employee's wages in payment of a delinquent tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.951" offset="5282478">California has not attempted to use this agreement for such purposes; rather, our authority to garnish Postal Service employees' wages emanates from Section 401 and the Burr decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.151" offset="5335350">The Ninth Circuit confused the concept of current withholding with the collection of a delinquent tax and incorrectly held that these concepts involve the same subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.725" offset="5381639">In their opinion, the agreement covered both areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.004" offset="5402746">They did not understand what the term "withholding" meant, and that it was a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.425" offset="5424375">They incorrectly determined that any amount taken from a Postal Service employee's wages, either for current taxes or delinquent taxes, was withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.294" offset="5463872">Because of this confusion, I will briefly illustrate the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.932" offset="5478501">Probably everyone in this room has an amount withheld from each salary payment to satisfy this year's tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.914" offset="5510370">Hopefully, the total amount withheld over the year will be sufficient to meet the annual obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.708" offset="5537537">This procedure is known as current withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.770" offset="5549763">The collection of delinquent taxes concerns a different subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.768" offset="5569825">If someone fails to satisfy a final tax liability in a timely way, the unpaid amount is delinquent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.373" offset="5600231">That is when summary tax collection procedures, like wage garnishment, take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.683" offset="5621443">In this example, Section 5517 covers only the first part, current withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.323" offset="5647983">It cannot and has not been used by California as authority for the second, the collection of delinquent taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.412" offset="5680375">This conclusion is supported by the legislative history which makes clear that Congress enacted Section 5517 to cooperate with the states in the administration of their tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.594" offset="5729067">Congress could not have intended that when California signed the withholding agreement it forfeited its authority to collect delinquent taxes from the wages of Postal Service employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1533.662" offset="6285371">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.940" offset="6302507">The linchpin of my friend's argument seems to be that the California state administrative tax levy has the force of a judgment or is the equivalent of a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.856" offset="6354125">Now, I don't think that's true, but more to the point, I don't think it's fruitful to try to discuss in the abstract whether the California administrative levy has the force of a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.195" offset="6399474">The question is what Congress intended, and specifically, what Congress intended when it enacted a routine sue and be sued clause as part of the Postal Reorganization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.236" offset="6447644">The question is whether when Congress did this it intended to subject the Postal Service to these administrative levies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.591" offset="6485051">Now, in our view, when Congress said that the Postal Service could be sued, that's what it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.888" offset="6514308">It meant that the Postal Service could be subject to a lawsuit in court, not that the Postal Service could be subject to an administrative order issued without any judicial proceeding whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.571" offset="6568956">This Court has always interpreted sue and be sued clauses according to their literal meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.940" offset="6598527">A sue and be sued clause authorizes a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.234" offset="6615663">A sue and be sued clause does not say and it does not mean that sovereign immunity has simply become inapplicable to a federal agency's affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.621" offset="6661221">Now, I think that what's happened is because sue and be sued clauses are so common and familiar, the Franchise Tax Board has succumbed to the temptation to forget that it is, after all, language in a statute, and it's to be interpreted in the first instance at least according to its plain meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.425" offset="6728408">That is, as I said, how the Court has interpreted sue and be sued clauses and when Congress was including--</text>

            <text syncTime="2221.431" offset="9036483">The one other point that I think is important is that in this case in addition to the plain language of the statute, language interpreted by this Court to mean suits, we have unusually strong, if somewhat unconventional, evidence that the very congressional committees that drafted the Postal Reorganization Act and put the sue and be sued clause into it would have been very surprised to learn that they had rendered the Postal Service subject to orders like the Franchise Tax Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.996" offset="9154661">Shortly after the Postal Reorganization Act took effect, municipal tax collectors from several major cities came to Congress and complained that local income tax delinquencies of federal employees had become a serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.427" offset="9216414">And as my friend pointed out, Postal Service employees were frequently the subject of this discussion, apparently because they're very large in number, they're present in every city, and the turnover in Postal Service jobs is very rapid, and that makes collection more difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.984" offset="9274615">Now, these local tax collectors sought legislation from Congress that would permit the withholding of local income taxes from the wages and salaries of federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.228" offset="9323621">Now, as I said, this proposed legislation was considered by the same committees that had recently drafted the Postal Reorganization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.725" offset="9357580">It was the Post Office and Civil Service Committees of both Houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.614" offset="9369178">Now, the Board concedes in its brief that if its interpretation of the sue and be sued clause were correct, the local tax collectors did not need any additional legislation to deal with the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.283" offset="9423826">They could just have issued administrative orders to the Postal Service, as they would have to any other employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2647.691" offset="10741443">And it seems to me one of those attributes might well be that it should be subject to administrative withholdings in the nature of a garnishment such as this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2663.650" offset="10805286">What Congress... it's true that Congress did change the organization of the Postal Service in some ways, but it did also put in a sue and be sued clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2747.665" offset="11141430">When Congress passed the sue and be sued clause, I should point out it also made the provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act a very heavily... a very heavy qualification on any waiver of immunity from suit applicable to the Postal Service.</text>

            <text syncTime="3203.784" offset="12965822">But the question is whether Congress could have distinguished, the Congress, whether it makes sense to attribute to Congress a distinction between garnishments issued incident to or pursuant to or an execution of a lawsuit or an order to give a court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.261" offset="13027784">And orders that are not garnishments, that are not connected to a court or to judicial process at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.068" offset="13059026">And in view of this Court's... since the question in the case is the interpretation of a sue and be sued clause, and since the Court has consistently said that sue and be sued clauses have to do with judicial process and judicial proceedings, I think the best understanding of Congress' intent is that it did intend to subject the Postal Service only to orders connected to court proceedings or judicial proceedings and not to unadjudicated administrative orders.</text>
