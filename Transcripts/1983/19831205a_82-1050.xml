            <text syncTime="66.692" offset="409606">This case is here on direct appeal to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.029" offset="434893">It involves the government pension offset section in the Social Security Amendments of 1977 and in particular the exception and severability provisions in the offset section.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.504" offset="484839">The District Court, after certifying a nationwide class action, invalidated both the exception and the severability provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.895" offset="526322">Based on those rulings, the District Court extended spousal benefits or expanded the exception to Appellee and the nationwide class of non-dependent men he represents, and as a result, it entitled those non-dependent men to the receipt of both government pension and Social Security spousal benefits.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="130.135" offset="663308">The Social Security Act provides spousal benefits based on the earnings record of the applicant's spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.055" offset="694968">The provisions for wives' and widows' benefits were enacted in 1939, the provisions for husbands' and widowers' benefits in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.262" offset="743869">From the time spousal benefits were first established, the Act has contained a Social Security offset provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.135" offset="779291">That provision requires that were an applicant is entitled to more than one benefit under the Social Security Act, those benefits will be offset against each other so that in net effect the recipient or the applicant will receive only the higher of the two benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.116" offset="851285">For example, if an applicant is entitled to spousal benefits and also to retirement benefits based on his own work account, the spousal benefits will be reduced by the amount of the direct benefit to which the applicant is entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.458" offset="916591">Until the statute at issue in this case, the Act contained no comparable provision for people, primarily government employees, who worked in employment that was not covered by the Social Security system.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.651" offset="977404">In March 1977, this Court decided the Goldfarb case and invalidated the gender-based eligibility standard in the Social Security Act that required men, but not women, to prove dependency in order to be eligible for spousal benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.416" offset="1072490">As a result of Goldfarb, spousal benefits, therefore, were extended to non-dependent men.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.295" offset="1136020">--I don't believe that the issue of extension versus nullification was ever directly litigated in this Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="256.549" offset="1169038">Believing that that to be the result that follows from the decision of this Court, the benefits were extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.536" offset="1188891">That, in practice, did not prove to be a problem for the Social Security Trust Fund with respect to non-dependent men who worked in employment covered by Social Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.093" offset="1239151">Those men usually were entitled to higher benefits on their own work account than on the account of their spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.199" offset="1271543">Because the Social Security Act has an eligibility requirement providing that a spousal applicant must have no or only minimal benefits in his own account and because of the offset, the Social Security offset provision that already existed in the Act, in fact, no spousal payments were generally made to this group of non-dependent men.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.564" offset="1369032">It was a far different situation, however, for non-dependent men who worked in employment that was not covered by Social Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.920" offset="1402468">As to this group, spousal benefits, in fact, were payable, and because they were not subject to the existing Social Security offsets, since they weren't employed in work covered by Social Security, those spousal payments were the full, unreduced amount and were not adjusted in any way to reflect their government pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.148" offset="1483344">This caused a windfall for this group of non-dependent men.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.404" offset="1512392">Because they did not meet the eligibility standards set out by Congress in the Social Security Act, they did not expect to receive spousal benefits and they could not have planned their retirements in reliance on the receipt of such benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.263" offset="1575817">The Goldfarb decision threatened to impose a very serious financial drain on the Social Security Trust Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.203" offset="1607582">Congress responded to this problem by enacting the government offset pension provision that is now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.475" offset="1644676">In this provision, parallel to the Social Security offset that was already in the Act for covered employment, this provision provides that the spousal benefits, that the level of spousal benefits will be reduced by the amount of the government pension to which the applicant is entitled and receives payment based on his own work record.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.542" offset="1744986">The offset provision, the government pension offset provision at issue here applies to spousal benefits that are payable based on valid applications filed on or after December 1, 1977, which was the effective date of the new offset provision for government pensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.356" offset="1828264">Now, the government pension offset provision was a reasonable and a permissible solution to the financial problems confronting the Social Security Trust Fund following Goldfarb.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.747" offset="1873822">But, in enacting this provision, Congress became concerned about a different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.901" offset="1902348">Congress became concerned that the elimination or reduction of dual benefits that would be caused by applying the new government offset provision to people who had planned... Well, to people who had retired or were close to retirement and who had planned a retirement in accordance with pre-Goldfarb law that allowed for unreduced spousal payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.187" offset="2019585">Congress felt that the application of the offset to these people would have imposed a hardship on them and been unfair to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.276" offset="2051873">So, to allay this concern, Congress enacted a specific exception to the government pension offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.215" offset="2087608">The exception provides... The exception applies to people who are retired or are eligible for retirement from government service in the five-year period between December 1977, when the Act was passed, and November 1982, and who could meet the requirements of the Social Security Act in effect and being administered in January of 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.632" offset="2201293">The offset and the exception clause also contain a severability provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.007" offset="2242775">This provides that if the exception is held to be invalid in any respect, the offset itself will remain in effect and that the exception will be eliminated in its entirety rather than extended to new people.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.235" offset="2319784">The severability clause reflects Congress' overriding concern with the financial health of the Social Security Trust Fund and its intention to subordinate retirees' reliance interests to that end if it turned out that the exception as drafted proved to be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.113" offset="2391255">Appellee in this case retired from the United States Postal Service in November 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.088" offset="2431171">He receives a government pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.523" offset="2448934">In December 1977, he submitted an application for spousal benefits based on the work record of his wife who had been employed in a covered job; that is it was covered by the Social Security system, and who was insured under the Social Security program.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.019" offset="2526883">Appellee's application was considered to be filed as a valid application as of January 1978 when he reached the age of 62 and, thus, first became eligible spousal benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.981" offset="2598668">The Social Security Administration found that Appellee was eligible for spousal benefits.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="626.706" offset="2649659">He was not dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.825" offset="2654047">Because he filed his application after the effective date of the offset provision, he was subject to the offset and because, and it is undispute, he was not dependent on his wife, he was not within the protection of the exception clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.065" offset="2711099">Therefore, in the end, the offset applied to him, and because the amount of his government pension exceeded the amount of his spousal benefits the offset required that there were no net spousal benefits payable to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.639" offset="2769300">After Appellee exhausted his administrative remedies, he brought this action under Section 405(g) of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.431" offset="2808483">The District Court struck down both the exception provision and also the severability clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.620" offset="2841293">The Court found that the exception provision incorporated the gender-based dependency test that existed in the Social Security Act in Janury 1977 prior to this Court's decision in Goldfarb.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="694.914" offset="2922482">That the Act did incorporate, absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.283" offset="2931886">Appellee has raised an issue of statutory construction here and it is addressed fully in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.270" offset="2955918">I don't propose to discuss it unless the Court has specific questions about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.906" offset="2970442">But, there are two important constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.210" offset="2983608">The first, as I say, is that the District Court struck down the exception clause because it incorporated the gender-based dependency standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.729" offset="3013701">In addition, the Court also struck down the severability clause because the severability clause required that the offset remain in effect without qualification, and, therefore, a plaintiff who successfully challenged the exception clause would not receive any monetary relief in the form of unreduced spousal benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.979" offset="3106697">Let me turn first to the issue of the exception clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.299" offset="3128013">As Justice White points out, and as we discuss in our brief, we think it is clear that the exception does incorporate the gender-based dependency test that existed prior to Goldfarb.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.106" offset="3175242">But, a gender-based test is not necessarily invalid, rather, as this Court's decisions have recognized, it is permissible if it serves an important governmental objective and if it is substantially related to the achievement of that objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.735" offset="3245773">We think that the exception clause in this case meets both of those criteria.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="781.389" offset="3268343">Is it quite correct to say that is entirely a gender-based clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="785.341" offset="3284121">It does include... The exception clause hits both... rather preserves the benefit for both the retired female government employees and also for dependent spouses for female employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="798.166" offset="3335425">Well, that is correct, and it actually is somewhat more complicated than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.552" offset="3349009">Before I get into the details, let me say that in the end it does include a gender differentiation.</text>

            <text syncTime="812.941" offset="3394566">But, as far as whose money is involved, if you get all the facts on the table, there are both men and women who are benefited by it.</text>

            <text syncTime="819.931" offset="3422465">At the same time, there are men who are not benefited, would be benefited if they were women.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.633" offset="3441273">And, for that reason, and because the intent of Congress is so clear argue that it is not subject to review as a gender-based standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.774" offset="3485891">But, to follow up on your observation, Justice Stevens, there are both men and women who are eligible under the pre-Goldfarb law and their reliance interests are protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.062" offset="3519014">Similarly, because of the effective date provision of the Act, any non-dependent men made eligible as a result of Goldfarb, who filed a valid application for benefits prior to December 1977, are also protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.639" offset="3577319">In other words, they are not subject to the offset by virtue of the effective date provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.024" offset="3594873">Both of those classes are protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.960" offset="3606681">On the other side of the line, there is one group of women who are not eligible for benefits under pre-Goldfarb law but are now eligible for such benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.649" offset="3641371">That is the group of divorced wives and surviving divorced wives who were married more than ten but less than twenty years.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.837" offset="3670106">Because they were not eligible under pre-Goldfarb law, they do not come within the exception, and, therefore, are subject to the offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.793" offset="3705946">In addition, non-dependent men after Goldfarb who make no claim of reliance on that decision, who were unaware of it or admit that it did not enter into their thinking at all, are also subject to the offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.870" offset="3766237">They had no reliance interests to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.589" offset="3777104">So, there are men and women on both sides of the line of the offset and the distinguishing characteristic between them is the reliance interests of the category in which they fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.428" offset="3816496">The protection of reliance interests as those lines suggest was the very purpose that Congress had in mind in enacting the exception provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.068" offset="3863099">Congress was concerned in particular about the reliance interests of retirees who had planned their retirements in accordance with the long-standing provisions of the Social Security Act that Congress had passed and that had been on the books since 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.030" offset="3934883">The legislative record makes clear that this is the purpose that Congress actually had in its collective mind in enacting the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.420" offset="3972500">There was no sexist animus or motivation on the part of Congress here.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.158" offset="4003428">Congress did not indulge in archaic or sterotypical assumptions about the role of women in our society and did not adopt the exception based on reflexive or uncritical habit.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.585" offset="4061107">In this case, Congress knew full well what it was doing and it based the exception on the historical fact of reliance pre-Goldfarb law.</text>

            <text syncTime="991.976" offset="4110740">Mr. Levy, do you think it would make any difference if instead of a five-year period, that Congress had extended it to cover up to the year 2010 or something?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="1004.716" stopTime="1657.639">
            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="1004.716" offset="4161626">Well, it might make a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.735" offset="4165701">It would depend in part on why Congress did it and what the expansion was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.370" offset="4184300">But, we think, if anything, the five-year period was on the short rather than the long side of the permissible spectrum given the nature of retirement earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.310" offset="4220036">Someone who is six years from retirement might well be hard pressed in that relatively short period of time to make up the reliance that has been bashed as a result of the offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.601" offset="4261205">But, Congress felt that five years was appropriate and there is certainly nothing to suggest that that determination was impermissible in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.088" offset="4291193">It is a line-drawn problem inherent in the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.624" offset="4301329">It is not itself a gender issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.741" offset="4313763">Now, the protection of these reliance interests that motivated Congress, we submit, is a legitimate and important governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.716" offset="4353678">We think that proposition is sound and self-evident on its face, especially given the nature of the Social Security system and the nature of the retirement planning process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.041" offset="4410939">I also think that this Court's decisions in a wide range of areas have recognized reliance interests of much the same sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.713" offset="4445629">It was not improper for Congress to be concerned about the hardship and disruption that would have been caused if the new offset provision were applied to people who were retired or close to retirement and who had planned their retirement in accordance with pre-Goldfarb law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.876" offset="4522325">In addition to that purpose being important and legitimate, we also submit that the exception clause is substantially related to the achievement of that purpose and it rests on a reasoned analysis of the statutory classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.319" offset="4592020">Indeed, by incorporating the pre-Goldfarb law in the exception provision, the exception is precisely suited to the protection of that reliance interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.311" offset="4644055">In addition, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, the exception is limited to a transitional five-year period which Congress determined was a reasonable time to protect people against the disruption of their retirement plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.357" offset="4716258">We also would point out that when the exception clause expired by its own terms in December of 1982, and, thus, the pre-Goldfarb reliance interests had then been satisfied, Congress twice reconsidered the offset provision and on both occasions it enacted an gender-neutral provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.020" offset="4798909">We think that confirms what was evident in the initial Act, that Congress limited the gender-based classification to what was necessary to protect the pre-Goldfarb reliance interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.530" offset="4852931">Finally, in enacting the exception and offset in 1977, Congress considered other alternatives, but it rejected them as less desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.171" offset="4907474">The legislative record makes it clear that Congress adopted the offset and exception provisions as a deliberate policy choice in preference to other approaches they might have taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.863" offset="4966197">Now, Appellee seeks to upset Congress' policy choice and makes two arguments that the exception is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.119" offset="5003291">First, he argues that the protection of the pre-Goldfarb reliance interest was not a legitimate and important governmental objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.927" offset="5046550">As Congress recognized though, and we think it quite plain, we don't... The reliance interests of people under the prior law, in accordance with the provisions passed by Congress and in effect since 1939, cannot be so easily dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.306" offset="5116036">Such reliance is not discredited in any way by the fact that this Court in Goldfarb ultimately held the statute to violate equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.928" offset="5158459">As in cases such as Lemon versus Kurtzman and the Manhart and the Norris decisions, reliance on a prior state of the law, even if that law turned out eventually to be improper or unconstitutional, does not make that reliance illegitimate and does not detract from the importance of protecting the reliance interests that arose under prior law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.229" offset="5263680">Appellee also makes a second argument that the statutory classification here is underinclusive because it doesn't protect the asserted reliance interests of non-dependent men who claim to have relied on Goldfarb between the time it was announced in March of 1977, and the enactment of the offset provisions in December 1977, and who did not file a valid application for spousal benefits prior to the effective date of the offset, December 1, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.550" offset="5404950">We don't think that Congress was required, however, to recognize this short-lived and new-found reliance interests of men that was based on the extension of benefits following Goldfarb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.494" offset="5464718">Congress could conclude, in the context of the pressing need for the offset itself... and it is important to remember that the offset is the principal provision here to which the exception is a specific exemption... in that context Congress could concluded that the reliance interest advanced by Appellee was less substantial and less deserving of protection than the long-standing reliance interest under the statute passed by Congress prior to Goldfarb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.062" offset="5579030">As Justice Stevens and I discussed before, there are men and women on both sides of the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.251" offset="5611840">The interest that Appellee asserts was based on the Goldfarb decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.690" offset="5645590">Let me come at it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.856" offset="5650188">That was a very recent decision at the time and Congress could reasonably have concluded that it was unlikely to have lead to widespread and significant reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.264" offset="5691879">In addition, it was possible, as in fact turned out to be the case, that Congress would pass a statute in response to the Goldfarb decision and that statute would affect the newly recognized claims of non-dependent men such as Appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.310" offset="5768052">Neither of those considerations applies to the reliance interests of the pre-Goldfarb retirees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.065" offset="5795011">And, for that reason, we think the statute is perfectly constitutional to distinguish between those groups and does not raise any constitutional difficulties because it is limited to the interest that Congress found to be more substantial and more worthy of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.658" offset="5857391">I should go on to say that even if Congress was required to accommodate the interest in some way that Appellee asserts, its failure to do so does not establish that the exception clause as it exists is not substantially related to the protection of reliance interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.072" offset="5947043">Justice Stevens and I discussed before the somewhat complicated application of this statute, the four different groups, the validity of which Appellee doesn't challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.414" offset="5996467">The only group that Appellee raises is this narrow group of men who relied between Goldfarb and the enactment of the offset provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.620" offset="6037322">Even though that limited group was not taken into account, we think it is clear that there still is a substantial fit between the exception clause and the protection of reliance interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.933" offset="6114540">And, in assessing the substantiality of the fit, it is important again to note that even if Appellees reliance interest had to be included at all, they are still less substantial than the groups that are now protected under the statute, less substantial than the long-standing reliance interest under pre-Goldfarb law and they are less substantial than the interest of non-dependent men who submitted a valid application and were receiving or were entitled to receive spousal benefits between March and December of 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.989" offset="6250795">Appellee's standard is also one based on a subjective reliance interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.194" offset="6283605">Such a category under the statute would constitute a marked departure from the easily determined objective criteria now in the exception and the offset provisions and would be extremely difficult and burdensome for the government to administer in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.758" offset="6361868">For all of these reasons, we think the exception clause itself is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.845" offset="6390184">In the event the Court disagrees with that submission, however, it must then address the constitutionality of the severability clause, which, as I mentioned before, provides that if the exception is invalid in any respect, the offset will remain in effect without qualification and the exception to the offset will be eliminated in its entirety rather than extended to people whom Congress did not intend to be within it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.133" offset="6515363">The District Court held that the severability clause was unconstitutional because it was a usurpation of judicial authority and, therefore, invalid under Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.107" offset="6571265">We think the severability clause is plainly constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.879" offset="6598328">It is a substantive rule of law governing the distribution of Social Security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.050" offset="6626958">It is a rule of law that is to be applied in the event that the exception clause, as Congress drafted it, is held to be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.508" offset="6668859">The severability clause reflects Congress' overriding concern with the fiscal integrity of the Social Security Trust Fund is threatened by the decision in Goldfarb and it indicates Congress' intention to subordinate retirees' reliance interests to that paramount end, that the balance struck by Congress in the exception was impermissible.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="1664.562" offset="6801038">Well, this is a severability clause in the usual sense in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.281" offset="6819951">First, it provides that the offset will be severed in its entirety and remain in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.685" offset="6845551">It also discusses the severability of the exception provision and provides that any remaining valid portions of the exception will not be severed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.291" offset="6879928">The severability clause does not always have to be in favor of severability we don't believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.547" offset="6905006">It can just as well, and as Congress found here, be in favor of non-severability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.664" offset="6921411">It was a perfectly reasonable goal for Congress to try to protect the Social Security Trust Fund from great liability if it turned out that it could not limit the exception to the group of people that it considered to be most worthy of special consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.678" offset="7009495">Now, severability is a question of legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.999" offset="7030811">In essence, it is a statement by Congress of the statute it would have enacted, what it would have done, if it had known at the outset that the statute as drafted was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.022" offset="7066860">Here, Congress explicitly and clearly defined the scope of the statute it was enacting and we think it acted well within its legislative powers in so doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.329" offset="7116075">In addition, the severability clause is also supported by the decisions of this Court indicating that an under inclusive statute can be remedied either by extension or by nullification of its benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.987" offset="7170723">Either approach is constitutionally adequate and the choice between those remedial alternatives is a question of legislative intent and that Congress indicated its intent clearly here does not render the severability clause suspect or invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.247" offset="7231745">I would only note in closing that the District Court felt that there was an Article III standing problem in the severability clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.620" offset="7269257">The severability clause is a rule of law and does not purport to effect the Article III power or jurisdiction of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.060" offset="7303007">In addition, it doesn't go to the standing of Appellee or any other plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.928" offset="7318472">Appellee has standing because he was subject to the offset and not within the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.714" offset="7337698">In any event, there is no rule of law that says a plaintiff has to be entitled to monetary relief in order to have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.236" offset="7367686">On the contrary, we think Appellee unquestionably had standing, notwithstanding the severability clause, to pursue his right to equal treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1822.012" offset="7430798">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.864" offset="7442292">Before I address Mr. Mathews' arguments on the issues in this case, I would like to preface my remarks with a characterization that has been made on the exception clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.605" offset="7485237">The exception clause has been characterized by the Solicitor as being a transitional device.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.576" offset="7509061">It is not that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.009" offset="7514808">It is a lifetime exemption for everyone who qualifies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.980" offset="7534661">Those individuals, those females, those non-dependent females, and those dependent men who get into this window that is created by the exception clause will remain within that window or within that class throughout their lifetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.072" offset="7595056">So, this is not a device that beginning in 1983, this year, will entitle Mr. Mathews to benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.409" offset="7624418">Please, that characterization is going to be important when you compare the Social Security contributions of the spouses and see the inequality that is achieved under the statute as designed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.617" offset="7669244">The fundamental question before this Court is if the exception clause is interpreted in one fashion whether or not there has been a perpetuation of the unconstitutional sex discrimination that occurred in Goldfarb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.644" offset="7729326">The statute is important, both to classes of men, as indicated by Mr. Robert Mathews, but perhaps more importantly from a constitutional standpoint from that of Mary Mathews, because it depreciates her Social Security contributions while at the same time provides less financial resources for her family unit than what is provided to a similarly situated male applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.563" offset="7841025">That is important as far as the focus of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.765" offset="7857848">The fundamental question is divided into three areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.217" offset="7871641">First of all, a statutory interpretation issue, whether or not the exception clause incorporates a gender-based dependency test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.656" offset="7905391">The second issue is whether or not there has been a denial of equal protection to Mary Mathews; and, third, whether this Court should extend or nullify the exception clause as stated in the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.665" offset="7961502">Directing my attention first of all to the statutory argument, in essence, it is Mr. Mathews' position that there is a statutory basis for affirmance in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.121" offset="8003298">The Solicitor asked the Court in brief to focus on two items.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.759" offset="8025868">First of all, the language of the statute, which he said is clear and unambiguous and, second of all, its legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.448" offset="8056588">Focusing on the first of those, the language of the statute itself, if the Court will review Section 334(g), there is nothing in that statute indicating that dependency is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.707" offset="8113639">It does not per se require dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.576" offset="8125133">Now, please keep in mind the framework under which that clause was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.711" offset="8145613">That clause was passed after Congress had known how the Court was going to interpret Section 402(c) of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.086" offset="8191171">In essence, reading out gender-based dependency as being a requirement for special benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2263.231" offset="9195735">Beyond that the language of the statute itself uses terminology as it affects and being administered in January of 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.855" offset="9234188">Peculiarly, there is not anything in the legislative history indicating why the date of January 1977 was selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.627" offset="9269296">There is nothing indicating that that date has particular importance as opposed to December 1976 or February 1977, and until that keystone of construction is reached, there is not necessarily the meaning asked by the Solicitor to be given to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.720" offset="9337633">As being administered, that particular portion of the phrase of the statute is also important because the Secretary at that particular time in January of 1977 was not administering the statute to preclude benefits because of dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.349" offset="9408163">They were administering the statute by simply taking a pot full of applications and holding them in abeyance until the Court made its decision in Goldfarb.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.589" offset="9449123">Ostensibly, after the Goldfarb opinion was announced, all of those applications for benefits, be they in January of 1977 or for six months prior, were given full force and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.064" offset="9499069">Those benefits were paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.749" offset="9505757">The second issue in this case deals with an equal protection issue and applies to the case of Mary Mathews.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.987" offset="9534700">The Solicitor has stated that the standards be applied by this Court, and one which we accept, is that the exception clause must serve an important governmental interest and at the same time the means selected by Congress must be substantially related to the achievement of that important governmental objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.583" offset="9621113">Now, a remark that the Solicitor does not make that is, however, important that when you attempt to analyze the situation, is who must bear the burden of proving that particular standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.874" offset="9666253">The Court has indicated that the burden of proving that the discrimination, if it is there, serves an important governmental purpose and is substantially related, rests upon the Secretary in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.199" offset="9715572">It is not a burden that Mr. Mathews has to bear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.503" offset="9728842">I will ask the Court then to focus in on the interests and the means selected by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2693.759" offset="10917832">If you accept for a minute your proposition that there is such things as reliance interest, then in that situation you have a failure of the statute to be sufficiently tailored to protect those reliance interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="2725.381" offset="11044264">--Yes, Your Honor, but he is in the reliance of the state of the law at the time he made his retirement decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.534" offset="11064953">He made his retirement... He first considered making his retirement decision in September of 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.438" offset="11092539">At that time, the state of the law would entitle him to special benefits if he submitted an application and otherwise qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.794" offset="11122005">He forewent three years of continued employment with the Post Office based upon the statements from the local Social Security office that he would receive benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.000" offset="11162756">And, for that reason he cannot now go back... with a change in legislative approach to the question of exception clause... he cannot now go back and attempt to change that decision and be rehired by the Post Office in order to gain additional three years of employment that he has suffered through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.276" offset="11227853">Perhaps more importantly to the overall issue of equal protection is our third argument that we have argued which is the challenge that it presents to the judicial authority of this Court in the area of equal protection analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.102" offset="11283233">If the Court will allow the Secretary in this instance or allow Congress in this instance to pass legislation to protect reliance interests, then it can perhaps thwart equal protection review because, as we have pointed out and as we have argued, in each and every instance there probably will be some individuals who would have relied upon the ostensible unconstitutional law and could be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.551" offset="11385006">For example, in the area of desegregation, this similar approach could be analogized to the approach taken in the exception clause by Congress or the states in particular cases indicating that rather follow the Court's decision in Brown, instead, what we are going to attempt to do is we are going to allow protective reliance interests of everyone who bought homes in particular neighborhoods, reliance on the fact that they could send their children to segregated schools, and continue the effect of an unlawful statute and unconstitutional statutes for many years in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.324" offset="11528052">The third issue that is perhaps the important one that really threatens the Court's authority is in the area of the inverse severability clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.549" offset="11569012">Let me pause for a moment to characterize that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.833" offset="11582073">It is not the traditional severability clause that the Court has considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.119" offset="11599314">This is an inverse severability clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.654" offset="11609450">It attempts to impose upon this Court a rule of decision in this particular case, not simply to save a remaining portion of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.029" offset="11646857">There are three problems that Mr. Matthews can identify with that particular clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.266" offset="11671830">The first deals with the threat to the judiciary and to the process of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.068" offset="11691056">If, on the surface, the clause is accepted as valid, then there is no means for judicial review for what is considered an equal protection violation within this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.942" offset="11734524">Mr. Mathews must go entirely remediless in this particular context of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2943.387" offset="11916336">And, of course, the Court must, in the first instance, examine the legislative history of the statute and we would not argue to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3018.436" offset="12216535">I view the statute as simply being an indication of legislative intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3036.397" offset="12288424">--Your Honor, they did, but at the time that they voted to pass it please keep in mind that they had no written report before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.484" offset="12316741">They didn't have the text of the statute before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.103" offset="12327190">They waived all of those rules in order to pass the particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.407" offset="12344431">This is, as best our research can determine, the first instance in which Congress has interposed an inverse severability clause on a piece of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.846" offset="12386227">Obviously, in light of the Goldfarb decision, there is some question to the viability of the equal protection basis for the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.368" offset="12416215">Now, to the extent that we look to the sufficiency of the remedy, it is Mr. Mathews' contention that the remedy in this particular case to him is entirely inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.176" offset="12463445">We had a very similar situation that came up in the District Court in the Rosofsky decision based upon the same exception clause, based upon the same principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.465" offset="12504614">In that particular case, the District Court applied the inverse severability clause and in essence required Mr. Rosofsky to go remediless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.673" offset="12545469">He had no remedy although there was, in fact, found a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.493" offset="12568771">There is no mechanism within the statute, the inverse severability clause, in which Congress explored how they wanted the inverse severability clause to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.265" offset="12607850">We have a second problem here and that deals with retroactive benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.419" offset="12628434">Now, on the one hand, if you accept the principle of the inverse severability clause, it is in direct conflict with Congress' enactment of Section 204(b) of the Social Security Act which says that benefits that are paid in good faith will not be recouped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.446" offset="12696562">So, in this particular situation, from 1977 or from the date of the order in this case, December 1979, up until the date of this Court's decision, unless the Court awards relief to Mr. Mathews, all benefits will have been paid to his opposing class in direct conflict with the intent of the inverse severability clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.128" offset="12787259">So, it would seem apparent that the Court must, at the very least, award the class represented by Mr. Mathews retroactive benefits back to the time of his application and only apply perspective nullification of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.340" offset="12852147">We would argue in the contrary that the best approach to take at this particular point would be for the Court to simply not nullify the statute, but extent the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.361" offset="12888196">At that time they could leave a reasoned decision and analysis to Congress as to how Congress would apply the situation in the future, but award the class the back benefits for the time that they were discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.288" offset="12947964">In summary, there are in essence three issues before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.507" offset="12964787">There is, first of all, a statutory interpretation issue which, if accepted based upon the principles that the District Court of the Ninth Circuit have announced, would allow a means in which this Court could avoid a constitutional issue, yet at the same time give some meaning to the statute and give some meaning to the fact that the Court did have the Goldfarb decision which was known by Congress at that time they passed the exception clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.557" offset="13064993">The second aspect requiring affirmance in this situation deals with the violation of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.961" offset="13090593">The violation occurs to Mary Mathews because it provides less benefits for her and her family unit than what it provided to a similarly situated male.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.250" offset="13131762">On the surface, reliance interest does not seem to be in this context of this case after there has been a decision of unconstitutionality to be an important governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.458" offset="13176588">The statute surely is not narrowly tailored because the class, as indicated by Mr. Mathews, certainly are not offered protection for their legitimate reliance interests that have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.182" offset="13219533">The last aspect requiring affirmance is in the area of the inverse severability clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.484" offset="13240744">That is an attempt to thwart judicial review in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.788" offset="13253910">It would require Mr. Robert Mathews to go remediless, albeit there is an unconstitutional violation of his rights and the rights of Mary Mathews.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.644" offset="13293407">Unless this Court provides some mechanism which in this case goes back to the Court's initial reasoning in the Westcott decision that the most appropriate remedy in this case must be extension of the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.969" offset="13346697">Allow Congress to act after the Court's decision, but until that time, extend the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.873" offset="13370312">If there are no further questions, we would ask the District Court's decision be affirmed.</text>
