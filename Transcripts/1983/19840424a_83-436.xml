            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="9.402" offset="179826">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.260" offset="191320">This case raises questions about the President's authority in connection with national emergency economic embargoes, that is, in connection with programs of comprehensive control on financial and property transactions that apply to a few countries with which our foreign relations are in a state of very special and acute difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.467" offset="292152">This case involves Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.545" offset="300407">The embargo that is involved here is very much like the Iranian assets control program that was before the Court in Dames &amp; Moore, and the case involves the very statute considered in Dames &amp; Moore, the Trading With the Enemy Act of 1917 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which is known as IEPPA&gt; ["].</text>
            <text syncTime="62.817" offset="393507">Specifically, this case presents the question of the validity of regulations issued in 1982 by the Treasury which prohibit certain financial transactions incident to travel to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.544" offset="448469">In effect, these regulations provide that Americans traveling to Cuba may spend money for Cuban goods and services only if the travel involves Government business or involves journalism or involves scholarly research or a visit to close relatives, or if it is authorized by a specific license in connection with humanitarian activities or in connection with sporting or artistic exhibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.658" offset="560900">The regulations do not prohibit travel as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.594" offset="576678">You are free to go to Cuba if, for instance, you have friends or relatives who invite you or will fund you, or if the Cuban Government or a Cuban organization will fund your visit, so that hard currency is not spent in Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.369" offset="635715">But you can't spend American dollars in Cuba unless you fall within one of the licensed categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.384" offset="663823">The 1982 regulations here modified a general license which had been issued by President Carter in March of 1977... that's an important date... which gave permission to Americans to spend American dollars when they went to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.905" offset="741876">Now, that general license itself was, however, subject to important qualifications on the flow of American travel dollars to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.697" offset="781060">For instance, American credit card companies were not allowed to make credit card arrangements in Cuba, and that made it harder for Americans to travel on credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.209" offset="819094">Perhaps more significant, travelers who wanted to go to Cuba under that general license pretty much had to arrange for charter travel, because financial transactions in connection with any scheduled voyages to Cuba were not permitted by that license.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.921" offset="885968">Both the '77 license and the '82 modifications were part of the overall Cuban assets control regulations, regulations that continuously since 1963 have subjected all economic transactions between Americans and Cuba or Cubans to a comprehensive system of licensure.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.426" offset="975934">Section 201(b) of the Cuban assets control regulations has since '63 provided that no economic transaction in which Cuba has any interest may go forward without a license from the Treasury, so that by the terms of regulation 201(b) it has been unlawful since 1963 to spend American dollars in connection with travel to Cuba unless you had a Treasury license.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.728" offset="1089201">Now, from '63 to '77 these licenses were issued on an individual basis to particular individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.601" offset="1120652">Then in '77 came the general license, which was in turn modified in 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.142" offset="1150850">The legal issue before the Court is whether there is a valid legal authority for the 1982 modifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.671" offset="1184913">The Cuban assets control regulations were themselves issued under Section 5(b) of the TWEA, Trading With the Enemy Act, which broadly authorizes the President during war or during peacetime declared national emergencies to use rules or regulations or licenses to regulate or prohibit any transaction involving any property in which Cuba... in which a foreign country or a foreign national has any interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.236" offset="1307166">Now, as explained in our briefs, the question in the case arises because the TWEA was amended by Congress in December of 1977 to apply generally only during wartime.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.418" offset="1371950">Peacetime economic embargoes in connection with future national emergencies were switched by Congress onto a different statutory track under a new statute, IEEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.475" offset="1420120">IEEPA gave the President pretty much the same substantive authority as he had under the TWEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.271" offset="1443316">In fact, IEEPA replicates the Section 5(b) TWEA language relevant to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.830" offset="1469543">But IEEPA lays down new procedures and new predicates for the exercise of those peacetime powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.247" offset="1495248">Mr. Bator, what other countries were there at the time of the grandfather clause enactment which our Government had a broad prohibition on unlicensed property transfers?</text>

            <text syncTime="355.507" offset="1564316">The major standing embargoes in '77 were Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam and Cambodia.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator" startTime="363.879" stopTime="386.870">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="363.879" offset="1597752">There was... the China situation is complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.471" offset="1612172">There was a general assets embargo, but it had been pretty much reduced to an assets freeze by the time of the statute through general licenses, so that the China situation was very different from these four comprehensive ones in terms of--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="386.870" stopTime="392.977">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="386.870" offset="1689703">But arguably within the same authority--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator" startTime="392.977" stopTime="411.376">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="392.977" offset="1714154">--The China situation to us is the most difficult or the most borderline one as to what exactly was grandfathered and what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.566" offset="1744561">The China issue is pretty much moot by the fact that the whole embargo was taken off when the general settlement was made with China somewhat later.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="411.376" stopTime="415.701">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="411.376" offset="1787715">--But under your theory perhaps could be restored, is that correct?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator" startTime="415.701" stopTime="692.020">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="415.701" offset="1805060">It's... the Government simply has not taken a position, Your Honor, on the question of whether the legislative intent with respect to China is clear enough to warrant reimposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.724" offset="1869112">Of course, it couldn't be reimposed now because the whole assets situation... there would be no continuity now, since there was a general takeover.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.926" offset="1897952">So that as of how that issue really is moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.317" offset="1907565">That is, we do not contend that the grandfather clause authorizes the reimposition of embargoes which have been completely eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.141" offset="1942778">As Justice O'Connor question indicates, the problem of this case arises because, although Congress switched new national emergency embargoes onto the IEEPA track, future ones, at the same time it did grandfather the existing embargoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.585" offset="2020623">Congress decided that it did not want to force the President to issue new national emergency declarations under IEEPA in order to continue the four existing embargo systems in operation in 1977, and therefore it specified in the grandfather clause that TWEA authorities which were being exercised on July 1, 1977, could continue to be exercised as long as the President makes an annual determination that that is in the national interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.088" offset="2154578">And Presidents Carter and Reagan have each year made that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.146" offset="2174850">Now, the Court of Appeals in this case held that the President was without authority in 1982 to modify the 1977 general license which governed the flow of hard currency to Cuba, because it reasoned that the '77 general license permitted many trave-related financial transactions; it was issued a few months before the July 1, '77, cutoff, and therefore it concluded that the authority to regulate those transactions was simply not being exercised at all on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.273" offset="2315388">The Government believes that the most substantial question before the Court is the question of the proper scope of the grandfather clause, and that President Carter's 1977 general license is perhaps a good starting point for the analysis of that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.924" offset="2389994">As I said, the Court of Appeals concluded that, since the March '77 general license authorized most travel-related expenditures, it follows that the authority to regulate them was not being exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.089" offset="2442657">But we think that's a complete non sequitur and that it is based on a misunderstanding of the structure of the Cuban assets control program.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.196" offset="2475049">We think the authority to regulate financial transactions incident to travel was being exercised on that date at four different levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.737" offset="2517158">First, we have regulation 201(b), which prohibited all property transactions unless licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.875" offset="2549759">This represented an underlying exercise of authority to demand licensure, and that has been continuously asserted since 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.544" offset="2592391">Second, the general license gave permission to engage in transactions incident to travel, but against the background of regulation 201(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="624.243" offset="2639202">We think this was an act of regulation, not of deregulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.536" offset="2656443">That is, the Court of Appeals simply assumed that the exercise of an authority to regulate only goes on at such times when the activity is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.830" offset="2697612">But we think that's a false picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.951" offset="2706076">It distorts the nature of a system of licensure.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.075" offset="2718614">Regulatory authority does not simply vanish when it is exercised to license an activity, and this point is made very plain by the words of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.947" offset="2762082">The grandfather clause doesn't authorize the preservation simply of prohibitions on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.490" offset="2788205">It authorizes the reservation of authorities being exercised under 5(b), and 5(b) specifies that its authorities include the power to regulate, "regulate" by means of "licenses".</text>
            <text syncTime="681.136" offset="2866781">So to us the message is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.461" offset="2876081">Congress was referring to the continuation of a licensing system, an ongoing licensing system, which of course--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="692.020" stopTime="719.823">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="692.020" offset="2910353">Do you think the message was as clear in the minds of Congress as it is to you from looking at the structure of the legislation?</text>
            <text syncTime="701.328" offset="2947552">Certainly there are expressions in the legislative history that would indicate that members of Congress may have had a different view and that they were really concerned about thinking that the authorities then being exercised were being grandfathered in, but nothing else.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator" startTime="719.823" stopTime="748.449">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="719.823" offset="3021530">--Well, Justice O'Connor, I think that there are countervailing intonations and quite often rather loose language in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.132" offset="3058833">Congress was torn by the fact that it wanted to accomplish two ends: one, to narrow the President's authority to use these peacetime embargoes; on the other hand, very clearly to allow the President to continue to operate these existing embargoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.702" offset="3129050">That really was the compromise.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="748.449" stopTime="760.928">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="748.449" offset="3136051">Well, I haven't spotted anything in the legislative history that clearly indicates that the members of Congress were as aware of the structure that you propose.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator" startTime="760.928" stopTime="1087.605">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="760.928" offset="3185997">Well, Your Honor, in our brief we do indicate that there are passages, although they are not as... we would be happier if they were clearer, but we think there are in fact specific examples in the legislative history where it was indicated that what would be grandfathered was an embargo system, not simply a kind of frozen list of specific prohibitions, because there was no reference, certainly no reference to anything involving the fact that travel was not to be regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.854" offset="3321730">There is no specific indication of that in the history of the grandfather clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.400" offset="3339911">Congress must have been aware, Your Honor, that assets controls programs generally have been ongoing and rather flexible systems, subject to adjustment from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.704" offset="3397067">There is another point here, which is that travel in fact was being regulated at that time because the '77 license, general license, did include some specific regulations and prohibitions on financial transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.010" offset="3466343">Now, that fact, of course, must be a major embarrassment to the Respondents' theory of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.303" offset="3491525">It's ignored in their brief, ignored by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.837" offset="3505632">It raises a very important question.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.754" offset="3517230">On July 1, '77, President Carter was in fact prohibiting certain financial transactions incident to personal travel, including all transactions incident to scheduled travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.483" offset="3572192">Now, how, in light of that, can it be said that the authority to regulate travel-related financial expenditures was not being exercised?</text>
            <text syncTime="865.480" offset="3604165">I remind the Court, too, that the '77 general license, which is so critical to the Court of Appeals' theory of this case, was explicitly by regulation subject to revocation and modification, and in that respect we think this case is governed and controlled by Dames &amp; Moore, because in Dames &amp; Moore the Court explicitly held that a general license subject to revocation is a contingent instrument, subordinate to the President's continuing underlying regulatory authority, and that reasoning seems to us compelling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.591" offset="3748675">I want to go back to Justice O'Connor's question, which I think is really the heart of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.087" offset="3774588">What could Congress have had in mind when they grandfathered this?</text>
            <text syncTime="912.696" offset="3793083">We think that it is simply an incoherent account of what Congress could have meant to suppose that they were simply freezing an existing laundry list of specific prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.455" offset="3856090">We don't think this is a sensible or a credible reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.812" offset="3869465">I don't think Congress could have wished to freeze the North Korean and the Vietnamese and the Cuban embargoes so that the President couldn't fill in loopholes or gaps, that he couldn't clarify coverage, that he couldn't add a restriction, for instance, in connection with a negotiation to create an incentive for settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.365" offset="3963715">The ironic thing actually is that under the Court of Appeals' reading the executive may even be disabled from amending an embargo to implement a negotiated settlement with another country, because that settlement might call for the addition of new 5(b) measures, as indeed happened in the Iranian settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.906" offset="4041873">Again perhaps for example to look at the general license, it's an interesting example, because when it was first issued in March of '77 it did not include the restriction on financial transactions incident to scheduled travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.571" offset="4108538">That was added in May of '77.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.130" offset="4118778">Now, suppose it had been added in August rather than in May.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.850" offset="4133615">Is it conceivable that the President would have been disabled from making it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.472" offset="4152110">That was obviously an afterthought or, if you will, the filling in of something that was just overlooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.172" offset="4174993">But that kind of adjustment could not be made, we don't think that it creates a coherent system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.918" offset="4201952">Now, the Court of Appeals' answer to this was, use IEEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.056" offset="4218461">But to use IEPPA requires the President to issue a new national emergency declaration, and a declaration that Cuba or Vietnam represents an unusual or extraordinary threat to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.160" offset="4282931">And Justice O'Connor, if there's anything clear from the legislative history, it is that the Congress was persuaded by the Administration in this compromise that it would be undesirable and awkward to force the President to declare such a new emergency and make such a statement in order to maintain these four extraordinary embargoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.337" offset="4371643">The purpose of Congress to allow the President to maintain these four extraordinary embargoes without declaring a new national emergency would simply be frustrated if what we say is that the only thing that can be preserved is a frozen list of restrictions, that is, that a new declaration has to be made every time there is an adjustment or a gap filled or a new restriction imposed in order to create a bargaining chip.</text>

            <text syncTime="1217.190" offset="5011016">It just gives a clue to how these programs in fact are managed and that there is a constant system of adjustments and repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.877" offset="5049782">I want to say a word... I have only a few minutes left... about the Passport Act of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.652" offset="5080920">That's a statute which the Respondents say forbids the use of TWEA authorities or IEEPA authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.931" offset="5113938">Even if they did exist and even if TWEA authorities were grandfathered, they say that the Passport Act of '78 revoked, restricted, prohibited the President from regulating expenditures incident to personal travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.254" offset="5179245">They say that expenditures to personal travel are simply now a special category which may not be regulated under these comprehensive embargoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.138" offset="5222817">We think this reading would... in fact, we think it necessarily follows that what Congress on that reading, what Congress was doing in '78 was invalidating the '77 general license with its restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.771" offset="5285302">We think that this reading means that President Carter violated the Passport Act when in 1980 he used IEEPA to control expenditures, to prohibit expenditures in connection with travel to Iran.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.345" offset="5339636">And the point is significant to us because the Carter Administration was instrumental in the Passport Act of '78.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.594" offset="5368685">Nevertheless, President Carter clearly assumed that the Passport Act did not override this preexisting separate power to regulate travel expenditures in the context of comprehensive assets embargoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.898" offset="5441827">And we think that's the natural assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.992" offset="5450187">The Passport Act says nothing about economic or financial transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.738" offset="5469204">It says nothing about anything except the regulation of passports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.971" offset="5482161">Nothing in the legislative history indicates that Congress was overriding an independent, long-standing regulatory power to restrict the flow of financial and economic benefits to countries which... and I want to remind the Court, the few countries with which by hypothesis our relations are in a state of acute difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.320" offset="5579545">The Respondents speak as if it were somehow inconceivable that Congress could say that passports must be issued on the one hand and yet that the President could continue to exercise an authority to restrict the flow of American dollars from American travelers abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.128" offset="5642761">But there's nothing inconceivable about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.830" offset="5653628">It's an absolute commonplace of modern public policy in many countries... England and France... that have created fiscal restrictions on the expenditure of travel moneys, without in any way aiming at travel as such or trying to restrict the liberty of the citizens to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.011" offset="5734294">And we do not credit the Respondents' suggestion that the TWEA on our reading, the grandfathered authority, can be used to negate the Passport Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.379" offset="5783823">We're talking about four grandfathered embargoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.440" offset="5796048">We're talking about the regulation of travel expenditures as a subsidiary element in the context of comprehensive assets programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.297" offset="5831470">We think that's simply a different subject than the subject of the regulation of passports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.653" offset="5856861">Unless the Court has further questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1438.320" offset="5895522">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.320" offset="5911509">I would like to address myself first to Justice O'Connor's question, what did Congress have in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.798" offset="5953410">I do this before I come to the other aspect of the case, that we are dealing here with a liberty, a liberty recognized by the Court in the cases ranging from Kent to Agee and even Califano, protected by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.151" offset="6034912">But I thought Justice O'Connor's question really was directed to the heart of the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.258" offset="6067303">Congress did not direct itself to the four countries referred to by my good friend the Deputy Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.298" offset="6107427">Congress was concerned about two things:</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.311" offset="6139506">First, the broad power that the President had exercised over the many years which led Congress to pass the statute under consideration, which is not merely the grandfather clause, but the broad statute which included IEEPA, the Economic Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.879" offset="6229785">Congress in doing that was aware of the fact that the proliferated emergencies declared by the President over the years, A, were either outmoded or not justified and, as the administrative spokesman stated to the Congress, particularly the Assistant Treasury Secretary, there was no emergency at the time that Congress was considering IEEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.743" offset="6345246">And as the administrative spokesman said, without an emergency, Mr. Bergsten, the Assistant Secretary of Treasury said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.614" offset="6380668">"We recognize we do not have the powers to carry out the embargoes. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.284" offset="6411388">Therefore, Congress passed this very broad statute which was upheld in IEEPA, in which Congress set forth a procedure bringing the President into the... bringing the Congress into the consultative operations of this statute, because it was concerned with what had been done in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.744" offset="6505220">Now, what the Government is doing here is acting as if all we have to do here is consider what I will consider in a moment, the savings clause, and it forgets the dominant purpose of the legislation, which was to restrict the President, and that the savings clause was, as most savings clauses are, a narrow savings clause for the purpose of preserving something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.854" offset="6629667">And that really is the question, Justice O'Connor: What were they trying to save?</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.030" offset="6894340">And Your Honors will see, for example at page 39 of our brief, when Congressman Bingham observed:</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.088" offset="6950660">"If the President has not used up to now some authority he has under 5(b), I don't know why it should be necessary to give him authority to expand what has already been done. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.255" offset="6995277">And Your Honors will see the references made by Congressmen and by administrative spokesmen which appear at the bottom of page 39 of our brief in footnote 70, when they talk about powers currently operative, not powers inchoate, not powers possessed, powers currently operative; and then when they refer to current employment of controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.666" offset="7112933">This is everything that was said by the various people here, and you do not find any support for the suggestion made by the Government that there is some ambiguity in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.235" offset="7167163">Now, as a matter of fact, as Your Honors will see from our brief, a proposal was made to give the power to the Government, to the executive, under the savings clause, precisely the one which is suggested by my friend here... an old friend, I may say... the power to add new regulations, new controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.196" offset="7279072">And that legislation would have added another paragraph to the existing statute, which is that the President can exercise not only the authorities being exercised, but any other authority conferred upon the President by that section may be exercised to deal with the same set of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.671" offset="7372903">And then came the very important colloquy which came at the end, not in the early stages of the legislation, as the Government suggests, between the leading representative of the Administration, Mr. Bergsten, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, when he was asked:</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.802" offset="7441449">"First of all, Mr. Bergsten, would it be your understanding that Section 101, the grandfather clause, would strictly limit and restrict the grandfathering of powers currently being exercised under 5(b) to those specific uses of the authorities granted in 5(b) being employed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.199" offset="7543013">--it is hard to find...</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.716" offset="7549178">"as of June 1, '77, now July 1? "</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.776" offset="7561403">Mr. Bergsten said: "Yes, sir".</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.414" offset="7567881">And then the question was:</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.400" offset="7575823">"And it would preclude the expansion by the President of the authorities that might be included in 5(b) but are not being employed as of June 1, 1977? "</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.142" offset="7626814">And he says: "That is right".</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.721" offset="7633187">Now, in fact, on July 1, 1977, in reality, forgetting about whether you could travel on this plane or that plane, which is simply a question of mechanics, in reality there was no substantive bar to travel to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.509" offset="7708316">I will take up in a moment this whole conception of general licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.024" offset="7722317">But in fact the realities of the situation were there was no embargo on travel to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.661" offset="7748858">And the Government's petition at page 5, as I recall it, original petition for certiorari, stated what is our view, that the purpose of the savings clause was "to continue an existing embargo".</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.953" offset="7810089">And the question is, was there an embargo on travel to Cuba?</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.357" offset="7827643">There were difficulties, but were those an embargo on travel to Cuba, and the answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.619" offset="7852721">And I would consider this a very telling argument even if it were not dealing with liberty.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="1952.314" offset="7951568">The Government actually has five different theories of what the exercise of authorities means, but let me address myself, which we've talked about in our brief, to the general license theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.136" offset="8002768">The general license is merely a convenient device for withdrawing controls previously in existence, and Your Honors will see that when you look at the China situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.507" offset="8068283">There is a general license exempting China for the most part from the controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.395" offset="8091793">Under the Government theory, whatever the executive is now doing, that general license is a control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.609" offset="8120737">A general license is merely a technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.761" offset="8141321">When you have a broad prohibition, then you decide not to carry out that with respect to particular areas, you have a general license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.211" offset="8175072">And the best illustration would be if I were to take an alternative way to handle the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.959" offset="8198059">If in Section 201, which forbids financial transactions... and I'm assuming for the purpose of this discussion that a man is engaging in a financial transaction with respect to property, although I have some hesitation in accepting that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.545" offset="8260440">The statute, Section 201, could read as follows: All transactions with respect to property in which Cuba has an interest are prohibited, except those relating to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.150" offset="8326895">Now, no one would suggest if the statute, if the regulation had been thus written, that there was an exercise of control over travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.506" offset="8360332">But because it is in the form of a general license, the Government suggests that somehow or other they are giving permission to exercise this liberty of travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.298" offset="8407457">But what they're really doing in the general license technique is withdrawing it, withdrawing the prohibition of travel from the transactional area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.573" offset="8448521">This of course brings to mind Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Dames against Moore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.572" offset="8468583">Dames against Moore... Dames &amp; Moore, excuse me, against Regan was a case in which there was a general license issued and the Government's contention, upheld by the Court... and I may say by me supporting the Government in that case... was that where the President had attached assets, or rather frozen assets, and then released them and allowed them to be subject to attachments, the President by virtue of a later provision was able to... was able to recover the assets and use them the way he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.302" offset="8651441">But in Dames against Moore there was no grandfather clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.631" offset="8676832">We are dealing here with the meaning of the grandfather clause, and the grandfather clause was intended, as the two courts that I referred to indicated, was intended to allow only those prohibitions that were in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.250" offset="8735241">Now, why do I say that it was intended to do that, aside from the language, which is uniform, as Your Honors will see.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.605" offset="8764707">It is precisely because the Congressmen who were in charge of this and the administrative spokesmen recognized that they were attempting to save something, to save the embargoes in existence, and most important, to save the assets which were under embargo, to save those from being given away, because it was recognized there would be dealings with Cuba and with other countries eventually.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.606" offset="8896678">But more than that it is not, because the continuation... and this is the key problem with the Government's position... the continuation under the savings clause of those controls, those embargoes, was not predicated upon an emergency, it was predicated upon a non-emergency, and it is because of that that we have to give a limited interpretation to those words in the savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.312" offset="9023529">Now, when we consider the Government's argument of flexibility, an argument which this Court of course upheld in Dames &amp; Moore, that was flexibility under IEEPA, the Economic Control Act, subject to the control which Congress had and exercised in that real emergency of consultation with the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.100" offset="9126660">Flexibility is of course necessary in foreign relations, and that's why IEEPA was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.206" offset="9163127">Flexibility is not necessary in connection with the savings clause, because the savings clause is based upon a narrow area which cannot be justified on an emergency basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.181" offset="9219029">And Mr. Bergsten recognized and Mr. Katz, from another Department of the Government, in testifying recognized that there might not be constitutional validity even to those things being grandfathered, because there was no emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.442" offset="9276081">So that whether we take the conception of the statute as a whole, it comes down to the question of what was prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.144" offset="9306801">And again, just to remember what we said about general licenses, lest the conceptual thing overlook the reality here, in the China situation, which the Government says it's troubled about answering, in the China situation where there's a general license permitting everything, we could restore that, if we wanted to, under the grandfather clause.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="2384.246" offset="9679202">I do know that the Government made that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.916" offset="9689965">I think we and the courts below, both courts, Courts of Appeals, Eleventh and the First, are of the opinion that if there is a substantive control being exercised by regulation... that may be the thing that was confusing... a substantive control being exercised over travel or over anything, that control could be continued by the grandfather clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.734" offset="9785155">We do not differ with the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.813" offset="9793514">Now, remember what the Government has said, if Your Honors please: We believe that one possible reading of the grandfather clause is... rather an odd way to find a clear-cut statute involving a basic liberty like the right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.762" offset="9857357">The first argument is that if any 5(b) authority is exercised, the Government preserves all 5(b) authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.710" offset="9905109">The second argument is that under any exercise of a 5(b) authority, referring to the statute now, with respect to property, then everything can be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.155" offset="9950876">We pointed out in our answering brief that there was a problem raised with the Government's two views, and the main problem was that with respect to many countries, not merely the four that the Government now targets, although there was no indication they were to be targeted, with respect to many countries there were, A, controls under 5(b) generally and controls over transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.269" offset="10075323">So the Government came back with its general license theory which, as I have indicated, is really a language problem, a semantic problem, rather than dealing with the reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.905" offset="10121925">And with respect to that, I trust Your Honors will look at the House Committee report on this bill, Report No. 95-459, which we cite in our brief, but I regret to say somewhat elliptically, because that House report, in discussing the Cuban situation after it discusses a number of other countries, at page 6 says:</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.079" offset="10270614">"Under the Cuban assets control regulations, all transactions between the United States and Cuba are similarly prohibited. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.370" offset="10303738">--now, there's a comma after that... "with certain exceptions".</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.820" offset="10329547">In other words, they are prohibiting certain things, but the exceptions at that time were travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.239" offset="10371238">Travel, by the way, is separately mentioned by Professor Lowenfeld, who is a leading spokesman, scholarly spokesman at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.030" offset="10410422">Secondly, with respect to the general license, again addressing myself to questions that were put by two of Your Honors, the same page 6 explains my position and the Court of Appeals' position on what it means to have a general license, not that it means that you're permitting, that you're regulating something; it means you're withdrawing it from control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.444" offset="10512090">And here are the words used on page 6:</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.928" offset="10522017">"On May 8, '71, the Department licensed most... most... subsequent transactions with China, while continuing the blocking of China assets in U.S. hands before that date. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.342" offset="10575620">"This had the effect of lifting. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.247" offset="10587218">--I emphasize the word "lifting"...</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.122" offset="10594742">"the United States trade embargo of China. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.666" offset="10620969">Now, if you have lifted an embargo... I think we and the Government, at least theoretically, are in agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.259" offset="10651271">If you have lifted the embargo, then there is no embargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.646" offset="10676871">And there was no embargo on July 1, 1977, after they had lifted the embargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.892" offset="10713860">I have not addressed myself, because I wanted to get to the heart of the problem raised by two of Your Honors in asking questions of Mr. Bator, of other considerations in connection with the statute, and that is what you would have in terms of general tenets of construction rather simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.038" offset="10818454">A savings clause is normally a narrow exception, because you have a broad remedial purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.256" offset="10839248">Here we have a statute which involves liberty of movement, and here you have a statute with very serious criminal sanctions, all of which have been grounds historically for considering savings clauses and all statutes in a narrow way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.622" offset="10912704">But I had omitted one thing, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.012" offset="10922317">After I finished with the general license view, I did... the Government did come in in its answering brief, its reply brief, with a new theory, and that was the one that Mr. Bator quite properly articulated, since it was the newest theory of the Government, namely four countries are being targeted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.937" offset="11025971">Four countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.921" offset="11033912">It's no longer the original theory of 5 being exercised and therefore you could exercise new authorities; no longer the property conception; it's no longer even the licensing thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.947" offset="11082082">The important thing is, Congress had in mind... I can't call it a bill of attainder, having heard yesterday's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.226" offset="11115205">Congress had in mind four countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.991" offset="11126177">Well, this is an odd situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.818" offset="11137566">So you have a flexibility argument that they would recognize, that they insist upon with respect to four countries, and you have another standard, namely non-flexibility with respect to all other countries of the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.938" offset="11193991">Your Honors will read or have read the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.981" offset="11210187">You'll find no theory under which Congress drew a line between "comprehensive embargoes and embargoes generally".</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.072" offset="11246549">Now, as far as IEEPA is concerned, one of course has to ask, not under my theory that perhaps IEEPA couldn't control, but under the Court of Appeals' implied view that IEEPA applies, why the Government doesn't deal, doesn't go under IEEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.409" offset="11335888">They didn't want, the Administration spokesmen and the Congressmen didn't want, for the continuation of the old controls in old situations to have to have an application under IEEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.496" offset="11392208">But IEEPA wa passed for a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.620" offset="11404747">It was passed after at least seven years of study by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.975" offset="11426167">It was passed because that's what Congress wanted when we had a crisis situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.379" offset="11447796">And of course, the Government claims that the current situation is a quasi-emergency or emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.002" offset="11478307">It is a new situation which they say has arisen since 1977, to when a new Administration took effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.639" offset="11512789">Well, if this is a new situation, if this is an emergency, then the Government is supposed to go to the Congress, the President is supposed to go to Congress and consult with the Congress on the IEEPA and put into effect these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.992" offset="11574229">And on their theory that this is a serious problem, this is exactly the thing that Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.144" offset="11602859">Congress didn't intend that when new crises arose that suddenly Congress... the President could disregard the IEEPA procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.280" offset="11651343">Seven years of study went into the drafting of the IEEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.454" offset="11664090">There was a reason for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.763" offset="11669315">And they have not followed that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.371" offset="11683734">This will bring me very briefly to three other points that have been made in our brief and that obviously the Court of Appeals did not decide any of those points, although I think it considered some of them in determining the general interpretation, the narrow interpretation of the savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.519" offset="11776312">The first relates to the 1978 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.516" offset="11792299">The 1978 statute was passed because the Congress was not satisfied, as a matter of fact the Administration wasn't satisfied, to rest merely upon President Carter's removal of bars to travel to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.743" offset="11861263">And the reports of the committees in charge said, we don't want this to depend upon a particular Administration's policies or discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.770" offset="11917374">Great prescience, as we see.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.299" offset="11923434">And they were concerned about liberty of movement, and they said so, and the basic Helsinki general declarations, which are not statutory of course, relating to freedom of movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.139" offset="11978814">Now, the Government says it talks about the Secretary of State and it talks about passports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.494" offset="12012250">Why do we think this has anything to do with this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.836" offset="12025625">Well, the reason we do is because the Congress was concerned about protecting liberty of movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.818" offset="12049553">If it directed its attention to the Secretary of State, it was because that was the normal way in which travel restrictions were imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.658" offset="12084871">And as we argued in Laub, and as we argued in Zemel, as we argued in Kent, the whole history of travel control had been a history in which the Secretary of State was doing his job, controlling it, sometimes we said wrongly sometimes the Court said rightly; and Treasury, if it did anything, was ancillary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3007.585" offset="12172642">Are you saying that none of the restrictions ever issued under the TWEA from the time of its passage had any effect on the control of travel?</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="3015.380" offset="12203780">Your Honor will note that the restrictions were never restrictions by regulation directed specifically to travel, and I have suggested, yes, I have thought that TWEA was never passed to control travel as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.575" offset="12268564">I do recognize that every time the Secretary of State gave a license... sorry, amended a passport... by removing restrictions, the Treasury Department would automatically... and I say automatically... give a license to spend money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.912" offset="12337945">But I have found nothing in the legislative history of TWEA that suggests that that statute really authorized the practice even of the Treasury in connection with licensing.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3062.093" offset="12390608">Well, it authorizes the restriction and control of property in the hands described, and if the regulation affects the property the fact it has an incidental effect on travel doesn't make it illegal under the statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leonard_b_boudin" startTime="3077.574" stopTime="3307.440">
            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="3077.574" offset="12452570">Of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.291" offset="12455392">I haven't suggested that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.915" offset="12457899">I have suggested that historically travel was never contemplated by the Congress, and that each time legislation was proposed to control travel nobody ever mentioned the Treasury Department, nobody ever mentioned TWEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.701" offset="12545044">And this Court in discussing either in Haig or in Laub, in discussing travel controls, recognized that the first travel control statute was a 1918 statute, not the 1970 TWEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.666" offset="12608887">I must say to Your Honor, as I say, we've studied this problem for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.025" offset="12630412">It is a murky area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.586" offset="12640652">I cannot... it's probably the reason why the Court of Appeals did not think it advisable to found its decision upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.893" offset="12677850">Let me address finally the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.439" offset="12700002">I don't want to overlook it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.030" offset="12706376">We raised it, that the Court consider the fact that we are dealing with a liberty to be significant in interpreting the grandfather clause, and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.542" offset="12760397">I would agree... I must agree, having read Agee, having looked at a few other cases of this Court in the travel area and elsewhere... that there are emergency circumstances under which travel could be controlled, forbidden, but not this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.141" offset="12854856">The Court had a very serious nuclear confrontation problem which it addressed, with the consequent dangers to American citizens traveling to Cuba, when I argued Zemel against Rusk, and the Court held there, not that the President could prevent the travel, but it said that the President could not be compelled through the Secretary of State to validate a passport for travel to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.266" offset="12971362">Then came Haig against Agee, the second clear-cut bar on travel, but of an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.328" offset="12999574">And the Court is aware of the stipulations made by Congress and of the findings made in the Chief Justice's opinion with respect to the great danger to foreign relations, to national security, in the possible assassination of CIA agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.323" offset="13067597">Given those facts, I may say, I don't... quite aside from the question of statutory authorization, I don't see how the constitutional power of the Government could be challenged to meet situations such as Haig and Agee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.172" offset="13134993">But what do we have here in reality?</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.562" offset="13144502">We have a hypothetical that if somebody goes to Cuba with his dollars, including these Americans who have never violated any laws at all and who are perfectly good people, if somebody goes to Cuba with his dollars, that money will someday help build a Cuban tourist industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.754" offset="13233318">I'm not an authority on how to build an industry, including a tourist industry, but I suspect it's a long way off between the dollars of American citizens today and building it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.327" offset="13271561">And that industry will make money, and with that money they will eventually be able to subvert Latin America against American interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.042" offset="13310432">Now, I suggest this series of hypotheticals is far too tenuous, particularly in the light of the amount of money which, as we describe in our brief, we are allowing to go to Cuba by the travel that is permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.255" offset="13367274">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="3308.973" offset="13378141">I have a few points I'd like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.769" offset="13389321">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.266" offset="13395277">I think that Mr. Boudin and the Government are in happy agreement on what the central issues are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.217" offset="13419101">The question is what Congress meant by the grandfather clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.480" offset="13436133">That in turn depends crucially on what the situation was in '77 with respect to the authorities being exercised under the TWEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.259" offset="13475316">Mr. Boudin takes this whole bundle of complex authorities, which include the general regulation 201(b), the restricted general license, the fact that that restricted license is subject to revocation and modification, and he just says that all adds up to total deregulation, and he says a general license in general is nothing but an administrative technique for deregulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.358" offset="13583672">But the very first exercise of power to regulate travel-related transactions under the TWEA in 1940 by President Roosevelt, in connection with remittances abroad, to travelers abroad, was by way of a general license and asserted the authority to restrict expenditures over $250 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.581" offset="13680534">If this Court will read its own opinion in Dames &amp; Moore, it will see that there was a general license in that case and it was not simply an administrative technique which receded and said, we are no longer exercising the power to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.403" offset="13739885">It is simply a contingent and subordinate instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.669" offset="13756916">Now, Mr. Boudin read a sentence from the House report which said that in connection with China the structure of the situation did look as if the authority to regulate had been reduced to a very, very narrow point, and that is why we have this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.987" offset="13834239">We are troubled by the question as to what the grandfather clause would have implied for China if that question were still a live question today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.935" offset="13874050">But the very question... the very sentence that Mr. Boudin read you is followed by the following sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.591" offset="13900590">After</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.980" offset="13906232">"this had the effect of lifting the U.S. trade embargo of China. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.353" offset="13919712">it then goes on and says:</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.914" offset="13929952">"However, the embargoes of North Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Cuba continue. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.914" offset="13949909">"Second. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.271" offset="13955343">the report continues,</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.425" offset="13959940">"under the Cuban assets control regulations all transactions between the United States and Cuba are similarly prohibited, with certain exceptions. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.392" offset="13999855">That is, the structure that is suggested here is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.250" offset="14019290">It's suggested that the general regulation continues, but subject to exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.823" offset="14049592">It's not a statement about deregulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.464" offset="14060146">Mr. Boudin objects to the fact that we think the fair reading of the legislative history targets these four countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.086" offset="14094627">The very last thing Mr. Bingham said on the floor of the House was that "This legislation"... that is, that he said about the grandfather clause was, he says on the floor of the House:</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.330" offset="14143633">"This legislation specifically grandfathers the embargoes against Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Cuba, and other existing embargoes, so that they are not affected in any way by this legislation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.652" offset="14192848">The one he dropped from there was North Korea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.058" offset="14202461">So it is targeted, and he says they are not affected in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.150" offset="14226912">Now, one further quick point, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.194" offset="14251049">The Congress I think was persuaded in 1977 that these four situations were extraordinary and that special powers needed to be maintained to allow the President to conduct a credible and serious foreign policy with respect to these four extraordinary situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.624" offset="14340805">It's the statute that says that the President does not need to make a new emergency declaration in connection with these four embargoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.791" offset="14385423">That doesn't mean that our relations with these countries have not and cannot from time to time reach very acute and difficult circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.944" offset="14421994">The fact that the President has not formally declared a new state of emergency with Cuba has no probative effect on what is the state of our relations with Cuba as long as it is true, as the President was persuaded is true, that he has authority to continue to administer these embargo systems because of the extraordinary situation that persists with these four countries.</text>

            <text syncTime="3602.446" offset="14552084">Apart from these four countries, just in other parts of the world, as I understand it there are certain kinds of property transactions that are prohibited by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.299" offset="14595447">And are those prohibitions also pursuant to the TWEA, and if so to what extent do they survive and is there any flexibility under your theory for changes in those?</text>

            <text syncTime="3624.809" offset="14641527">Your Honor, there are very special and specific prohibitions, there were in '77 under TWEA, with respect to the export of what I believe are described as strategic items to certain countries.</text>
