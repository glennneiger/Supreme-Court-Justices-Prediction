            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149648">We will hear arguments next in Flanagan v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.592" offset="183921">Mr. Rubenstone, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Edward H. Rubenstone</label>
            <text syncTime="13.402" offset="203251">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.510" offset="211610">Some 40 years ago in Adams v. United States this Court cautioned that the procedural safeguards provided to an accused by the Constitution must not be turned into fetters and recognized that to deny a criminal defendant in the exercise of his free choice the right to dispense with the constitutional safeguards which have been provided for his protection is to imprison a man in his privileges and call it the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.246" offset="354552">If the decisions below disqualifying Petitioners' counsel of choice from presenting their common defense at trial are permitted to stand, the caution so perceptively expressed by Justice Frankfurter will become a reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.472" offset="427486">This Court has repeatedly confirmed both the propriety and the efficacy of multiple representation in criminal matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.640" offset="468133">This Court has never questioned the right of persons accused of crimes jointly to present their common defense through counsel of their choice, and this Court has expressly recognized that a defendant has the right to determine the manner in which his case shall be conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.770" offset="564681">If the decisions below are permitted to stand these precepts will not survive in any meaningful form.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.767" offset="604701">This case presents in the clearest possible terms the question of whether four police officers jointly charged will be permitted to determine that they wish to have their defense presented by one lawyer in whom they have great trust and great confidence, that they have the right to determine that the one lawyer shall present a common defense, and that their decision is based upon the fact that their positions are completely and totally consistent and that each is willing to waive their rights to separate counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.015" offset="781707">In this case four police officers learned in the spring of 1981 from newspaper articles that they were under investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.979" offset="829563">They were under investigation by various federal, local and police authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.039" offset="857775">They were confronted with this tangle of legal complexities.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.506" offset="875643">Civil and criminal potential was facing them, and they made the decision at that time to come to the firm of Sprague and Rubenstone, in particular to come to the firm because of the firm's senior partner, Richard Sprague, who is a highly skilled and experienced defense lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.264" offset="942621">They came to the firm and they said to the firm</text>
            <text syncTime="202.231" offset="958504">"We are coming to you as a group. "</text>
            <text syncTime="204.308" offset="966863">"We have common interests and we want you to protect them. "</text>
            <text syncTime="207.869" offset="981073">After they came each of the defendants was interviewed individually, and it was determined as a result of these individual interviews that the facts which they related were not inculpatory to them, were not inculpatory to any other defendant and indeed were consistent among themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.623" offset="1256090">No, I must assume the possibility with all due respect that there may be evidence which the government believes demonstrates wrongdoing, but I need not assume that there will be evidence of guilt nor need I assume in making my determination as to whether or not I can represent all four that anything they tell me is incorrect unless I have something to present me with a doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.691" offset="1360371">In this entire proceeding I think it is important to note since the time of the Rule 44 disqualification hearing right up to today there has been not one shred of evidence, not one piece of information presented by the government which gives any claim to any assertion that they might make that there is anything inconsistent as between the stories which the defendants tell.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward H. Rubenstone</label>
            <text syncTime="338.803" offset="1504776">Let me turn to it very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.286" offset="1514703">The decision to disqualify counsel is a final and irrevocable decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.002" offset="1545632">It has an immediate and an intense impact upon the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.172" offset="1566321">It has an immediate and intense impact upon the defendants and every action which they take during the entire course of the trial, and it destroys ultimately and utterly the defendants' right to counsel at the most critical stage of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.227" offset="1626507">As a result to use the language of Cohen, the decision to disqualify counsel is too important and too independent to defer review.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.628" offset="1676139">Now if we turn to the specific test which was laid out in Cohen and in Cooper I think it is clear that of the three-prong test for appealability as a collateral order the disqualification of counsel decision meets the first two.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.699" offset="1756388">It is a decision which conclusively determines the question, and it is a decision which is totally separate and apart from any question involving the guilt or innocence of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.771" offset="1808632">The only area which I think does raise some discussion is the question of whether or not the decision to disqualify counsel is effectively reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.610" offset="1864012">Seven circuits have passed on this issue both in the criminal and in the civil context, and each of them has rejected the argument that such a decision is effectively reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.884" offset="1929109">Basically every court including the Ninth Circuit which has said that this is not an order which is appealable in an interlocutory fashion has said any attempt to prove prejudice by a defendant who has his counsel denied to him at the inception of the case would be an insurmountable burden and we cannot imagine any way that he could go about showing that, meeting that burden.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="471.561" stopTime="480.589">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="471.561" offset="2035793">Well, I suppose if some per se reversal rule were adopted you would not have difficulty.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_h_rubenstone" startTime="480.588" stopTime="598.370">
            <label>Mr. Edward H. Rubenstone</label>
            <text syncTime="480.588" offset="2071947">That is what the Ninth Circuit said in Greger, Justice O'Connor, and I do have a difficulty with per se reversal because there is too much which can occur during the course of a trial which is not reversable.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.940" offset="2149374">There is too much that can occur during the course of a trial which is irremediable and which is denied to a defendant if he is forced to go to trial with counsel other than his choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.388" offset="2211127">For example, at a trial, the first trial, a lot of people are going to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.337" offset="2238921">Now subsitute counsel may be competent, but he may not be the counsel that the defendant selects, and his ability to direct or cross examine that witness may not be the same level as the ability of counsel of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.267" offset="2322618">Likewise the strategy or the tactics which he might adopt in cross examining or direct examining that witness may have been different and may have been injurious to the interests of that defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.230" offset="2390536">Now if that witness is subsequently unavailable his testimony is admissible in the event of a retrial, and I submit that that is prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.537" offset="2435780">The very decision as to whether or not the defendant will testify may be made one way by counsel of choice, may be made the exact opposite way by substitute counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.188" offset="2494399">If substitute counsel decides to put that man on the stand and have him testify then his testimony is going to be forever etched in stone, and that will not be reversable.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="598.370" offset="2543091">Mr. Rubenstone, the Cobbledick case says that the policy especially in criminal cases is against piecemeal appeals, and there is no doubt that an appeal like this first in the court of appeals and conceivably here if certiorari is granted does delay the start of the criminal trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.565" offset="2619891">Yes, especially if, as has occurred in this case, the District Court entered a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.046" offset="2653746">I do not think that there is necessarily an automatic stay as a result of an appeal under 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.387" offset="2679137">Somebody has got to stay the proceedings, and I think that at that point there is a certain degree of discretion in both the district court and the court of appeals as to whether or not this is a matter which does require review or whether this is a matter which is frivolous.</text>

            <text syncTime="1857.818" offset="7580858">Let me just... To be very clear a lot of the actual conflict cases involving disqualification of counsel have arisen involving third parties and a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.812" offset="7624848">There I do not believe that it is essential that the district court disqualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.294" offset="7646791">In those instances I think Rule 44 tells the district court to take appropriate measures, and a lot of the circuits have gone around and done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.712" offset="7684407">For example, where there is problems of the attorney-client privilege of a prior client, the Second Circuit, the Eight Circuit has said</text>

            <text syncTime="1904.391" offset="7767163">They have gone to extremes to avoid the extreme action that was taken by the court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.935" offset="7809377">That is not directly analogous here obviously because it involves third parties, but I think it does indicate that appropriate measures under Rule 44 is not some kind of reflexive disqualification if you have a problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1938.003" offset="7901641">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.422" offset="7931317">I would like first by way of background to ask that the Court in thinking about disqualification issues keep in mind that joint representation of codefendants is not the only context in which this issue can arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.213" offset="7990458">There are other cases in which a defense lawyer can be disqualified including a successive representation situation where the lawyer formally represented a person who is now a prosecution witness, situations where the lawyer formally was a prosecutor who had some arguable connection with the investigation that led to the indictment of his now client, situations where the third party is paying the fees and exercising some degree of control over the representation of the defendant, and even we've seen cases where there is the lawyer's potential involvement in the underlying offense or his potential role as a witness which may call for his disqualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.243" offset="8162552">Now I would like to say just a few words now about the jurisdictional issue and come back to it later if I have time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.896" offset="8197139">I think the first thing I would like to say is that if I was told that we could win only one of the two issues in this case we would rather win the jurisdictional issue and lose the merits issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.905" offset="8245204">Now the reason for this position is the potentially devastating effects of delay in criminal prosecutions as this Court has repeatedly recognized in Cobbledick, DiBella, Hollywood Motor Cars and other cases in which it has turned down interlocutory defense appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.102" offset="8318033">This case illustrates the potential damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.194" offset="8334334">The alleged victims in this case are street people who are hard to locate... We hope we will still be able to locate them... who are hard to... whose will to testify against the police when they have to go back on the street again is sometimes hard to nerve them up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.369" offset="8455124">There are problems that are caused by the delay in this and in other cases, and those problems are an important part of the reason why in criminal cases it is only on the strongest most compelling kind of showing that the court should permit a pretrial appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.409" offset="8531192">There is also I might add--</text>

            <text syncTime="2100.827" offset="8552926">If we were to agree with your friend and agree with his proposition would it mean that in a Faretta case after the judge had conducted a hearing on the qualifications of the defendant to act as his own counsel and then decided that he was not qualified and appointed standby, would that be appealable?</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="2130.300" offset="8670791">--Well, Justice O'Connor asked that of my colleague, and I think the answer is clearly that would not be appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.595" offset="8692002">The reason that would not be appealable is I think it is quite clear that there would have to be an automatic reversal for a Faretta violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.950" offset="8729410">That is the kind of violation that does not call for an analysis of specific prejudice in the trial of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.712" offset="8760443">Therefore, it would be treated as effectively reviewable on appeal and, therefore, it would not meet one of the requirements of interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.911" offset="8805269">So I would say that that, or we have situations where a defendant seeks appointment of counsel claiming that he is indigent and is denied by the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3401.679" offset="13756309">Well, it can have fatal consequences because the lawyer is often nominally his lawyer but actually... As I say this is not this case at all but it is a class of circumstances that we have to be concerned about with he waiver.</text>

            <text syncTime="3428.855" offset="13864979">It may come close to saying that if the district court... That is I think the decision that underlies Rule 44(c) which is designed not if a conflict actually exists but if there is any possibility or likelihood that a conflict will arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.380" offset="13935091">Now if you had... There are cases in which it can be imagined where the likelihood of conflict is a great deal less than in this case and where joint representation might be permitted, and I think the district court could take into account in dealing with people just above the indigency line, the kinds of economies that you are concerned about in deciding when it is dealing with a potential conflict in assessing how serious it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.979" offset="14049508">It has the discretion to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.383" offset="14059121">I am not sure what the answer is except that the principles of the bar are very much against this kind of representation of trying to serve people who may have conflicting interests at the same time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3496.704" offset="14136443">Mr. Frey, what can the district judge to in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.828" offset="14152952">Of course, he has disqualified him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.015" offset="14157655">Assuming he let the lawyer represent one of the four on the theory that you do not have to all get out and the other three say</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.153" offset="14182210">"Well, I'll exercise my Faretta rights. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.809" offset="14188792">and just assume that generally that the lawyer for the one defendant will keep things in hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.214" offset="14210422">Is there any way that the judge can prevent that so that there would end up with being just one lawyer on the defense side of the table?</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="3522.850" offset="14241037">No, I suppose if the judge... I mean, my first reaction to that question is that the judge probably could not prevent that although he would then have to make special efforts to try to get them to explain or make sure that they understand that at least they can consult with a lawyer after which they may choose to go forward with their joint defense, but it would be quite strange for them to be even unwilling to talk to another lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.290" offset="14374784">Now there is the problem in these cases of the figure behind the arras, the third party paying the fees, and that is a factor in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.130" offset="14406131">The fee is being paid by a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.099" offset="14413968">There is no assurance that if one of these defendants wished to cooperate with the government that their fees would any longer be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.923" offset="14445315">That was not the ground of the disqualification in this case, but it is a source of concern in many of these conflict cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.592" offset="14483976">Also we have another interest because my colleague said that if in the course of a trial a conflict emerged, a actual conflict, he would naturally have to disqualify himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.696" offset="14532355">Well, we have an interest in not having that happen in the middle of a trial, and the District Court has an interest in not having that happen in the middle of a trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3617.063" offset="14617828">That is probably what it would lead to if you had one lawyer in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.718" offset="14632456">There is no way to prevent as you mentioned earlier the claim later on that the waiver of conflict free counsel was either coerced or not intelligent or the product of ineffective assistance on the part of the lawyer with the conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.321" offset="14702882">It is impossible to predict what will occur during the trial, and it is very difficult for the judge who knows the detail of neither the prosecution's case nor the defense case to be the agency for making sure that the defendants really appreciate the risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.688" offset="14772368">Even defense counsel cannot necessarily appreciate the risks because they do not know what the government's evidence xx--</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.701" offset="14800371">This concern about... I mean it is said here that this is nothing but a potential conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.402" offset="14823255">There is no actual conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.823" offset="14828897">There is not going to be any conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.620" offset="14836107">Yet here we have a situation where Flanagan was out on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.618" offset="14860035">According to the severance motion the other three defendants were in places of hiding from which they could not see what was happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.988" offset="14889501">They responded only to Flanagan's signal and, therefore, they could not be accused of having illegally arrested the victims in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.625" offset="14944045">Yet I understand that in other court proceedings these same people have testified that they were in a position to see Flanagan being mugged by the victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.417" offset="14983228">Now from Flanagan's standpoint that is much better evidence if that could be and would be their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.663" offset="15020218">From the standpoint of the other three defendants it is obviously much better that they were off around the corner and could not see.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.412" offset="15051251">Now I do not know how one lawyer develops a strategy that deals with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.782" offset="15076747">In the charges of assaults in these cases the witnesses may be able to clearly identify some, poorly identify others and not at all identify yet others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.496" offset="15123558">How does one lawyer represent all these defendants fairly?</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.808" offset="15144874">Now the question is... I think part of the argument is well maybe he cannot but the defendants have the right to waiver their right to fair and effective representation, conflict-free representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.693" offset="15200358">Now this question came up before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.020" offset="15209658">Where does this right to have a lawyer come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.986" offset="15221570">Where did the Faretta right come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.251" offset="15230556">The Faretta right came from the Sixth Amendment, but it did not the Court said come from the assistance of counsel clause of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.466" offset="15263470">This situation is really like Singer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.386" offset="15283114">You have a right to conflict-free counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.728" offset="15304535">It does not mean that you have the right to insist on counsel burdened with a conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.351" offset="15327000">I do not think in short that the right that we are talking about is a right of such a magnitude that it overrides the normal principles that govern the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.938" offset="15385305">The small restriction on the eligibility... This is essentially an eligibility requirement that Rule 44(c) has allowed the District Court to impose upon lawyers practicing in the district that they not undertake representation where there is a conflict of interest or a potential conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.493" offset="15459597">I do not see how that small additional restriction can raise a serious constitutional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.429" offset="15483317">Thank you.</text>
