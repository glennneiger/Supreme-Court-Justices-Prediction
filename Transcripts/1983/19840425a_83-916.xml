            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="125278">We will hear arguments next in United States against Morton.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.737" offset="152132">Mr. McConnell, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_w_mc_connell" startTime="12.058" stopTime="135.520">
            <label>Mr. Michael W. Mc Connell</label>
            <text syncTime="12.058" offset="173448">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.281" offset="226320">The issue in this case is whether the United States in its capacity as employer and garnishee is required to reimburse an employee for sums deducted from his paycheck in compliance with the facially valid state court writ of garnishment enforcing a judgment for alimony and child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.529" offset="307299">The state court subsequently was found not to have had personal jurisdiction over the employee respondent here in the underlying divorce proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.337" offset="350558">The legal framework under which this case arises is a federal garnishment statute, 42 USC 659, which waives federal sovereign immunity and subjects federal agencies to suit in the capacity as garnishee to enforce alimony and child support in like manner and to the same extent as any private garnishee and which expressly immunizes the United States from liability for honoring any legal process regular on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.193" offset="494022">The facts of this case are quite simple when viewed from the perspective of a federal disbursing officer whose only responsibility is to ensure that the garnishment writ is regular on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.519" offset="551283">In August, 1975, respondent's wife obtained a divorce, including alimony and child support, pursuant to a default judgment in Alabama state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.577" offset="599557">Over a year later, in December, 1975, the Air Force Finance Office at Elmundorf Air Base in Alaska was served a writ of garnishment to collect arrearages in Colonel Morton's obligations under the divorce decree.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="135.520" offset="667267">You left out that he was served on the case itself from Alabama by mail.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_w_mc_connell" startTime="142.693" stopTime="1372.943">
            <label>Mr. Michael W. Mc Connell</label>
            <text syncTime="142.693" offset="696001">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.325" offset="702480">The Air Force Finance Office received two documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.179" offset="721915">It received a writ of garnishment and it received a copy of the underlying judgment of divorce issued by the Alabama state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.552" offset="755456">The disbursing officer attached... assigned to the case applied the usual procedures in processing it, examining the document to make sure that it was one that qualified under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.843" offset="808641">He looked first to see if it was issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.930" offset="824942">In this case, the writ was issued by the Tenth Judicial Circuit Court of the state of Alabama, which is a court of general jurisdiction, and unquestionably is a court competent to issue a writ of garnishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.554" offset="871440">He checked second to see if the writ was to enforce an order for child support or alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.125" offset="901742">Since the federal garnishment statute does not permit garnishment for other purposes, such as rent or commercial loans or the like, it is necessary to make sure that it is for child support or alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.033" offset="949389">In this case, the face of the writ revealed that the sums were being sought for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.253" offset="974258">Third, he checked to see if the writ was in the proper form, and as the trial court found as a fact, the writ of garnishment was in the proper form, the usual form used by the state of Alabama for writs of garnishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.612" offset="1031622">And finally, the officer examined the writ to see if there were any irregularities on the face of the writ which would suggest invalidity under state or federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.487" offset="1071224">Now, I mentioned that there were two documents served on the Air Force.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.939" offset="1088987">The other document was a copy of the judgment of divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.426" offset="1106960">Now, in this instance that document was not necessary for the processing of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.580" offset="1131515">Under the regulations of the Office of Personnel Management which implement this statute, it is necessary to file a copy of the underlying decree only when the writ itself does not make plain whether it was for child support and alimony alone, which is not uncommon, since some writs of garnishment do not specify the nature of the underlying obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.564" offset="1235482">In this case, as I have said, the writ itself indicated that it was for child support or alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.385" offset="1258783">Thus the second document was not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.001" offset="1269232">Nonetheless, it is worth noting that a copy of the judgment of divorce was also regular on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.407" offset="1298803">There are no irregularities apparent on the face of the document that would suggest invalidity, and in the first line of the judgment of divorce, it states that respondent was duly served and failed to appear in the divorce proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.035" offset="1365363">Upon receiving the writ, the finance office promptly notified Colonel Morton, who then sought legal advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.372" offset="1398695">Upon the advice of counsel, Colonel Morton protested the garnishment to the finance office on several grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.628" offset="1427743">First, he claimed that he had in fact been satisfying on a regular monthly basis his obligations for divorce and alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.834" offset="1468599">Second, he claimed that he was neither domiciled in nor a resident of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.305" offset="1490437">And third, he claimed that he had not been properly served in the divorce proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.624" offset="1511753">Since none of these matters went to the question of the regularity of the writ on its face, the disbursing officer answered the writ and subsequently deducted the sums owing to Mrs. Morton and paid them over to the registry of the Alabama court.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.134" offset="1573716">Colonel Morton did not then nor has he at any time since challenged the state court judgment in the Alabama courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.740" offset="1608197">This is in spite of the fact that the notice which was provided him by the Air Force expressly informed him that he might have defenses to the underlying action, advised him to seek legal counsel, and informed him that the United States would not be asserting his defenses for him in the garnishment action.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.368" offset="1682698">In fact, Colonel Morton did seek advice of counsel from not one but two attorneys, and on their advice he chose not to challenge the underlying action.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.407" offset="1722822">The position of the government on these facts is straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.128" offset="1741735">The garnishment writ was regular on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.246" offset="1754169">Colonel Morton's arguments, whether he had paid his obligations, whether the court's recital that he had been duly served was accurate, and whether he had had sufficient contacts with Alabama to justify jurisdiction were beyond the ken of disbursing officers and beyond their powers and responsibilities under the statute and implementing regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.827" offset="1840582">The Air Force was required in like manner and to the same extent, no more, no less than any private garnishee to comply with the state court legal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.301" offset="1886454">Now, the facts and legal principles applicable to this case when viewed from respondent's position, that is, looking to see whether there was in fact personal jurisdiction over Colonel Morton in that underlying divorce proceeding, are considerably more complicated, and I will leave those facts for opposing counsel to develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.929" offset="1964925">Suffice it to say that the courts below found it necessary to determine and to rely upon the following facts among others.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.654" offset="2003796">They looked at where Colonel Morton voted.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.355" offset="2014662">They looked at where he paid taxes and why.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.057" offset="2029500">They looked at where he registered his automobile, why he used his moving allowance to send his family to Alabama, what his subjective intentions were when he moved to Alaska, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.448" offset="2082999">Just a recital of some of these facts should indicate that these are not the facts which are within the ordinary purview of the disbursing officer paying out federal salaries, but even after the facts had been established by the trial court below, the able judges of the federal circuit were not able to agree on the legal conclusions to be given those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.480" offset="2175159">They in fact split on a two to one vote on the question of whether the Alabama divorce court did have jurisdiction over Colonel Morton, but of course the majority on the panel did conclude that the Alabama court had erred on the question of its own jurisdiction, and that the Air Force should have refused to honor the Alabama writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.911" offset="2256870">This case is thus a perfect illustration of why Congress limited the responsibility of the federal disbursing agents to determining whether the writ is regular on its face, and why it makes neither practical nor legal sense to put the federal government at the risk of double payment when the disbursing officer honors a state court order at risk on facts that the officer has no means of knowing, and on legal determinations that the officer has no authority or capacity to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.782" offset="2380377">It puts the federal government at risk that a federal court may subsequently decide that a facially valid state court order which the employee himself had chosen not to challenge at the time had been erroneously entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.023" offset="2437324">The practical effect on the federal government is plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.077" offset="2453520">Respondent's theory subjects the government unfairly to double liability even where it has performed all of the actions that the law requires, but the practical effect on the Congressional scheme in the garnishment statute is equally important.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.003" offset="2513288">Congress passed the garnishment statute in 1974 for the express purpose of providing a rapid and convenient means whereby former spouses and children could obtain enforcement of child support and alimony judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.679" offset="2575982">It was based expressly on the findings by Congress that then existing remedies were inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.000" offset="2601268">In fact, after hearings and considerable investigation, Congress concluded that the failure of the system to provide adequate enforcement of child support and alimony orders were a major contributing cause to poverty and to the welfare problem, finding that there were large numbers of affluent and middle class fathers who simply abandoned their families and did not comply with the orders, leaving their families dependent upon public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.888" offset="2724775">The legislative history shows that Congress intended for garnishment writs to be honored on the basis of the state court order or decision alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.844" offset="2764586">It did not impose any other conditions precedent to the payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.648" offset="2783812">But under the holding of the court below, the government will be forced to take steps to protect itself from double liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.152" offset="2813800">Each of these possible alternative steps would erect an additional and unintended obstacle to the Congressional purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.990" offset="2845147">There are three basic alternatives that the government faces in an instance where there is some doubt about the underlying jurisdiction of the court that entered the original judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.500" offset="2899273">Now, respondent suggests, and this was also the alternative mentioned by the court below, that the government simply refused to comply with any garnishment writ where the employee has claimed that the jurisdictional basis of the underlying decree is defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.145" offset="2973774">But the effect of this would be to unilaterally deny the benefits of this statute to the spouses and children to whom Congress intended that they be present, and it would relegate them to the very remedies that Congress had found inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.673" offset="3047962">Now, I realize that the court below, echoed by respondent in his brief in this Court, are considerably more upbeat about those remedies that Congress had considered and found inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.564" offset="3095505">I don't propose to go into that particular debate, because for purposes of interpreting what Congress intended for this statute, it matters only that Congress drew the conclusion that those remedies were inadequate, and it is manifestly contrary to the Congressional purposes to enable a federal disbursing officer because of his unilateral doubts about a state court process to deny those benefits to the spouses and children Congress intended to assist.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.171" offset="3233954">But all of this is even assuming that the United States, having agreed to be subject in like manner and to the same extent as any private garnishee to garnishment writs would be free to disregard a facially valid and binding state court order, a matter which we consider highly dubious on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.769" offset="3324338">The more likely alternative here is that the government's explanation for refusing to honor a writ would be treated as an answer or return under state law, but this would then put the government in the position of litigating against the spouse and children who were the intended beneficiaries of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.933" offset="3412945">They would be litigating against the spouse and children in state court on behalf of the employee concerning the validity of the underlying divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.389" offset="3450770">I can imagine few roles which are less appropriate for the United States government than for it to be litigating on one side in state court of a marital dispute, and it would turn the purpose of the garnishment statute on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.631" offset="3511792">Congress intended to make it easier for spouses and children to collect their alimony and child support rights, and instead, under the judgment of the court below, the government would be enlisted as their opponent in collecting those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.010" offset="3581278">The final alternative which in my view is the most likely in the long run if the judgment below were affirmed is that the United States would be forced to file interpleader actions in federal court to resolve who would be entitled to receive the employee's salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.888" offset="3648778">This would indeed get the United States off the hook for double liability, but there is very little else in the procedure that commends it.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.827" offset="3684514">First of all, the spouse and children would be forced to litigate their rights a second time in a more expensive forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.933" offset="3717010">Secondly, it would not even benefit the employee, the working spouse, since he would be required to litigate as well, most likely in the very state where the spouse and children are living, which was the very thing which he is trying to avoid through all of this, and the federal courts would be inundated with numerous new interpleader actions, in each one of which the question would be whether a state court divorce decree had been properly entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.452" offset="3839054">Neither the purpose of the statute nor any other sensible public policy would be promoted by this course of events.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.641" offset="3871760">But the results are not required, we submit, by the statute under the plain language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.414" offset="3906868">Section 659(a) subjects the United States to exactly the same obligations as are imposed on private garnishees, yet private garnishees are not required to second guess state court judgments or to litigate on behalf of the principal debtors.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.208" offset="3974055">It is well established under the law of virtually every jurisdiction that the duty of a garnishee to his creditor is simply to give notice of the action, no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.981" offset="4017105">Even more clearly, Section 659(f) immunizes the government from liability for honoring a legal process that is regular on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.658" offset="4067887">That seems plain enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.491" offset="4075201">The writ here, the garnishment writ was regular on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.210" offset="4090039">The government should not be held liable for having honored it.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.514" offset="4103309">To reach its contrary conclusion, the court of appeals took a rather roundabout route of interpretation, holding that because the term "legal process" is defined in the statute to be, among other things, process which is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, and then holding that the term "competent jurisdiction" necessarily means both personal and subject matter jurisdiction, the court came to the conclusion that a garnishment writ is not legal process regular on its face if the underlying judgment had been entered without personal jurisdiction over the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.453" offset="4255028">Well, there are at least three flaws in this analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.174" offset="4269970">First, it fails to read the phrase</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.725" offset="4284076">"legal process regular on its face. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.244" offset="4294212">as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.244" offset="4298182">It yanks the term "legal process" away from its context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.279" offset="4314378">In context, it seems apparent that those attributes of being legal process should be matters that are discernible from the face of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.354" offset="4358682">Otherwise, the words "on its face" would effectively have no meaning in the context of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.758" offset="4384282">Second, the Court of Appeals focused on the wrong court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.145" offset="4401836">The statute provides immunity for the United States for complying with legal process that was issued by a court of competent jurisdiction under the definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.351" offset="4442587">The legal process that the United States complied with was the garnishment writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.071" offset="4461500">The question should be whether the court that issued that writ was competent to do so, not whether a divorce judgment which was underlying that degree was issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.914" offset="4516880">Now, the garnishment court is in some senses an ancillary proceeding to the underlying judgment, but for jurisdictional purposes it is a new action which is brought by the plaintiff, Mrs. Morton, against the garnishee, the United States, as the defendant, and there is no question that the Tenth Judicial Circuit Court of Alabama was a court of competent jurisdiction to issue this garnishment writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.029" offset="4621369">Whether or not the Alabama court properly had jurisdiction to issue a divorce is simply beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.635" offset="4651776">The third flaw in the Court of Appeals' analysis is that it assumes a definition of competent jurisdiction that is quite unnecessary and is inconsistent with the context in which it is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.645" offset="4707782">Competent jurisdiction is a term which frequently is used to mean subject matter jurisdiction alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.382" offset="4734741">It deals with the question of whether a court is competent to issue a particular type of order in a particular class of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.905" offset="4768805">Now, in order to tell whether it has that definition or the more expansive definition, it is necessary to look at the term in context, and since in context it is apparent that it should be a matter which is discernible on the face of the writ, it is plain that the Court of appeals drew a conclusion which was unnecessary and in fact inconsistent with some of the other terms in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.037" offset="4865353">Now, the Court of Appeals apparently reached the tortured conclusion out of a fear that a contrary construction of the garnishment statute would violate Colonel Morton's due process rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.613" offset="4919688">We submit that there are no due process problems that would demand a non-literal interpretation of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.350" offset="4946646">Colonel Morton's due process rights may well have been violated by the Alabama divorce judgment, assuming that the Alabama courts in fact lacked personal jurisdiction over him, but that, of course, is true whenever a court erroneously exercises jurisdiction over a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.014" offset="5025327">Colonel Morton received notice of the divorce proceeding and made a deliberate tactical judgment not to defend his rights in that forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.418" offset="5058868">He could have made a special appearance to contest jurisdiction in the Alabama court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.072" offset="5081542">He could have done so even after the initial entering of the final judgment, since he could do so in the course of defending the garnishment order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.379" offset="5118741">And indeed because he is a serviceman, Colonel Morton has remedies that are available far in excess of those available to other citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.235" offset="5158134">Under the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act, all he had to do was to send a letter to the Alabama state court, and he could have procured a stay of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.024" offset="5197317">He could have obtained another look at the judgment even after it had been entered, or he could have obtained the appointment of a guardian at litum for him in the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.815" offset="5240471">But instead, on advice of counsel, Colonel Morton did nothing to protect his rights, and even today Colonel Morton has remedies that are available to him if his due process rights have been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.872" offset="5292716">He would be able to cut off any future garnishments by simply defending against one of the garnishments on the basis of this alleged jurisdictional defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.030" offset="5337334">He also has the ability to sue plaintiff, who after all received the moneys that we are saying were illegally or unconstitutionally taken from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.572" offset="5379547">But nothing in the due process clause entitles Colonel Morton to shift the losses of his legal tactics onto his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.826" offset="5412566">The United States is simply a stakeholder in this dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.629" offset="5427717">We have complied with facially valid and legally binding state court process, as we are required to do under statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.366" offset="5458646">It is not our responsibility to assert respondent's rights in court or to make him whole again if the state court erred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.072" offset="5493546">There is no violation of due process for a third party to rely in good faith on a facially valid state court judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.495" offset="5527191">Thus, we submit that the judgment below should be reversed, because it is contrary to the plain language of the garnishment statute, because it produces an absurd result directly contrary to the legislative intent, because the result is not required by due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.056" offset="5593438">Unless this Court has some questions to ask of me, I will reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1402.629" offset="5735753">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.929" offset="5736902">This is a military pay case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.915" offset="5744844">It involves the interpretation of a federal statute and how it is supposed to be administered by the military services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.569" offset="5779534">This case does not in any way affect the Alabama court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.805" offset="5796462">It does not modify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.555" offset="5803462">It does not hold it void.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.724" offset="5812135">It does not say anything to Alabama and to the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.959" offset="5825092">All it says to it is, you may not enforce it in this manner simply because it does not qualify under the definitions set forth in the federal statute, which is 42 USC 659 and 662, because that was amended in 1977 for the sole reason of clarifying this statute, as Senator Nunn made it clear when he argued for this amendment on the floor of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.597" offset="5947658">Since that is true, we have to look... this is not a man that is trying to escape liability as you have heard about so many times, and you have heard them talk about the reason for this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.107" offset="6013696">Not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.559" offset="6019443">He kept right on paying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.325" offset="6026548">This man kept on voluntarily paying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.427" offset="6038982">After he had paid once in Leudon County, and after he had... after Mrs. Morton had gone to Alabama, and after he had one of the children with him, the other one was married and over the age of 18, he still kept on paying something to her pursuant to their initial agreement between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.674" offset="6111916">Let's look at this a little bit more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.626" offset="6123724">Not all military people involved in these things are colonels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.161" offset="6141905">They are not all in the situation that Colonel Morton is in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.482" offset="6159146">Some of them, and very recently, have been in combat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.117" offset="6177745">These people in Grenada, these people in Beirut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.088" offset="6193627">And there is going to be more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.388" offset="6202822">We cannot say that we are always going to have peace in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.492" offset="6219227">But what they are really saying to him is, and to every soldier and military man is, you have got to tell your commanding officer, time, sir, stop the war, I have got to go home and fight a divorce case, because the ex-wife remarries, commingles her property with the husband, his tenants buy the entirety, and where is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.523" offset="6315358">Now, they have admitted at Page 6 of the reply brief that Colonel Morton's pay was indeed taken without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.129" offset="6357781">The only basis of this, of course, would be the lack of in personum jurisdiction, and we are talking about what are legal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.687" offset="6403965">Now, he is arguing on this statute before it came into... before the amendments came into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.441" offset="6431028">When the amendments came into effect, it put certain definitions in this statute, and this definition makes all the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.761" offset="6464256">He says it is only the writ that we may look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.797" offset="6476377">Then why in the world would Congress have said, payments to provide for health care, education, recreation, clothing, and to meet other specific needs of such child or children, such term also includes attorney fees, interest, and court costs when and to the extent that the same are expressly recoverable as such, pursuant to a decree, order, or judgment issued in accordance with the applicable state law by a court of competent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.934" offset="6600929">Does that mean the garnishment writ?</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.720" offset="6608138">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.703" offset="6612005">It does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.403" offset="6618796">It means that they have to look.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.105" offset="6629663">When they say on the face of, the face of a judgment is the face of the record, and not one sheet of paper.</text>

            <text syncTime="1877.917" offset="7636945">Well, in Alabama, there is a case that was cited by the dissent which is the case of Harris versus National Bank, a 1981 case long after these Alabama statutes came into being which said once the amount is paid it discharges the garnishee, and in that case they cited the old 1876 case of Pounds versus Hammer, which says that any garnishee paying on a void judgment is liable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1919.328" offset="7802561">Who it's to be repaid from cannot be decided on the set of facts before this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.482" offset="7823146">But apparently they are both liable if you read that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.367" offset="7842685">And that falls into place with the case cite of Betts versus Cole, the 1979 Hawaii case cited by the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.992" offset="7881242">But what has happened here is that the Air Force advocates that this is... you may just unilaterally take somebody's pay, that you don't have to look, and that you don't have to be careful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.382" offset="7930770">They are impatient with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.865" offset="7936726">They are impatient with process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.767" offset="7948325">If indeed they were a stakeholder, they would have no problem with putting the case over into the federal court and let them decide whether the Alabama court itself had been totally arbitrary and capricious and unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.761" offset="8004227">That court, I might say, would not really, in my opinion, be a fair court to go back to under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.450" offset="8042992">It would appear to me also that if they had just once done what they are supposed to do as far as the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act is concerned and appointed a guardian to represent this man, all of this would have been brought to the attention of the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2012.787" offset="8176426">Yes, sir, because the burden is not on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.720" offset="8184158">That particular law places the burden upon the court to do that, and says it shall not enter a default judgment unless this is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.309" offset="8218431">This case is such a unique case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.062" offset="8241523">It is a Murphy's Law case below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.414" offset="8254898">Everything that could possibly happen wrong in a case happened in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.318" offset="8274542">If this case is upheld, then women can judge shop and forum shop all over the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.258" offset="8306307">They can go anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.708" offset="8312054">They can then garnish on the strength of a void judgment, and they can say to the husbands, you know, well, when you are gone, I will take the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.614" offset="8347685">When I am remarried, there is no way you are going to get it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.482" offset="8363149">And this is not a fair procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.570" offset="8383525">It would seem to me that this is the very reason that Congress enacted this amendment to this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.075" offset="8417484">There are, according to the Air Force brief, there are 13,000 military garnishments to be had as a result of this new Act, and yet you will see only four or five cases, and though this was the most dire diversion of what the law had been, there have been... there has been amazingly little litigation on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.893" offset="8524795">Mostly it is not difficult to look at an order and see that there are two attorneys signed on the bottom of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.998" offset="8557187">Second, it is not too hard to ask to send me a copy of the return and a copy of the state law, which is done in the ERISA Act all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.156" offset="8605879">That is not a difficult thing for any person to do that is trained in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.424" offset="8618940">And it would appear to me that somebody has got to look out for soldiers who are gone and not let this kind of thing happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.649" offset="8667841">Yes, it is unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.601" offset="8675678">It is very rare.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.384" offset="8678813">Ex parte judgments are very rare to begin with, and then for this kind of thing to happen is extremely unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.374" offset="8710682">The bad part about this is there is no preexisting debt unless that lower court did in fact have personal jurisdiction over the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.312" offset="8750493">There is no debt for alimony and child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.447" offset="8763031">It is not like a business case where you have a preexisting debt and you may go in and enforce a preexisting debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.037" offset="8789363">The Air Force has not paid off a legal obligation of his, so they are not paying him twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.441" offset="8814963">They haven't paid him in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.741" offset="8824158">All of this is very different from your business case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.130" offset="8849758">When they adopted the law of garnishment, Congress took with it a whole body of law, and these are distinguishable in that you have to remember that none of these cases that are domestic cases have a debt existing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.441" offset="8926976">I do not believe that this Court in looking at the whole decision would say that there has been a fair decision in this case as far as the Alabama court is concerned.</text>
