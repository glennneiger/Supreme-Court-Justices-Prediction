            <text syncTime="67.692" offset="426464">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue before the Court today is whether the Eleventh Circuit's en banc decision setting forth the standards by which prejudice and the competency level of a defendant in a collateral action, the manner in which that standard should be applied is up for consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.343" offset="533044">The state is very concerned because this particular case concerns three major topics of interest to the state of Florida, and that is that we have a standard that has been imposed by the Eleventh Circuit en banc which upends the standards that the Circuit Courts have addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.673" offset="606395">We have a standard that says it is in direct conflict and it acknowledges conflict with a D.C. case, United States versus DeCoster.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.462" offset="649550">It is also in conflict with the Florida Supreme Court's assessment of what the state of Florida will do with regard to assessing competency of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.789" offset="698869">In that particular case, Knight versus State, which is cited in our pleadings, the Florida Supreme Court meticulously set forth the standard for the review of claims of competency of counsel and relied on and looked to with approval the case of DeCoster.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.166" offset="772325">The third part of this case was actually the first and second part, because it has kind of been meshed.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.504" offset="801687">We are concerned here also with the scope that habeas corpus will take in federal litigation by state prisoners, because possibly, possibly the outcome of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has expanded the ability of the defendant to completely forget about cause, demonstrate a degree of prejudice, not affecting the outcome, and open up all claims that may or may not be cognizable pursuant to habeas corpus proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.138" offset="1524234">The second point, as I said, has to do with habeas corpus proceedings and the scope that possibly this particular decision will have on continuing litigation in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.647" offset="1582226">The third part of our complaint with the opinion is the concern, is the concern the state of Florida has with the integrity of the trial judges and the Florida Supreme Court's review of competency of counsel, the question of whether the ultimate fact determined by... the ultimate fact determined by the Florida Supreme Court should be given some deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.930" offset="1683372">Here they used a standard that has not been attacked per se as being unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.667" offset="1710330">The state is contending that in fact where a state court, the Florida Supreme Court in this particular instance, has reviewed a claim of competency of counsel, that standard is constitutional in the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.408" offset="1765292">Federal consideration of competency of counsel in collateral action in federal court should be limited to, first of all, whether the standard is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.615" offset="1810118">If you get past that point, whether in fact the Florida Supreme Court or the trial court in reviewing this initially has made an assessment, a determination as to the correctness of the sentence based on counsel's representations of the defendant at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.613" offset="1890157">Those are the three main concerns we have with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.481" offset="1905622">The facts of the case reflect that Mr. Washington pled guilty to three murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.853" offset="1935088">It occurred during a crime spree, unexplained crime spree that happened in September of 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.942" offset="1971450">The facts are very clear in our record with regard to the murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.846" offset="1991094">In fact, Mr. Washington, without counsel's accountenance, pled guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.536" offset="2025785">First of all he confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.002" offset="2035711">He pled guilty and he waived the sentencing proceeding, which is part of our bifurcated or trifurcated... this is the second part of our trial at the sentencing phase in capital cases where we have a separate sentencing jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.628" offset="2086180">He waived all those things, contrary to counsel's advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.580" offset="2101958">The defendant's case was affirmed by the Florida Supreme Court on claims raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.001" offset="2131633">He then subsequently, many years later, I think in this case four years later, he went to the trial court on a 3.850 motion for collateral relief, seeking relief because he says now my counsel is incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.196" offset="2192446">Although I pled guilty, I have no complaints about his preparation for trial, although I cut him off at the knees with regard to presenting my case to a jury or to a judge, he was ineffective at the sentencing phase because he did not do certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.205" offset="2256498">In particular, there were six, but specifically the court has honed in on the fact that he did not contact or call or investigate certain character witnesses, and that he did not obtain information with regard to Mr. Washington's mental condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.684" offset="2330373">He did not obtain psychiatric reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.052" offset="2343852">Those are the two main claims that his complaint is based on.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.690" offset="2358480">He had more than a dozen issues, but the focus of all the attention in all the courts reviewing this case has been effectiveness of counsel at sentencing with regard to these particular claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.081" offset="2411979">The trial court in this particular case reviewed the claims said under the Knight standard, which requires that you make a specific allegation as to the competency, you make a determination or you show... the defendant has the burden of coming forth and demonstrating that there was some prejudice, and in this particular case that would likely affect the outcome, and that you demonstrate that the actions of counsel fell below that of reasonably effective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.485" offset="2541651">That is the Knight standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.087" offset="2548025">The trial court found that in applying that standard Mr. Washington had not met any of the standards, that it was summarily reversible because the 14 affidavits tendered to the court and the two affidavits of psychiatrists and a psychologist did not refute... first of all, they only went to non-statutory mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.636" offset="2650216">He wasn't complaining about the appropriateness of aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.373" offset="2665158">He wasn't complaining about the appropriateness of statutory mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.010" offset="2687728">It only went to non-statutory mitigating circumstances, and the court stated upon review of this whole record, we find that it does not specifically refute that which counsel did.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.568" offset="2745929">It did not impair Mr. Washington's ability to obtain a sentence of life in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="756.805" offset="3182905">I am saying we are making... it is a weighing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.407" offset="3193354">Has he come forward, has he come forward and demonstrated other evidence that... it's like newly discovered... that, as an example, that the Solicitor General's office has used in their particular pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.048" offset="3239852">I think to bring it more to home, into Florida, it is like quorum novis, leave to file error quorum novis.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.619" offset="3270154">The defendant says, yes, this is all that happened at trial, but I have new evidence, I have other evidence that would affect the outcome, and it was not presented at this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.509" offset="3313726">Under that requirement, he has the burden of demonstrating that it was through no dilatory actions of his own that he didn't uncover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.948" offset="3355522">Certainly that would not be a consideration in this particular issue, but the second part of that, would it have affected the outcome, that is the test, would it have affected the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.285" offset="3388854">So in fact you have a sentencer who has made a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.137" offset="3400244">The question now becomes, has there been anything new introduced into this equation that would require a modification of that?</text>
            <text syncTime="818.410" offset="3429292">In this particular case the trial court and the Florida Supreme Court in reviewing this particular claim held that beyond a moral certainty this factual recital, this new bit of information would not have changed the outcome, that in fact as a matter of law there were aggravating circumstances that were not challenged, there were no mitigating... statutory mitigating circumstances, and that the new material did not create non-statutory mitigating circumstances, and therefore death was appropriate under Florida statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.916" offset="3575369">Under the authorities of Florida cases, where you have one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance, death is an appropriate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.823" offset="3623016">Again, the facts, as I said, there was a guilty plea to all these cases without regard to what counsel was counseling Mr. Washington in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.583" offset="3682053">Mr. Washington did proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.518" offset="3693755">He now comes back and complains about that which has been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.904" offset="3707339">The District Court hearing the case on the petition for writ of habeas corpus concluded that he couldn't... it was a closed question as far as he was concerned, but he ruled that there was a need for an evidentiary hearing, and in fact an evidentiary hearing was conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.217" offset="3784557">During the course of the evidentiary hearing on this matter, Mr. Tunkey, who was Mr. Washington's counsel, was called to testify by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.823" offset="3823009">Others who were called to testify were Judge Fuller and the defendant himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.893" offset="3843280">The main focus, though, I think is important in this particular case is what Mr. Tunkey said, because Mr. Tunkey was now being asked to tell the court, inform the court what was the purpose, why did you do this, why did you do that, did you stop, did you stop your investigation, did you stop your representation of this man once you felt you had this sunken feeling that because he pled guilty he was not taking your advice?</text>
            <text syncTime="949.127" offset="3952159">That was the nature of the inquiry of Mr. Tunkey.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.262" offset="3968773">It was not that the Florida Supreme Court or the trial court had reviewed the facts in light of the affidavits prepared and that in fact it demonstrated that there was no entitlement to relief, but rather Mr. Tunkey, what did you do and why did you do this?</text>
            <text syncTime="970.224" offset="4036587">And that is... Past that point, the trial court after the evidentiary hearing assessed that while, while we, after we have asked him all these questions, and because time has dulled his memory, or because he doesn't want to answer candidly, because he is in fact, he is in fact being pitted against his own client, or maybe because he doesn't know the answer, or maybe because he doesn't remember how he reasoned out why he did something, we have a record that reflects Mr. Tunkey's recollections of what occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.297" offset="4180887">The trial, federal district judge found that while his judgment may not have been correct in all instances, he could not find that prejudice pursuant to DeCoster, and that is that would likely affected the outcome, had occurred, and therefore he denied the petition for writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.246" offset="4264688">The matter was taken by the Eleventh Circuit on direct appeal, and the en banc court, after a panel decision, concluded the standard to be... could, with regard to the prejudice aspect could be things that... could it have been helpful, that was the term, helpful to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.862" offset="4363117">That was the standard of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.528" offset="4369804">The defendant only had to come forward and say, I am showing you that these things could have been helpful to my defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.218" offset="4396554">The en banc panel rejected helpfulness, and in lieu of that substituted that under Fradey there was a likelihood or not likelihood, that substantial and actual prejudice occurred that would have been a disadvantage to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.131" offset="4480250">The state would contend that one of the more... perhaps not... that is a very important issue, but the more important issue in this is also how the court viewed what we must do, and that is what I first started this argument about, how we have turned upside-down the claim here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.580" offset="4573978">The Eleventh Circuit suggested that because the district judge did not make a finding with regard to ineffectiveness of counsel, because he didn't do that, it had to be sent back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.772" offset="4638761">It was not sufficient that he made an assessment that there may have been errors in judgment, but that there was no prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.778" offset="4670840">The state would contend that is the very means by which you go about judging collateral issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.932" offset="4699365">You make an assessment based on the allegations raised and the evidence presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.353" offset="4721099">In this particular case, in the federal court, the state, the state produced all of the defendant's affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.541" offset="4757880">When he came forth in his petition for writ of habeas corpus, he filed a bare bones petition, and it was the state in their response that included the record, which was their responsibility, but also included the affidavits which the defendant had relied on in the state trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.153" offset="4820260">This is kind of the reverse of the weak case, strong case theory of going weak case in state court, strong case in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.141" offset="4848263">We had a strong case in the state court and we had a weak case or a minimal case in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.545" offset="4869893">But the point is that getting back to what the court found, the court said, okay, there may have been problems, he may not have used the best judgment, but there was no prejudice demonstrated, and that is the focal point of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.137" offset="4936244">We are talking about fundamental fairness, whether there has been miscarriage of justice here, not whether Mr. Tunkey should be crucified, and then after he has been crucified, we say, well, yes, you know, he was a nice guy, but you know, actually, looking at the record and seeing what he did, it really wasn't so bad, was it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.599" offset="5006043">As a matter of fact, it probably didn't reduce itself to prejudice to this particular defendant, whether you base it on the standard that the Eleventh Circuit has imposed or you base it on the standard that the state suggests is the proper standard for prejudice, and that is that it has a likely effect on the outcome of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.595" offset="5086082">To give full credit to the Eleventh Circuit, I might add that although in suggesting that first we crucify Mr. Tunkey and then we consider whether prejudice has obtained, they did set out in Footnote 33 of the majority opinion that there may be instances when this kind of procedure could be changed, that in fact you might look to the prejudice aspect first rather than reviewing whether counsel had rendered effective assistance of counsel or counsel's representation fell below a certain standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.230" offset="5296629">However, in this particular case they said, no, no, we find that in this case you have to make an assessment with regard to what Mr. Tunkey did and then, and then, although the court has already found that we do not disagree with that because possibly there could have been an opportunity or there was a reason for this, there may have been, very well been tactical reasons for the way he proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.280" offset="5396835">In spite of all that, in spite of the fact there was no prejudice, then you come back, and we will see what you've done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.785" offset="5422853">But first of all go back and talk about Mr. Tunkey and whether he in fact represented Mr. Washington well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.522" offset="5453782">As Justice O'Connor asked the Solicitor General in the first case, this is a B case, not an A case, based on your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.597" offset="5494115">Certainly the two elements that we need to review is whether in fact prejudice has occurred and to what degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.501" offset="5525671">The circuits throughout this state or this country have utilized the McMahon rule or the McMahon statement, and in 13 years have developed all sorts of degrees of prejudice, degrees or standards to be applied, and that is what is so important today, is that we have some feeling for what kind of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.253" offset="5640714">While the respondents have conceded in their pleadings that in fact the defendant does have a burden to show prejudice, they would take issue certainly with the degree of prejudice the state would contend is necessary in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.499" offset="5717723">They are opting, I might add, for the panel decision, not the en banc decision in this particular case, although there have been no cross pleadings filed that I know of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.640" offset="5770281">The state would contend that the only way, the only way that we can resolve the kinds of problems that exist in habeas corpus, in collateral litigation from state prisoners, and in fact, in fact, federal prisoners under 2255, is to determine that the prejudice that is to... the burden of prejudice the defendant must reach goes to a likelihood of affecting the outcome.</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.823" offset="6083019">We are looking at the... we have an otherwise valid judgment and sentence that is now later being attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.913" offset="6107365">Now, while it is true that in the direct appeal he is attacking an otherwise valid judgment and sentence, it hasn't been given the imprimatur of an appellate court to say yes, that particular judgment and sentence has been approved, but the standard in a sense should not be that far off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.207" offset="6180508">It may be the Agres standard, where there is something just quite... a little less than showing the likelihood that it would affect the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.646" offset="6218229">Perhaps it could be that there was a reasonable doubt raised that wasn't there otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.217" offset="6240590">But again, that is not an issue that we have come forward with, because it is not the normal kind of issue that we have... we are faced on a given day to day basis, and we are very concerned again with the collateral type prejudice that should be pronounced with regard to the standard to be pronounced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.278" offset="6316763">The second part of this, of course, is also, and it is important in this case, although it is not as precious to the state, and that is the standard with regard to how we determine competency of counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2811.640" offset="11402281">So there would be no need to shift the standards back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.675" offset="11414402">For example, under our test, first of all, or the test proposed in our brief, first of all, the petitioner, the defendant, would have to show a serious error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.150" offset="11456302">Secondly, even if he shows a basic failing of counsel, what is essentially removal of a basic attribute of assistance from his trial, he would have to show that that impaired the presentation of the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.558" offset="11513876">Now, by showing the impairment in the presentation of the defense, we are first of all focusing on outcome in this standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.330" offset="11545014">It is the first glimpse of outcome, and the test really says that the integrity of the adversary process must be preserved and can only be preserved by competent counsel, but if in that case there was no effect or adverse effect on the defense, the adversary system functioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2875.749" offset="11658699">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there are three basic principles in this Court's Sixth Amendment decisions that must be considered in deciding whether to adopt a standard of prejudice that assesses... that focuses on the effect on outcome or one that focuses on the effect on the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.549" offset="11665909">First, the standard must preserve the fundamental nature of counsel in our system of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.118" offset="11668103">Second, the standard should provide guidelines for the lower courts to apply the Sixth Amendment in a variety of situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.122" offset="11696211">And third, as United States versus Morrison points out, in the Sixth Amendment area, the standard should accommodate society's interest in the administration of criminal justice and finality of judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.829" offset="11743022">I have already explained why the outcome determinative test is an utter failure in preserving any sense of the fundamental nature of the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.387" offset="11789207">In contrast, a standard that looks at the effect on the defense breathes much needed substance into the formal right of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.326" offset="11824942">This is not a question of undermining the adversary system by questioning counsel's adequacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.182" offset="11860364">It is a matter of preserving an adversary system that assumes competent counsel, and that assumes and indeed requires competent counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.971" offset="11907594">Secondly, the outcome determinative concentration on result will not provide any guidelines for the lower courts in Sixth Amendment analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.428" offset="11945419">It is uniquely unsuited to develop a body of precedent that is so necessary to develop standards as to the adequacy of counsel's performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.134" offset="11988260">In fact, the outcome determinative test brings the Court full circle into the subjective morass of the farce and mockery standard, and it would be ironic and it is ironic for petitioners to argue three weeks after the last circuit, the Second Circuit, in Trapnel versus United States, rejected in an en banc form, although it was a panel decision, the farce and mockery standard, for the petitioners to argue that this Court should resurrect what is nothing less than an artifact of that outmoded standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3828.508" offset="15469755">I just have... oh, thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.443" offset="15473413">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.093" offset="15476025">The state would contend that the assessment here that there was a failure to investigate or produce witnesses, that is a limited review of what investigation is supposed to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.821" offset="15543003">If you look at this record, you will find that Mr. Tunkey did on numerous occasions talk with Mr. Washington with regard to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.558" offset="15577902">He did discuss, as a matter of fact, at the close of the state's case, at the proceeding, the sentencing proceeding, Mr. Tunkey and Mr. Washington spoke with regard to what evidence should be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.853" offset="15639133">At that point the court asked, well, are you going to present any evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.155" offset="15656270">He said, no, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.105" offset="15660136">And then he proceeded to go through why certain aggravating circumstances were appropriate, why certain mitigating circumstances may or may not be appropriate, through what he had produced in his sentencing brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.850" offset="15723039">And I might add, we need to look not just at what the allegation is, but what the man did, what Mr. Tunkey did in behalf of Mr. Washington with regard to sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.806" offset="15762954">The record reflects that he produced a sentencing brief which detailed those aggravating and mitigating circumstances and non-statutory mitigating circumstances which Mr. Tunkey felt were appropriate in his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.399" offset="15825230">As a matter of fact, he went so far to suggest that remorse, the fact that Mr. Washington pled guilty, that he cooperated, those were all non-statutory mitigating factors that the court should consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.975" offset="15875594">He also argued vehemently with regard to what aggravating circumstances should not be applicable, and indeed he, prior to the sentencing proceeding, was able to get a rap sheet of Mr. Washington's excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.318" offset="15940900">He was also instrumental in getting the trial court to not consider one aggravating circumstance which would have been appropriately applied in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.959" offset="15983532">He convinced them of that.</text>
