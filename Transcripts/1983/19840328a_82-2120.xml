            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="140491">We will hear arguments first this morning in Smith against Robinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.648" offset="175077">Mr. Larson, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. E. Richard Larson</label>
            <text syncTime="13.000" offset="192422">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.073" offset="212693">This case involves Petitioners' entitlement to attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. Section 1988 in this action to enforce constitutional rights through Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.541" offset="270581">This case also involves fee entitlement under Section 505(b) of the Rehabilitation Act in this action brought to enforce and to charge a violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.311" offset="329722">As in Vlum v. Stenson, decided unanimously by this Court last week, resolution in this case begins and ends with the legislative history accompanying these fee provision, a legislative history in which Congress stated that plaintiffs need not prevail on a substantial constitutional claim or on another overlapping fee claim in order to be entitled to fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.511" offset="450512">This case we submit is further controlled by this Court's unanimous decision in Maher v. Gagne, a decision in which this Court not only conclusively applied the foregoing legislative history, but indeed it is the same legislative history that is applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.934" offset="524178">And in that case this Court held that a plaintiff who never obtained a ruling on her substantial constitutional claim nonetheless was entitled to fees under Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.991" offset="572452">In this case, Petitioner Tommy Smith is a physically and emotionally handicapped child who walks with the aid of leg braces and crutches due to cerebral palsy.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.719" offset="619263">Tommy was eight years old when this litigation was commenced in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.413" offset="642042">Tommy at that time was enrolled in a special education day program approved by the Respondents and paid for by the school committee as part of their education program.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.762" offset="691466">This litigation was commenced when the local school committee, with the subsequent approval and support of the Respondents, proposed to exclude Tommy from receiving an education solely because of the nature of his handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.142" offset="753010">Respondents' consistent litigation position throughout this litigation has been that the school committees, including the local school committee here, and the Respondents had no responsibility for educating Tommy or similarly situated persons who had an emotional handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.953" offset="828243">Petitioners' complaint alleged three substantial federal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.847" offset="851858">Initially, they were constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.338" offset="861784">Indeed, the opening complaint alleged only constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.041" offset="876622">This was a due process claim... the Petitioner was being excluded, being denied an education, with no hearing whatsoever... and also a straight equal, protection claim... that Petitioner was being denied an education, excluded from an education, in violation of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.493" offset="950391">Petitioners also alleged a federal claim under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the language of which specifically precludes the exclusion of a person from receiving federal benefits in a federal program, a program supported by federal moneys, solely on the basis of handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.387" offset="1037954">A third federal claim was also alleged in this case, the '75 Handicapped Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.641" offset="1063031">After the Act became effective and subsequent to plaintiff's success on their constitutional claims, plaintiffs added the claim that the Respondents had violated the Education for all Handicapped Children Act of 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.491" offset="1122382">Now, there is no question in this case about the appropriateness of the education that was designed for Tommy.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.688" offset="1155191">It's simply a question of exclusion versus non-exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.191" offset="1169193">There also is no question in this case Petitioners in fact prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.073" offset="1188733">They prevailed initially and throughout the litigation on their due process claim, and they ultimately prevailed, primarily as a result of a certified decision by the Rhode Island Supreme Court.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="274.672" offset="1239097">Mr. Larson, you say that your clients prevailed throughout the litigation on their due process claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.848" offset="1279848">I didn't read Judge Campbell's opinion is necessarily agreeing with that.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Richard Larson</label>
            <text syncTime="289.830" offset="1299805">The characterization of Judge Campbell's opinion... or in the opinion, is that we ultimately prevailed as a matter of the Education for all Handicapped Children Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.910" offset="1352050">Judge Campbell does not disagree whatsoever that throughout the course of this litigation it was the preliminary injunction entered on the due process claim pursuant to which plaintiffs through the course of the litigation prevailed.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="316.468" offset="1406280">What is the difference between prevailing through the course of the litigation and ultimately prevailing?</text>
            <text syncTime="323.012" offset="1432507">I take it from your argument you see those as two different things.</text>

            <text syncTime="325.924" offset="1444106">No, I was saying that there is no question on this record whatsoever, Justice Rehnquist, about the fact that the plaintiffs prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.278" offset="1469601">Under Hensley--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="334.149" offset="1477020">Well, but the Court of Appeals seems to have held otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.192" offset="1493216">I don't believe that there is any question that the Court of Appeals viewed the plaintiff as having prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.998" offset="1520383">Indeed, in the first decision to the First Circuit--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="348.200" offset="1533235">Well, I think the Court of Appeals agreed that the plaintiff prevailed without a doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.663" offset="1555074">But I read the Court of Appeals opinion as intimating that you prevailed on the EAHCA.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="362.288" offset="1589555">But then you're arguing about a question of fact, really, where the Court of Appeals is against you, and we ordinarily don't review questions of fact.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="e_richard_larson" startTime="369.154" stopTime="396.042">
            <label>Mr. E. Richard Larson</label>
            <text syncTime="369.154" offset="1617036">Justice Rehnquist, it doesn't matter with regard to the statutory threshold that plaintiffs must meet through Hensley v. Eckerhart how plaintiffs happened to prevail here.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.820" offset="1659668">The matter of fact as found by the district court is that plaintiffs did prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.214" offset="1681298">Indeed, our opponents at the fee hearing admitted that we had obtained the objective sought in the lawsuit and that we accordingly were the prevailing party--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="396.042" stopTime="413.412">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="396.042" offset="1724556">Well, but I don't suppose anyone disputes that, but I think what the First Circuit says is you prevailed on the EAHCA count; that's an all-embracing statutory claim that really covers everything you could have gotten on your constitutional counts, and since that doesn't provide for attorney's fees you can't get them.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="e_richard_larson" startTime="413.412" stopTime="450.486">

            <text syncTime="413.412" offset="1794042">--The First Circuit's decision on the fee issue is different from the First Circuit's decision on defendant's appeal on their motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.780" offset="1839600">On the first decision, the First Circuit states that plaintiffs have obtained the objective of their lawsuit as a matter of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.905" offset="1880037">That's on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.467" offset="1886307">Subsequently in the collateral fee proceeding, the First Circuit basically stated that the plaintiffs have prevailed both as a matter of state law and as a matter of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, ultimately prevailed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1299.769" offset="5339485">For example, in Brown v. GSA the Court looked at the legislative history and what had Congress done in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.225" offset="5369369">It had said there is no remedy for employment discrimination in the federal sector because of sovereign immunity, and it cited Blaze v. Moon in the Fifth Circuit, it cited a number of other sovereign immunity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.334" offset="5417748">Congress was aware from its perception that it was operating on a blank sheet, and it thereby enacted comprehensive legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.650" offset="5455051">The legislative history here is totally different in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.401" offset="5469993">First of all, with regard to fees, the fee statutes at issue here were enacted, Section 1988 was enacted, in 1976, a year after the '75 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.880" offset="5519939">Section 505 was enacted three years later, in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.984" offset="5544390">I mean, there is no doctrine of repeal by implication or preemption which allows a Congress sitting in 1975 to preempt acts that the Congress takes in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.559" offset="5586708">With regard to the substantive rights, it is even less likely that Congress could have preempted, for a variety of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.847" offset="5619831">First of all, this is a spending statute which is optional with the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.149" offset="5637072">It's almost as if, to follow through on this preemption or repeal by implication argument, if it's worth anything, that Congress delegated to the states whether or not the states wanted to repeal the applicability of 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.951" offset="5712200">So if the state opts out of this, they're covered by 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.074" offset="5732785">We know that New Mexico is not covered by the 1975 Handicapped Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.198" offset="5749190">Yet 504 and 1983 fully apply there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.050" offset="5768625">I mean, it would be absolutely unheard of for Congress to delegate to the states the repeal of federal statutes, much less the enforcement of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.475" offset="5802375">And finally, of course, what is ultimately controlling is the legislative history itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.778" offset="5823587">The legislative history... the Senate report alone has 22 paragraphs spanning 16 pages discussing the existence of preexisting and concurrent remedies in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.288" offset="5881578">There is absolutely full awareness of these preexisting remedies, and the case couldn't be farther away from Brown v. GSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.955" offset="5916269">This is rally a Jones v. Mayer type of case or a Johnson v. REA type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.349" offset="5937794">Congress was aware and did not at all preempt or repeal by implication those remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.722" offset="5959319">There has to be a clear statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.542" offset="5966633">It is not here whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.334" offset="5977813">We believe, on the basis of Maher v. Gagne, that this case should be conclusively resolved in Petitioners' favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.915" offset="6048135">In Maher there was a substantial constitutional claim which was not addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.050" offset="6076661">There was also a substantial federal statutory claim which did not necessarily have a fee authorization attached to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.958" offset="6124308">The plaintiffs were determined to have passed that statutory threshold of having prevailed without ever receiving an adjudication on their constitutional claim, and this Court unanimously held that plaintiff, because of the fact that she had raised a substantial constitutional claim, was entitled to fees under Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.644" offset="6211035">And the same result flows here, not only under Section 1988 but also under Section 505.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.508" offset="6242486">In conclusion, we believe that there is little question on this record and as a matter of law that the First Circuit erred here and the plaintiffs are entitled to fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.177" offset="6293164">Now, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, this doesn't have anything to do with the amount of fees, which is still an issue or will be an issue on remand in the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.502" offset="6326496">I would like to reserve the remainder of my time, unless there are any questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1622.471" offset="6630352">Then the school committee looked at the situation and reevaluated it and made a determination that there was another... there was a state agency, the Rhode Island Department of Mental Health, that it felt under certain statutes was responsible for this child's... or should be responsible for educating or placing this child at Bradley Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.712" offset="6699315">So the school committee told the parents that the school committee was not going to fund that placement, not going to provide any more funds for that placement, which of course would result in that placement being ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.050" offset="6748635">At that point what happened in the case was the plaintiffs in this action filed a complaint in the federal district court, and I don't believe that this first complaint speaks of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.759" offset="6799521">If I remember it correctly, I think it solely speaks to procedural due process, and more particularly, the basic argument of this complaint was simply that Rhode Island regulations, Rhode Island special ed regulations, which even though the Handicapped Act was not yet in effect apparently we had some pre-knowledge of what these regulations would look like, so it looks as if the regulations we were using at the time really matched the ultimate federal handicapped regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.586" offset="6910803">Under those regulations, a placement couldn't be changed unless the parents consented to it or unless they were granted a hearing and as a result of that hearing a change was ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.605" offset="6954898">Well, what happened in this case was the plaintiffs felt that they weren't going to be granted that hearing, even though they had asked for it, so they filed the complaint in federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.893" offset="6995962">The federal district court judge looked at the complaint and he said, yes, under Rhode Island regulations you have a right to a hearing before the placement can be terminated, and this funding, potential funding dispute between the state agencies was exactly that sort of funding dispute or that sort of change in placement dispute that should be adjudicated through the available state administrative procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.730" offset="7095332">So the federal judge issued a preliminary injunction to keep the child at Bradley Hospital at the expense of the school committee and then required the school committee to conduct a due process hearing as required by Rhode Island administrative special education regulations, and also that opportunity should be given the parties to appeal to the Commissioner of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.273" offset="7181536">So that's what happened in this case, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.054" offset="7192612">There was a hearing before the local school committee, an administrative sort of hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.948" offset="7208181">The school committee took evidence and looked at the matter, and they resolved in a written decision that they were not responsible because a state agency was responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.485" offset="7246424">That decision was then appealed to the Commissioner of Education, who held a de novo hearing, acting as a hearing officer, and listened to both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.022" offset="7288533">Now, the Rhode Island Supreme Court in a case... and by then, by the time the matter reaches the Commissioner of Education, the Handicapped Children's Act is in force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.796" offset="7323642">And you'll note if you look at the record, one of the complaints the plaintiffs had against the Commissioner, and an issue on which they lost, they were arguing that he couldn't act as a hearing officer under the Education for all Handicapped Children's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.975" offset="7376305">So there is no doubt here, the plaintiffs have even agreed, that this was a hearing pursuant to the Education for all Handicapped Children's Act at that stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.320" offset="7409742">What happened was, the Commissioner heard the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.413" offset="7422071">And the Rhode Island Supreme Court had indicated at the time that this was a difficult question and it had not yet resolved the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.477" offset="7454359">So that left the Commissioner in the position of having to make his own decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.560" offset="7470659">So what the Commissioner did was, he found that the Rhode Island Department of Mental Health should have been educating this child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.295" offset="7501588">That was his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.528" offset="7510574">Now, what happened after that was the plaintiffs appealed the matter to federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.792" offset="7539622">They took the matter up there, arguing that, no, it was not the Department of Mental Health, but rather the school committee, that should be responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.478" offset="7574313">Now, with that Rhode Island Supreme Court prior precedent that I mentioned, indicating that this was a difficult issue, I was involved in the case at that point and I suggested to the court that the matter, the question, be certified to the Rhode Island Supreme Court for a determination as to who was responsible and who wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.210" offset="7653307">And so then the Rhode Island Supreme Court came down with a decision indicating that, that in fact the local school committee was responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.667" offset="7695103">So in this case I would suggest that what you really have, it's not a normal special ed case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.942" offset="7720181">What you have is a state level hearing officer who heard a case and he decided the case in a way that ultimately was not... that was held to be wrong by the Rhode Island Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.166" offset="7761141">Now, because he--</text>

            <text syncTime="1910.870" offset="7783920">And the strange thing about... I shouldn't say... the interesting thing about this case, if you read one of the later opinions of the district court in this matter, he said... what finally happened in this case was, once the Rhode Island Supreme Court rendered its decision, which from my perspective ended it... I don't think you can presume that state agencies are not going to follow their own supreme court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.078" offset="7876707">Plaintiffs, though, perhaps wishing to have some sort of order on the record, looking forward to some sort of attorney's fees, requested a declaratory judgment declaring that the Commissioner's decision was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.146" offset="7933027">I still don't know the point of doing that, other than trying to form a basis for fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.871" offset="7963955">Now, the court ultimately entered that sort of decision and declared, for whatever purpose, that the Commissioner's decision was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.917" offset="8000109">But that was a decision by the Commissioner of Education really taken entirely, I would say, in essence in his judicial capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.711" offset="8031247">And you'll note in one of the district court's opinions, the district court makes the point that it is not ruling against the Commissioner... and it uses these words...</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.100" offset="8076804">"on any basis that the Commissioner ever failed to enforce state law or failed to see that state law was carried out. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.743" offset="8099374">No, the court rejected that, said that that was not the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.965" offset="8116302">It said the reason why it was acting in the case was because the Commissioner had rendered this decision, and it gave the date for the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.000" offset="8144409">So I would say there's no doubt that all we have in this case is a pure Education for all Handicapped Children's matter, where a hearing officer acting under that Act has rendered a certain decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2400.952" offset="9744253">Well, what they were saying is that the only reason why these constitutional claims were added from the Commissioner's perspective was sort of transparently, I would suggest, for the purpose of getting attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.477" offset="9822307">The interesting sort of issue in the case is this: You could raise this sort of constitutional issue, whatever it may have been... I don't think in my mind it was ever, assuming that it existed, it was ever that well articulated... and there was no real way that anyone could ever get at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.519" offset="9894509">I think that in the old Siler case this Court established a rule about avoiding deciding constitutional questions, and the purpose of that rule was because the Court for prudential reasons wanted to turn away from deciding those issues, recognizing the problems you get with constitutional constructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.362" offset="9977892">When you've got a state... when you've got a federal statute like the Handicapped Children's Act, it's so wide-ranging, realistically no one is turning away from deciding the difficult constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.829" offset="10031704">That's not really involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.663" offset="10047064">Everyone's attention is simply focused on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.816" offset="10063678">So that rules seems to be potentiating here into something that it was never intended to involve, the fee award question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.512" offset="10110489">What I'm suggesting is that when the alleged 1983 constitutional claim is coextensive with the Education for All Handicapped Children's Act, we can't believe the 1988 fee provision is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.374" offset="10181960">I also want to point out briefly, Your Honor, that we've raised the contention that the Commissioner here is not liable for fees because he was acting in a judicial capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.068" offset="10268687">I won't belabor that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.850" offset="10279867">I just want to point out that we would contend that if administrative hearing officers are going to be put in a position where they or their agencies are going to have to pay fees depending upon how they decide the case, that's really not going to contribute to fair and equal due process for anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.922" offset="10352174">Finally, Your Honors, I'd like to suggest that this Court's recent decision in the Pennhurst case may have some applicability to this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.751" offset="10395433">To the extent that this question was ultimately decided on state law grounds, that decision suggests that perhaps the federal district court shouldn't have gotten involved in the matter in the first place, at least in relation to the Commissioner's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.263" offset="10473487">Now, we have to concede that we're here on a motion for attorney's fees, but I would suggest that if there's some Eleventh Amendment immunity applicable in this case that it should be applicable even now on the question of attorney's fees, because the effectiveness of that ruling is best served by avoiding... by nullifying federal judicial actions, which in essence, on the basis of a state court, state supreme court decision, it just goes out of its way to reverse, for no very good reason perhaps, a decision of an administrative hearing officer.</text>
