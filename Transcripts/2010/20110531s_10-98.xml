            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.341" offset="130759">The respondent Abdullah al-Kidd alleges that, after the September 11th terrorist attacks, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft, the petitioner here, authorized federal officials to detain terrorism suspects using the federal material-witness statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.137" offset="218008">According to al-Kidd, this pretextual detention policy, holding someone that you suspect of a crime under a statute that enables you to detain material witnesses, led to his material-witness arrest in March of 2003 as he was boarding a plane to Saudi Arabia.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.169" offset="302122">Two days earlier, federal officials had informed a Magistrate Judge that if al-Kidd boarded his flight they believed information "crucial" to the prosecution of Sami Omar al-Hussayen, would be lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.129" offset="361890">Prosecutors never called al-Kidd as a witness, and he alleges they never meant -- never meant to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.696" offset="392192">After his release, al-Kidd filed this suit to challenge the constitutionality of Ashcroft's alleged policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.075" offset="425733">Ashcroft filed a motion to dismiss -- oh -- and -- and by the way, if you're detained as a material witness just as if you're detained as a suspect, you're entitled to -- to be released from bond and -- and that indeed did occur after a number of days.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.265" offset="502429">But after his release, al-Kidd filed this suit to challenge the constitutionality of his being held at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.262" offset="530432">Ashcroft filed a motion to dismiss based on absolute immunity and qualified immunity which the District Court denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.637" offset="560003">The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Fourth Amendment prohibits pretextual arrests absent probable cause of criminal wrongdoing, and that Ashcroft could not claim qualified or absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.602" offset="623846">We granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.188" offset="634190">Qualified immunity shields a government official from money damages unless two things are present.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.776" offset="664492">(1) he violated a statutory or constitutional right, and (2) that right was "clearly established" at the time of the challenged conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.376" offset="702945">We hold in the opinion filed with the clerk this morning that Ashcroft did not violate al-Kidd's Fourth Amendment rights, and that even if he had, the wrongfulness of his conduct would not have been clearly established in 2003.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.766" offset="760519">Whether a detention is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment "is predominantly an objective inquiry."</text>
            <text syncTime="169.219" offset="782252">We ask whether the -- these are quotes from our cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.617" offset="795836">We ask whether "the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify the challenged action."</text>
            <text syncTime="180.136" offset="825929">This approach recognizes that efficient and evenhanded application of the law demands that we look to whether the arrest is objectively justified, rather than to the motive of the arresting officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.372" offset="882876">Two "limited exceptions" to this rule are our special-needs and administrative-search cases, where "actual motivations" do matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.877" offset="920910">Apart from those categories in which the present case is plainly not included, we have almost uniformly rejected invitations to probe subjective intent of the arresting officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.602" offset="971797">The Court of Appeals nevertheless read one of our vehicle checkpoint cases, case called Edmond, to give purpose a more extensive role in Fourth Amendment analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.652" offset="1020071">In its view, Edmond established that "programmatic purpose is relevant to Fourth Amendment analysis of programs of seizures without probable cause."</text>
            <text syncTime="241.353" offset="1070853">That was mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.217" offset="1078272">It was not the absence of probable cause that triggered Edmond's invalidating-purpose inquiry, but rather, the checkpoint's failure to be based on individualized suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.187" offset="1126128">Such warrantless, suspicionless intrusions are far removed from the fact here, where a neutral Magistrate Judge issued a warrant authorizing al-Kidd's arrest, and the affidavit accompanying the warrant application gave individualized reasons to believe that he was a material witness who would soon disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.606" offset="1207839">A warrant based on individualized suspicion, in fact grants more protection against the malevolent and the incompetent than existed in most of our cases that eschew inquiries into intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.042" offset="1265622">Even assuming -- contrarfactually -- that Ashcroft's alleged detention policy violated the Fourth Amendment, he deserves qualified immunity anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.994" offset="1305433">A Government official's conduct violates clearly established law when, at the time of the challenged conduct, "the contours of a right are sufficiently clear" that every "reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right."</text>
            <text syncTime="316.209" offset="1370216">That's a quote from our cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.464" offset="1379307">The constitutional question in this case falls far short of that threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.139" offset="1401981">At the time of al-Kidd's arrest, not a single judicial opinion had held that pretext could render an objectively reasonable arrest pursuant to a material-witness warrant unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.683" offset="1448166">The Court of Appeals made up for that shortcoming by citing a District Court's footnoted dictum suggesting that the use of material -- material-witness warrants to detain suspect "is an illegitimate use of the statute" and mentioning Ashcroft by name.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.121" offset="1521936">We find that reasoning extraordinary.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.661" offset="1532071">The footnoted dictum falls far short of what is necessary to clearly establish the law even when that dictum mentions the defendant by name.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.910" offset="1573031">The Court of Appeals also found clearly established law lurking in the broad "history and purposes of the Fourth Amendment," and in several prior opinions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.195" offset="1618171">As to the former, we have repeatedly told courts -- and the Ninth Circuit in particular -- not to define clearly established law of such a high level of generality.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.238" offset="1662370">And as to the latter, the Court of Appeals seems to have cherry-picked the aspects of our opinions that gave colorable support to the proposition that the unconstitutionality of the action here was clearly established while ignoring numerous statements that foreshadow today's Fourth Amendment holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.197" offset="1746171">We have held the qualified immunity protects "all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law."</text>
            <text syncTime="418.606" offset="1779816">Ashcroft deserves neither label because Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law, we need not address the more difficult question of whether he enjoys absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.693" offset="1828195">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.071" offset="1845750">Justice Kennedy has filed a concurring Opinion in which Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor joined in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.831" offset="1872708">Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justices Breyer, and Sotomayor joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.894" offset="1901025">Justice Sotomayor has also filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justices Ginsburg, and Breyer joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.073" offset="1929759">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
