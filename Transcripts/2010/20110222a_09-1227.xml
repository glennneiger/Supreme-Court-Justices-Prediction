            <text syncTime="12.141" offset="153955">The standing of Petitioner to challenge the constitutionality of the Federal statute under which her liberty is being deprived should not be open to serious question.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.180" offset="194184">She clearly satisfies this Court's modern tripartite test for standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.448" offset="211216">Indeed, it is hard to imagine an injury more particularized or concrete than six years in Federal prison, and the liberty interest she seeks to vindicate is her own, not some third party's.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.541" offset="259594">In many ways, I think "standing" is a bit of a misnomer here.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.910" offset="273074">Petitioner is not a plaintiff who seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of a Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.029" offset="289583">She is a defendant who has been hailed into court by a Federal prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.814" offset="304630">There is no logical reason she should not be able to mount a constitutional attack on the statute that is the basis for the prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="64.740" offset="364398">Well, I think it was in the habeas context, but the Spencer decision does talk about how, when you have a criminal defendant or somebody who is serving a sentence, their standing to challenge the conviction is essentially one of the easiest standing cases you can imagine.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.833" offset="420718">And I think in a sense, the same principles would apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.285" offset="434510">But as I said, I think standing is normally something you think about as applying to the plaintiff, who is invoking the jurisdiction of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.272" offset="462514">So what's really at issue here is something -- almost more of a bar on somebody's ability to make an argument that would vindicate their liberty, and I see no reason why, in logic, that should be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.080" offset="509743">Now, the court of appeals essentially didn't apply ordinary--</text>

            <text syncTime="168.205" offset="778282">I mean, I think if -- if the Federal executive tried to imprison you based on your religion, you could take issue with that and say that's an Establishment Clause violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="192.051" offset="873576">But in all events, bringing it back to the case before you, I think there is no reason to think that ordinary principles of standing wouldn't give my client every ability to challenge the constitutionality of the statute under which she's being held.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.112" offset="1077854">My problem, though, is I'm not sure I understand some clearly defined set of Tenth Amendment claims that are uniquely only Tenth Amendment claims and not enumerated power claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="272.279" offset="1194569">The Printz case itself went out of its way to say that it was an enumerated power case.</text>

            <text syncTime="284.803" offset="1244620">Well, let's assume, Mr. Clement, that there is such a thing as a claim in which you're saying, I can see that this is within Congress's Article I powers, but there is an independent Tenth Amendment limitation on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.461" offset="1291222">Do you have any claims like that?</text>

            <text syncTime="354.897" offset="1524966">But one of the arguments we've preserved, for example, is the argument that Missouri vs. Holland is not a blank check for the government, that it requires a balancing of the State's interests against the Federal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.519" offset="1567493">And if on remand, I wax eloquent about the State's interest in criminal prosecution and law enforcement, I would hate for a trap door to open up at that point and I be told that, wait, wait, that's too much of the State's interest and not enough of your own interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="398.724" offset="1700300">Exactly right, Justice Kennedy, and that's the fundamental worry I have here, is that this Court's cases have not drawn a distinction between commandeering claims and enumerated powers claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.281" offset="1742514">The two cases the government points to, New York and Printz, both go out of their way to say that they are mirror images or, in fact, enumerated power claims, because a law that commandeers is not necessary and proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.855" offset="1796848">And I do also think that a part of the problem with the suggestion that somehow Tennessee Electric should be reimagined as a third party standing claim is it fundamentally miscomprehends for whom the structural provisions of the Constitution are there for.</text>

            <text syncTime="596.296" offset="2490556">And I think this case compares pretty favorably with Missouri against Holland because there the state's interests was very weak because these birds were just flying through on their way and there was no real State interest, or so this Court held, whereas in this case the State has a real legitimate interest in law enforcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="715.950" offset="2969224">It's only one sentence, but it's there in the opinion, and I think what it's saying, Justice Roberts says, well, he already finished, he just finished saying nobody -- Congress hasn't violated some rule against creating a system of regulation in this statute because it isn't regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.296" offset="3054592">But then he said, but even if it were, even if it were, and if your complaint was that Congress has acted outside its authority, which they might have thought at that time, in creating a system, TVA, that competes with local systems, even if that were so, the appellants, absent the State or their officers, would have no standing in this suit to raise the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="785.742" offset="3248421">First of all, the first thing I would say about that sentence is that I don't think, read in the context of the entire opinion, it actually means that the Court is trying to impose a special disability on Tenth Amendment claims, because remember, they have already rejected the plaintiff's basis for having standing.</text>

            <text syncTime="812.306" offset="3354687">But what I think it stands for is the proposition -- it rejects the argument that if you don't otherwise have standing under the governing standing rule of the day that you somehow have a license to bring a Tenth Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.364" offset="3398886">And if that's what it stands, well, it was right then and it continues to be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.149" offset="3414037">A second point to make about it is it is dictum, and if you read the sentence, what it says is the following: It makes a reference to what it's already established a couple of paragraphs earlier, which is the states at issue here have passed laws to accommodate TVA's sale of power, and then it goes on to say, if this were not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.248" offset="3498360">What does that -- that is a counterfactual hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.216" offset="3514243">It's the worst kind of dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.650" offset="3519990">It says if this were not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.233" offset="3526363">If it were not the fact that the States had already taken these actions to affirmatively accommodate then we would have a different question and then there wouldn't be standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.070" offset="3553740">So it is dictum I think and can be disregarded as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.356" offset="3566801">But really if you ask me what you should do with it, you should do what you did in Twombly, with some language in an opinion that had continued to cause trouble in the 50 years since.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.396" offset="3611000">You should just say that's no longer good law because it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.681" offset="3624166">The central holding of Tennessee Electric was overruled 40 years ago in the Camp case, and I think this language is of a piece from that legal interest test, the legal wrong test of standing, and I think this Court should make clear that it doesn't apply any longer, and the virtue of that would be that it would free up the lower courts to decide these Tenth Amendment standing claims based on an application of normal standing principles, because that's not happening in the lower court right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.098" offset="3737851">In the lower court right now what happens is somebody comes in with a Tenth Amendment claim of whatever stripe, maybe it's a commandeering claim, maybe it's not, and what they're confronted with, especially if it's a commandeering claim, is a quick citation of Tennessee Electric, an equally quick citation of Shearson which says only this Court can overturn its decisions, and that's it.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.745" offset="3812352">No standing analysis, nothing subtle about the particular claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="945.520" offset="3887480">As Petitioner confirmed this morning, the central claim that he is making about the unconstitutionality of section 229 is that it exceeds Congress's enumerated powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="973.854" offset="4000852">Now, the Third Circuit in reaching the contrary conclusion relied on this Court's decision in Tennessee Electric v. TVA, and we think that the court of appeals misread that case in concluding that it barred standing, not because it lacks a holding that does bar standing of certain types of claims that allege an invasion of State sovereignty, but because the kind of claim that Petitioner is making is not a Tenth Amendment reserved rights claim, but instead an enumerated powers claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2026.065" offset="8209701">Missouri v. Holland was a case in which this Court adjudicated whether a law exceeded Congress's enumerated authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.021" offset="8241465">It did that at the behest of a State, but there is no reason why under cases like Lopez and Sabri and Perez that an enumerated powers argument is in any way off limits to a criminal defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2047.129" offset="8293919">If this case does go back down to the Third Circuit, a petitioner can make the argument that this law exceeds the enumerated powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.918" offset="8325057">We can rely on the Treaty Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.119" offset="8333939">It doesn't affect standing in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.154" offset="8341985">I think that the amicus in support of the judgment makes the assumption that because Missouri v. Holland is good law, there's no possible claim that Petitioner can make that the law would exceed Congress's enumerated authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.562" offset="8399663">Therefore, the amicus says this must be some sort of a special State sovereignty claim of a genre that looks like commandeering, perhaps not articulated quite light that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2087.870" offset="8456923">I think Petitioner confirmed today that's not what she's trying to do, and there is no Tenth Amendment claim based on a specific aspect of State sovereignty that Petitioner has ever made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.361" offset="8498824">In fact, if you look at Petitioner's brief in support of the rehearing petition, Petitioner said the Tenth Amendment argument raised by Bond was not critical to Bond's other constitutional challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.769" offset="8556502">It is ancillary to Bond's main argument that Congress acted outside of its enumerated powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2181.765" offset="8832460">The relevant standing doctrine in this case is the prudential rule against third-party standing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2222.656" offset="8996091">There is some circuit cases where a criminal defendant has tried to make a Tenth Amendment claim and the court has said no.</text>

            <text syncTime="2230.060" offset="9025661">We all agree, I think, to the extent you could really characterize her claim as an Article I enumerated powers claim, this Court has assumed many times that defendants have the standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.082" offset="9065785">This Court generally has not discussed it, but it has assumed it, and so there are cases that say no standing for a criminal defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.021" offset="9097550">She did make a Fifth Amendment due process vagueness challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.704" offset="9108208">If she had other Bill of Rights type claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.656" offset="9116045">Even the treaty power cases like Reid v. Covert recognize you could raise that kind of claim, but the Court's cases do distinguish between Tenth Amendment and other claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.197" offset="9158259">And a lot of the argument here is about what is on the Tenth Amendment side of the line, what is a lack of power, for a better word, whether it's -- there's an Article I, power doesn't reach it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.219" offset="9198279">And in particular I would point to the Heller case, which Petitioner mentions in her reply brief, but frankly is off by one page in the citation that the Court should focus on, pages 579 to '80.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.794" offset="9244568">The Court says</text>

            <text syncTime="2345.332" offset="9486775">One is, the usual rule of prudential third-party standing considers the alignment or lack of alignment between the interests of the third party making the claim and the party who is not present whose claim it really is.</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.601" offset="12143846">No, I'm not sure that's what I meant to say, Justice Alito.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.219" offset="12154295">What -- what I was trying to say is her argument is not -- well, I think her argument is in essence a challenge to the treaty power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.040" offset="12185537">It's one step removed, but it is a challenge to the treaty power, because she says the statute has to be based on something in Article I, section 8, first 17 clauses; and if it's based on something there, then the treaty power adds nothing to Congress's ability to enact legislation; and that's inconsistent with the plain language of the Necessary and Proper Clause, the fact that the treaty power is in Article II, not in Article I, section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.190" offset="12290132">And so under her view of the world -- as I understand it; I'm sure Mr. Clement will correct me if I'm wrong about my understanding -- is that really you don't need a treaty, the treaty doesn't add anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.515" offset="12335480">I mean, it may be the reason that Congress decides at this point in time to enact section 229.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.069" offset="12357736">But I believe, as I understood her argument, if it has the commerce power to do it, United States never entered -- needed to enter a treaty in order for Congress to enact section 229.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.258" offset="12398488">So in other words, as I understand her argument, the treaty power adds nothing to the domestic legislative authority of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="3102.211" offset="12514262">There are examples from the Eighth Circuit, from the Tenth Circuit involving criminal prosecutions where the Court characterized the claim as a Tenth Amendment claim and said, in light of TVA, the criminal defendant does not have standing to make that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.954" offset="12569224">So there are examples in the lower courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3119.672" offset="12584061">And I would say this, too, about the -- there's some argument about the separation of powers cases in which the Court has typically allowed individuals to make that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.928" offset="12617080">Again, because we're talking about prudential rules and third-party standing, or at least I'm talking about that, one prudential consideration is in those cases, whether it's Chadha, whether it's Clinton v. New York, the recent Free Enterprise case, the Federal Government is always very much present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.240" offset="12686357">It may be representing the defendant in those cases, it may simply intervene or come in as an amicus, it gets notice if the Federal statute is challenged as being unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.012" offset="12725436">The difference in the Tenth Amendment setting is there's no mechanism, practically, to notify the States or solicit the States for their interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="3261.910" offset="13153008">So if in a later case the State wants to in fact assert that this particular statute does intrude on our sovereignty, it's not that they can't necessarily raise the claim, but they will confront contrary precedent that the State never had a chance to -- to voice its opinion or its views at the time the issue was being adjudicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3307.455" offset="13335239">New York v. United States, for example, was a case where the State initially said we're not concerned about this regulation, and then changed its mind; and the Court in New York said States don't waive those Tenth Amendment rights; States can then -- can change its mind and bring a suit, and there's no indication--</text>

            <text syncTime="3416.605" offset="13771797">Just a few points in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.874" offset="13776917">First of all, one reason not to carve out a special rule for commandeering claims is that not all commandeering claims are created equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.079" offset="13809727">Mr. Dreeben raises the commandeering claim that has been litigated in the context of SORNA, the Sex Offender Registration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.816" offset="13836685">I don't know the details of that enough to know whether that's a valid commandeering claim or not, or whether there's a redressability problem in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.636" offset="13867928">But I can certainly imagine a commandeering case, a Federal statute that purports to commandeer local prosecutors to prosecute Federal crimes, where there would be no standing obstacle; and the problem is right now the lower courts aren't resolving the standing issue in the SORNA challenges based on a careful analysis of Article III standing, redressability or prudential standing, for that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.067" offset="13953714">They're resolving those challenges with a simple citation to Tennessee Electric and let's move on, and that's really what should stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.137" offset="13977955">A second reason that you should not try to carve out commandeering cases as being somehow the residuum of the Tennessee Electric dictum is because Tennessee Electric says nothing about commandeering cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.980" offset="14033335">It just talks broadly about Tenth Amendment claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.832" offset="14044724">You know, we can disagree or agree; it's kind of hard to figure out what the nature of the claim was in Tennessee Electric.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.403" offset="14071056">I don't think it was really much different from the claim that we're raising here, which is in Tennessee Electric they said, well, if the Federal Government gets to regulate power, what's left of State's traditional prerogative to regulate the price for power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.425" offset="14115150">Here is if the Federal Government can go in and prosecute you for putting vinegar in your neighbor's goldfish bowl, what's left of local law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.197" offset="14146184">I think they're very similar arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.764" offset="14152453">But whatever else is true, I just don't think Tennessee Electric limited itself to commandeering claims in any way that would allow you to say that Mr. Dreeben refers to the enduring force of Tennessee Electric.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.672" offset="14196130">With all due respect, I don't think Tennessee Electric has any enduring force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.307" offset="14210654">The central holding of this decision was overruled in Camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.675" offset="14224133">The further you go in the decision the less satisfying it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.275" offset="14234478">If you go all the way to reading the Georgia Power case cited in footnote 27 as Justice Breyer has done, and you look at the role of consent of the States, it turns out in the district court opinion, that's in the merits section of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.935" offset="14285155">The Court's already held contrary, actually, to the holding of Tennessee Electric that the utility companies there had standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.588" offset="14307725">So what you see is, you know what happens if you apply the legal interest test, you hopelessly conflate the merits and the standing question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.575" offset="14339699">That's kind of happened today in oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.377" offset="14346909">That's a bad approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.146" offset="14354014">The Court was right to get rid of it in Camp, and it should perfect the Camp decision by saying this sentence no longer survives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.466" offset="14379301">Two other minor points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.549" offset="14383585">One is on the Commerce Clause, I think Justice Alito shows why the Government was right never to make that argument below, but I do think it's important that if this Court says anything about the Commerce Clause issue, it doesn't somehow reinject it in the case in a way that would not allow us to argue that it has been clearly waived in the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.261" offset="14454429">The Government gets to confess air, it doesn't get to confess, oh, actually, we have a better argument to defend the statute that we've never raised before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.664" offset="14480029">Plain error should be a two-way street, and they should not be allowed to sneak the Commerce Clause back into the case at this late stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.151" offset="14506047">Finally, there is no difference between the separation of powers case and the Federalism case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.853" offset="14524855">The best example of that is this Court's Free Enterprise Fund case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.571" offset="14539692">When it wants a case to cite for the proposition that the Executive Branch cannot waive or acquiesce in a separation of powers violation, because the separation of powers is there to protect the individual, what does it cite?</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.113" offset="14585877">New York against United States.</text>
