            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">This case concerns the 120-day time limit for filing a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.156" offset="142043">The petitioner in this case, David Henderson was a veteran.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.251" offset="158448">He applied for veteran's benefits but those were denied by the Veteran's Administration so he filed a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court but he missed the 120-day deadline by a couple of days.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.565" offset="215709">He argued that his late filing should be excused because it was caused by his illness but the Veterans Court held that the 120-day time limit is jurisdictional and can't be relaxed under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.474" offset="283314">The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.631" offset="299928">As we explained in an opinion that is filed today, we hold that Congress did not intend that the 120-day time limit be treated as a jurisdictional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.976" offset="349351">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.404" offset="375056">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
