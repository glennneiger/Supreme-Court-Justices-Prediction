            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">This case concerns the proper interpretation of a federal fee-shifting statute called Section 1988, which allows the courts to award a reasonable attorney's fee to the prevailing party in certain civil rights lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.721" offset="173369">We have held in prior cases that the defendant may receive attorney's fees under the statute if the suit against him was frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.969" offset="210359">This case asks us to consider what happens when part of the suit but only part of the suit was frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.702" offset="245258">Is the defendant entitled to any fees and if so, how should they be calculated?</text>
            <text syncTime="41.105" offset="270858">The case arises out of an election for chief of police in the town of Vinton Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.558" offset="296667">The challenger Ricky Fox alleged that the incumbent Billy Ray Vice used an assortment of dirty tricks to try to force him out of the race.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.222" offset="339299">Vice's various machinations didn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.412" offset="352047">Fox won the election and Vice was ultimately convicted of criminal extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.603" offset="376811">But Fox, the winner of the election, went on to sue Vice and he asserted both state law claims like defamation and also federal civil rights claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.751" offset="429474">Vice, the defendant removed the case to federal court on the basis of the federal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.814" offset="457686">At the end of discovery, Fox, the plaintiff, admitted that his federal claims were not valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.680" offset="485167">And the District Court dismissed them, remanding the case to the state court to resolve the remaining state law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.244" offset="523410">Vice once again remember the defendant sought attorney's fees under Section 1988 on the grounds that Fox's federal claims had been frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.000" offset="570431">The District Court agreed with that and then granted Vice fees for all the work his attorneys had done on the suit, the entire suit, even though only Fox's federal claims were frivolous and his state law claims had yet to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.546" offset="636677">The Court of Appeals upheld that award.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.776" offset="649529">We now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.906" offset="658098">We presume that the federal claims here were frivolous and the state claims were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.046" offset="682653">And we agree with the courts below that the defendant may receive some fees in a mixed suit like this one where only some of the plaintiff's claims are frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.400" offset="732076">But he is entitled only to the fees he paid because of frivolous claims alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.018" offset="758512">He is not entitled the fees he would have paid anyway to defend against the nonfrivolous claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.689" offset="789232">The test can be stated as a 'but for' rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.530" offset="804592">He is entitled to the fees that he would not have paid but for the frivolous claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.965" offset="830297">This test comes directly from Congress' purpose in enacting the statute to relieve defendants of the burden associated with fending off frivolous litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.985" offset="878362">So if the defendant's attorneys would have done the same work anyway, even if the frivolous claims had not been in the suit then fee-shifting is not allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.899" offset="922039">If it were, defendants would be relieved of some of the costs of defending against normal nonfrivolous litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.005" offset="954431">And Section 1988 was never intended to give defendants that kind of windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.186" offset="983165">The courts below failed to adopt -- failed to apply this 'but for' test.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.112" offset="1006885">Fox's suit involved frivolous federal claims and nonfrivolous state law claims, but all of them were closely related arising out of Vice's conduct in the campaign and requiring proof of the same basic facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.501" offset="1068429">So even if Fox have filed only his state law claims, the nonfrivolous ones, it is likely that Vice's attorneys would have done much the same work, would have taken the same depositions, review the same documents and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.962" offset="1126316">And if that is so, Vice is not entitled to fees for that work.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.129" offset="1147005">Because the courts below failed to analyze the issue in this way, we vacate the judgment below and remand the case for application of the proper standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.053" offset="1190682">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
