            <label>Mr. Reuben C. Cahn</label>
            <text syncTime="8.720" offset="140267">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.795" offset="176630">When it instructed courts to recognize that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation, Congress intended to end the practice of sending defendants to prison so that they might get treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.785" offset="232532">The commands of 3582 are clear on this point: Do not imprison and do not lengthen prison sentences for the purposes of rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.958" offset="269208">This plain meaning is confirmed by the structure of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.862" offset="288852">Under the statute, judges have the power to sentence defendants to prison but not to prison programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.516" offset="315496">Judges once had that power under the Youth Corrections Act and under the Narcotic Addicts Rehabilitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.705" offset="344231">With the Sentencing Reform Act Congress took that power away.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.656" offset="360009">That structure makes sense only because Congress intended that defendants should no longer be sent to prison for purposes of rehabilitation.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="72.595" offset="395849">You have, in effect, a one-way ratchet.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.630" offset="407970">If the judge really thinks rehabilitation is a -- a -- a primary or an important component of the sentence, then it reduces the prison term.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.820" offset="448721">It could never increase it.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.720" offset="452274">So you have a one-way ratchet.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="reuben_c_cahn" startTime="87.855" stopTime="114.255">
            <label>Mr. Reuben C. Cahn</label>
            <text syncTime="87.855" offset="456871">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.105" offset="465857">I believe that that's correct, that the -- that the way in which the statute is set up, the logic of 3582 is that a need for rehabilitation can push the judge, the sentencing judge, into moving the individual either out of an incarceration sentence into probation or lower the sentence to get that individual into supervisory release where rehabilitation current -- concerns are properly addressed under the statute.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="114.255" offset="562406">Do you think that's -- do you think that's consistent with what Congress thought about rehabilitation when it adopted the Sentencing Reform Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="124.195" offset="602216">And you discuss their thinking, and I think accurately, in your brief, but was their thinking simply that rehabilitation is very feasible and it's reasonably predictable whether somebody can be rehabilitated or has been rehabilitated so long as it's done outside of prison, but it just doesn't work in prison?</text>
            <text syncTime="145.959" offset="689256">Was that their thinking?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Reuben C. Cahn</label>
            <text syncTime="146.810" offset="692705">Well, there's relatively little evidence of what Congress thought about the possibility of rehabilitating individuals outside of prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.230" offset="722380">What's clear is that they doubted that rehabilitation could be reliably induced in the prison setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.951" offset="745263">There is at least one comment that indicates that they doubt that we know enough about human behavior to rehabilitate individuals on a regular basis in any case, but they certainly--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="169.724" stopTime="193.541">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="169.724" offset="784342">But it is strange, isn't it, that they can take rehabilitation into account for the supervised release.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.996" offset="813390">I mean, that -- that's a provision, isn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="179.282" offset="822585">As far as supervised release is concerned, the judge can take account of rehabilitation in setting the length of the term, but can't do that for the prison time.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="reuben_c_cahn" startTime="193.541" stopTime="236.951">
            <label>Mr. Reuben C. Cahn</label>
            <text syncTime="193.541" offset="879532">--Well, certainly with regard to supervised release, we think, as far as setting the term of supervised release, the judge is required to take rehabilitation concerns into account, and that's because supervised release is intended to smooth the transition from prison to true liberty and is specifically a rehabilitative vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.419" offset="955079">Now, with regard to revocation, to the extent that that's -- that's at issue, we concur with the Solicitor General that 3582, by its terms, simply doesn't govern a revocation of supervised release because it's not the imposition of a term of imprisonment but, rather, requiring the individual to serve a portion of the supervised release term in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.416" offset="1043059">So, by its plain terms, it simply isn't applicable.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="236.951" offset="1053194">Counsel, aren't -- isn't punishment and rehabilitation often flip sides of each other?</text>
            <text syncTime="246.224" offset="1090288">If you read what the judge said here, his comment was this man -- or this woman, I'm sorry, has been involved in a series -- escalating series of serious offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.702" offset="1152251">Logically, she has to be put away for a long time unless she gets rehabilitation because there's going to be no deterrence otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.391" offset="1198958">And so, what the judge was basically saying, in my judgment -- and I don't know why it's not just the flip, which is without -- without drug treatment, we can't deter her.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.269" offset="1262488">And so, this crime, given her background, deserves this kind of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.225" offset="1302298">One of its by-products is a drug treatment program.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.593" offset="1315777">How different is that, or do you really think that a judge who knows that someone is going to get a rehab program if they serve 50 months and the sentencing range is between 45 and 55, do you think that they're going to take 50 -- they're not going to choose 50 if they understand that there's no chance for this person to be deterred without drug treatment?</text>

            <text syncTime="349.474" offset="1503336">That's the whole point, because what the judge said was if she doesn't get treatment, she needs to be in jail a long time because her crime was serious, because she's just going to continue committing crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.465" offset="1559239">There's a chance if she gets it that she won't, but without it, for sure, she's not, and this is the just punishment she deserves, this amount of years.</text>

            <text syncTime="476.304" offset="2010634">What about 3582, in using the word "recognizing", stops a judge from saying without something there's going to be no deterrence?</text>

            <text syncTime="783.519" offset="3239539">Well, Congress was intending to reject the prevailing rehabilitation model of sentencing, and under that model, defendants were kept in prison until they were declared rehabilitated based on their participation in treatment programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.510" offset="3295441">And what Congress determined was that -- that coercing participation in prison programs that way wasn't -- had failed and that rehabilitation couldn't be accomplished reliably in a prison setting.</text>

            <text syncTime="815.907" offset="3369002">The thinking was that -- that some people were being sentenced to coercive rehabilitation, but also that other people were being paroled before they should be on the theory that they had been rehabilitated.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.882" offset="3416963">It was a general skepticism about rehabilitation, and that is inconsistent with the idea that you can take rehabilitation into account in going down, but you can't take rehabilitation into account in going up.</text>

            <text syncTime="859.401" offset="3542977">That's reflected in section 3553(a)(2)(D).</text>
            <text syncTime="863.805" offset="3560636">But what Congress determined was that it -- that because you couldn't reliably induce it in prison, it wasn't appropriate to deprive defendants of their liberty, expend the resources on keeping them in prison for that purpose, but that -- that rehabilitation remained a possibility, that other forms of sentencing were appropriate ways to attempt to achieve rehabilitation, and that's why Congress expressly provided that, in imposing a sentence of probation, the court can require a defendant to participate in particular treatment programs--</text>

            <text syncTime="901.680" offset="3712146">Yes, but that's different from saying that a lower sentence can be imposed on the theory that with rehabilitation outside of prison, a lengthier sentence isn't needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.850" offset="3744852">Would you agree that when the guidelines were mandatory a judge could not sentence to -- to additional time, certainly not additional time outside the guideline range for the purpose of rehabilitation, but the judge also generally could not depart below the guideline range on the theory that this defendant had led a life of crime because the defendant lacked vocational skills or the defendant was dependent on drugs or alcohol, and with treatment outside of incarceration, those problems which had led to the criminality could be alleviated?</text>

            <text syncTime="984.000" offset="4041394">On the other hand, if the -- it was very important, if there were important purposes of protecting the public, deterring the defendant from committing other crimes, deterring generally, then the court was supposed to sentence the defendant to prison in accordance with that, even if the defendant also needed rehabilitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2056.278" offset="8330491">But he and the Senate report contrasted that with drug treatment, which is very different, because there's a diagnosed pathology, there is a criterion for success that's measurable, and there's a fixed limited time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.188" offset="8382213">And that third point is crucial here, because both Petitioner and the government in their argument said that you can't keep someone in jail tied to completion of programs or keep them in until he has been rehabilitated through treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2857.573" offset="11535715">And indeed, when we look at the case law in the circuits -- and we've surveyed the most recent 150 or so cases on rehabilitation in the courts -- we see very rarely -- first of all, we haven't found any cases where judges are putting someone into prison versus out based solely on this.</text>

            <label>Mr. Reuben C. Cahn</label>

            <text syncTime="3268.370" offset="13178922">Let me begin with a couple points about the plain language of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.589" offset="13195745">When a defendant is sent to prison so that he can gain access to rehabilitative programs, imprisonment is used as a means to promote rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.064" offset="13241720">Counsel stresses only the imprisonment portion of that sentence, but it is strictly speaking within the very prohibition that Congress has articulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.837" offset="13276724">Beyond that I would point to 3553(a)(2)(D), and counsel has left off the last few words in discussing that purpose of sentencing that's set out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.043" offset="13321550">Congress required that these rehabilitative resources be provided in the most effective manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.680" offset="13344120">As is discussed in the brief, Congress had determined with regard to in-prison rehabilitation programs that they simply were not the most effective manner.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="3318.968" stopTime="3411.247">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="3318.968" offset="13381319">Counsel, this makes a lot of sense when we're talking about huge disparities in a guideline sentence, versus one where the judge goes outside the guidelines or imposes a greater sentence than otherwise the guidelines would determine for rehabilitation purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.699" offset="13456238">But not infrequently guideline ranges are within very narrow scopes, and in fact there are some prison advantages that you get from being sentenced to a year and a day that you don't get if you're sentenced to 12 months; and district courts routinely will choose between a year and a day or 12 months based on knowledge about what might be available if you're there for over a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.401" offset="13579013">Why is that wrong?</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.420" offset="13587059">What would be the difference?</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.539" offset="13595627">You see, I'm having a hard time in this case, because if a judge comes in and says guideline range is 50 to 60, I think in the middle is perfectly fine, I just don't know whether I should give him 54 or 55 months, but I know that at 55 months there's this kind of program available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.083" offset="13673785">I'm going to do -- I'm going to -- you know, it is -- judging is not so precise that you know exactly where to go within the small ranges, and so there are many factors that influence that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.426" offset="13727075">Why should we announce a rule that says to a judge in those situations, don't give him that extra month?</text>

            <text syncTime="3411.247" offset="13750376">Because Congress has prescribed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.997" offset="13757377">Because Congress made the choice that it shouldn't be allowed; and it may seem unreasonable to all of us, but Congress made a determination that it wasn't appropriate to lengthen these sentences or impose them for purposes of rehabilitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3435.077" offset="13845776">Or would there possibly be situations in which one could infer that the desire to provide for rehabilitation in prison had influenced the sentence?</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.099" offset="13881825">For example, choosing a sentence that is just long enough to allow somebody to take advantage of a particular rehabilitation program in a -- in a prison, or where the judge goes on and on and on about the need for rehabilitation for this -- vocational training for this prisoner?</text>
