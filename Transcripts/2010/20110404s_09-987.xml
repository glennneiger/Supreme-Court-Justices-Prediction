            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">The Arizona Tax Code allows private individuals to claim dollar-for-dollar state tax credits for contributions to school tuition organizations, and these are called STOs.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.529" offset="162544">The STOs, school tuition organizations use the private contributions to provide scholarships to students attending private schools, and these include religious schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.059" offset="208624">A group of Arizona taxpayers sued the Director of the Arizona Department of Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.491" offset="226388">The taxpayers contend that the Arizona's STO tax credit constitutes a subsidy of religion in violation of Establishment Clause principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.148" offset="264944">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reached the merits of that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.525" offset="278528">It concluded that the taxpayers had stated a valid claim under the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.995" offset="296396">We now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.960" offset="304232">The Court cannot reach the merits of taxpayers Establishment Clause claims unless it finds that the Court has jurisdiction to resolve the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.266" offset="349477">And an essential element of federal jurisdiction is the requirement that the parties have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.795" offset="375599">They must show, not only that they've suffered an actual injury that was caused by the illegal action complained of, but also that the injury would be remedied by a judicial decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.954" offset="416246">Under Article III of the Constitution, standing is a necessary ingredient if any case or controversy appropriate for resolution in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.168" offset="453026">Case and controversies are constitutional terms that define an Article III jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.312" offset="485627">Respondents contend that they have standing to maintain this action for one and only one reason, because they are Arizona taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.332" offset="513735">But the mere fact that someone is a taxpayer, does not normally establish standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.931" offset="532125">In general, people do not have a continuing legal interest in ensuring that their tax payment -- payments are spent in a lawful manner, and this principle is well settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.114" offset="572876">Now, to overcome that general rule against taxpayer standing, respondents rely on an exception, and the exception is contained in a opinion announced by this Court in 1968, that's the case of Flast versus Cohen.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.361" offset="629823">Under Flast, individuals suffer a particular injury when in violation of the Establishment Clause and by means of the Tax Code, their property is transferred through the Government's Treasury to a sectarian entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.536" offset="682590">And as the Flast Court put it, "The taxpayers' allegation in such cases would be that his tax money is being extracted and spent in violation of specific constitutional provisions against such abuses of legislative power."</text>
            <text syncTime="157.638" offset="734939">Flast recognized that under the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, taxpayers suffer a unique injury, a violation of conscience, when their funds are extracted and spent in service of an establishment of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.080" offset="788752">Here, the respondents are taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.477" offset="798260">The STO tax credit does not extract and spend their funds in service of an establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.083" offset="820726">Rather, the taxpayers are free to pay their own tax bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.493" offset="834414">They could also contribute to a religious or secular STO of their choice, or they could obtain a different tax credit by making a different charitable contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.710" offset="871194">The STO tax credit is not tantamount to a religious tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.879" offset="891883">The Court's opinion today concludes that the taxpayers also fail to satisfy the other requirements for Article III standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.275" offset="917483">STO contributions result from the decisions of private taxpayers regarding their own funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.189" offset="937127">As a result, any injury the objectors may suffer would not be fairly traceable to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.640" offset="962936">And the court order, prohibiting operation of the STO tax credit, would not affect respondents or their tax payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.373" offset="989895">Because there is no jurisdiction to hear the taxpayers' lawsuit, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.047" offset="1012569">Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Thomas joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.275" offset="1029496">Justice Kagan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor joined.</text>
