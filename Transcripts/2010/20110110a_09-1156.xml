            <text syncTime="43.077" offset="277776">I mean, we know that the plaintiffs were able to identify -- there's some dispute whether it's 12 or 23, but do you represent that there were no other complaints made?</text>
            <text syncTime="58.770" offset="340470">So that, let's say, there has been discovery; now we're just at the pleading stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.240" offset="366383">The company would have said: That's it, we didn't have any more?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan Hacker</label>
            <text syncTime="80.166" offset="426047">That's true, but there's no allegation that what they -- what they know about or what they could find would have been a statistically significant difference between the rate of reported events and the background of--</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="93.343" stopTime="101.580">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="93.343" offset="478814">But why shouldn't that determination be deferred until there's discovery, and then we can know how many reports there really were?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan Hacker</label>
            <text syncTime="101.580" offset="511728">--Because it's incumbent on a plaintiff to come to court with a case, to plead the facts necessary to establish all of the elements of a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.435" offset="539209">And a securities fraud claim, of course, requires both materiality and scienter, and neither of those is established unless the company has knowledge of facts establishing a reliable basis for inferring that the drug itself is the cause of the reported event.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.612" offset="599918">Absent information like that, there is neither materiality nor scienter under the securities laws, because neither the company nor an investor -- until there's reliable evidence of a causal link between the two products, neither a company -- excuse me, a link between the product and the event -- neither the company nor investor would have any reason to think that an adverse event report is -- actually indicates a problem with the product, as opposed to a coincidence.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="148.394" offset="698974">Can there be some situations in which statistically significant evidence would not be necessary?</text>
            <text syncTime="154.464" offset="723320">For example, suppose some very distinguished physicians concluded based on clinical trials that there was a connection between a drug and a very serious side effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.189" offset="774207">Could that establish materiality?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan Hacker</label>
            <text syncTime="169.223" offset="782357">I think a distinguished physician would not conclude that there's a connection unless the clinical trials reveal a statistically significant difference between what they've seen and what they would expect to see were there no association.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.763" offset="828437">So there's that point, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.915" offset="833034">But the second point I would make is, we acknowledge there are a very narrow, limited number of circumstances under which a claim can be pled absent statistically significant evidence, but that's -- that's because doctors and researchers will conclude that there may be causation under narrow circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.529" offset="911506">For example, I think the most common set of criteria are the Bradford-Hill criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.064" offset="925717">But nothing like that is pled here, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.512" offset="1023519">So the -- is the question before us simply whether in isolation the adverse incidents would be enough, or is not the question whether those adverse incidents placed next to this study would be enough?</text>

            <text syncTime="247.891" offset="1096976">First, the plaintiffs have throughout this litigation framed their case as one based on the failure to disclose adverse event reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.894" offset="1128950">It's the number of adverse event reports that they say is the problem, and they're not saying that there was a study out there and that we failed to disclose the study.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.602" offset="1167820">But they say it's the fact of the adverse event reports.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan Hacker</label>
            <text syncTime="268.554" offset="1179627">Well, I think if you look at the -- to be clear, the study is not attached to the complaint, so there wasn't a basis in the complaint for saying the company was aware of a reliable study and here are the details of the study and they failed to disclose it.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.747" offset="1240440">And if you look at the study, there's really nothing there.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.964" offset="1249322">It's based on, primarily on a case study of one -- and again, this isn't in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.468" offset="1267294">It is attached to the red brief, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.651" offset="1276071">There's one case study of one man who is 55 year old -- 55 years old, which is the population most likely to experience anosmia.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.589" offset="1311807">You're more likely to get it when you're -- he's suffering from signs of lupus.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.755" offset="1628411">The point simply is, following up on the Chief Justice's question, that it does matter what the basis of the allegation, and is the evidence, the facts available to the company, reliable?</text>

            <text syncTime="1823.441" offset="7399173">Or do we do this with two isolated boxes: one, materiality, two, scienter, and we don't mix the analyses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1835.749" offset="7448388">They're both analytically distinct and related, Justice Kennedy, and I don't have a simple answer for you because many of the recorded cases raise issues of both materiality and scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.121" offset="7489870">What the Court has said in Basic is that the test is the total mix of information and whether that -- under that total mix the investor would find that information important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.013" offset="7533443">In Tellabs the Court said that whether or not the inferences of scienter could be deemed as plausible as other inferences based on the mental state of the people making the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.820" offset="7584747">So the Court has announced separate tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.320" offset="7594674">In a case like this there is a natural overlap, and in fact the other side has litigated this case on the basis that no one would have thought within the company, based on the adverse event reports, that there was a basis for thinking there was information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.180" offset="7662174">We plead the other way by saying that when you have three medical specialists in three distinct periods where the last wants to bring findings to the leading ear, nose and throat medical society suggesting that, based on studies that go back as far back as the 1930s, there is a scientifically plausible link based on the zinc ions, that's something that the company should have taken seriously and disclosed to investors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1941.215" offset="7870318">If the drug had been FDA approved and that report was then submitted to the FDA, I think that there's a closer call depending on the, you know, effect of the report that might be on the stock price, because that's the only company product and the other factors that we've mentioned in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2950.768" offset="11908535">Under the securities laws, there is no baseline duty to disclose for a manufacturer or a company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.088" offset="11933821">A company creates a duty to disclose once they have spoken.</text>

            <text syncTime="3248.206" offset="13098256">I think the SEC is due a significant deference based on, one, its long-standing historical practice in applying the materiality standard, which is part of its own rule, Rule 10b-5, and its special expertise in knowing what a reasonable investor would want to know based upon its experience in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.268" offset="13178504">So, I do think that to the extent there is any ambiguity remaining in this case, the Court should defer to the SEC's views.</text>

            <text syncTime="3369.300" offset="13582670">One, the PSLRA does have a safe harbor for companies once they make forward-looking statements, that if they add in meaningful cautionary language -- and this is in the PSLRA itself, section 5(c)(1)(A), that if they add in meaningful cautionary statements, then they cannot be subject to liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.230" offset="13666367">And I think there are a couple other scenarios that would -- would trigger, for example, if the product at issue is such a small percentage of the company's income or expected growth that no reasonable investor would care if it tanked, then that might be a circumstance where a motion to dismiss would be appropriate.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan Hacker</label>
            <text syncTime="3416.447" offset="13771170">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.580" offset="13775768">I would like to return to Justice Kennedy's question about the role of scienter here, which I think absolutely is critical as this Court emphasized recently in the Merck v. Reynolds case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.803" offset="13812652">Mr. Frederick correctly, I think, conceded that there has to be a scientifically plausible basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.707" offset="13832296">And what you're talking about here is the company's knowledge of a scientifically plausible basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.992" offset="13853403">And he has to make that concession in this case because of what is alleged to be the material omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.146" offset="13870017">The material omission is not knowledge of dubious scientific -- medical claims, it's not that we get one phone call from a doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.567" offset="13895722">The real material omission is that the adverse event reports told Matrixx that Zicam causes anosmia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.322" offset="13926755">That's ultimately the fact that -- that Matrixx supposedly did not disclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.857" offset="13944832">So there has to be a basis for believing that -- there has to be allegation in the complaint that sufficient to establish Matrixx actually knew that Zicam causes anosmia and yet willfully refused to tell investors that fact, and there's nothing in the complaint like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.367" offset="14002928">There's not -- you're not talking about a case where there was a failure to disclose the doctor's completely dubious untested claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.438" offset="14027170">It's not a case -- it's not the Satan case where you're talking about a media splash, a known fact that there is going to be a major media splash and the company knows for a fact that that splash is going to have the adverse effect on the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.346" offset="14074817">There is not even a claim here--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="3493.412" offset="14079101">Has that -- the solicitor general's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.363" offset="14086834">He wasn't actually even talking about causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.732" offset="14100313">He was talking about a statement you made about the company poised to double its growth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.605" offset="14131869">And I think he was saying that on the basis of what you had heard up until that time, you had to have known that that statement was misleading, as was the statement that this drug, that there was absolutely no proof or connection of causation, which was your scientific panel said you couldn't make that extreme statement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan Hacker</label>
            <text syncTime="3533.322" offset="14238657">--Well, two points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.088" offset="14241792">First, if the claim was about, you know, the consumer sales, you would need an allegation in the case that consumer product sales were actually affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.575" offset="14267705">There's no allegation like that, and the truth is they weren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.194" offset="14278154">And so you're not talking about falsifying any prior claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.396" offset="14291007">There's not even an allegation that that happened, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.462" offset="14299261">Second, with respect to the -- the statement, as I was discussing with Justice Ginsburg in the beginning part of the argument, the statement was what the scientific panel was addressing primarily was Jafek's claim that Zicam causes anosmia, and the company said accurately that that is completely unfounded and misleading because there is no scientific support for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.725" offset="14376270">You can't go out and claim that Zicam causes anosmia unless you have a scientific basis for that and the scientific panel was saying that isn't true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.895" offset="14405005">So the question is whether you can draw an inference of scienter from the fact that -- from what's alleged here, and there is simply no basis for an allegation, supportable allegation that the company knew it causes anosmia and nevertheless refused to tell investors that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.203" offset="14454220">Thank you.</text>
