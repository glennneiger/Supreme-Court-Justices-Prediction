            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to United States Court of the Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.376" offset="130968">Under the Armed Career Criminal Act, known as ACCA, a felon who unlawfully possesses a firearm is subject to a 15-year minimum prison sentence if he has -- has three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.400" offset="207036">As relevant here, the statute defines a serious drug offense as a state drug trafficking offense for which "a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more is prescribed by law".</text>
            <text syncTime="41.707" offset="272238">The question in this case is how a federal sentencing court should determine what maximum sentence is prescribed by law for a defendant's previous state drug offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.537" offset="323542">Petitioner Clifton McNeill pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.312" offset="354680">The District Court determined that ACCA applied based in part on McNeill's six prior state drug trafficking convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.832" offset="396790">McNeill argued that his prior convictions were not for serious drug offenses because, although those offenses each carried a 10-year maximum sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.051" offset="445586">When he was convicted of them, the State had since reduced the maximum penalty for those offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.214" offset="478292">The District Court rejected McNeill's argument and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.114" offset="501906">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals to determine the maximum term of imprisonment for prior state offense for ACCA purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.858" offset="552897">A federal sentencing court must consult the law that applied to the defendant's offense at the time of his state conviction for that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.100" offset="597828">The plain text of the statute allows no other interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.591" offset="615800">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
