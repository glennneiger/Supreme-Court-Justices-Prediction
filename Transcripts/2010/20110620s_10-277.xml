            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">This case is here on writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.249" offset="130445">It concerns one of the most expansive class actions in our history.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.861" offset="152910">Respondents, women who are current and former employees of petitioner Wal-Mart, brought this suit against the company on behalf of themselves and a nationwide class of some 1.5 million female employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.239" offset="218425">They alleged that Wal-Mart's local managers exercise their considerable discretion over pay and promotions disproportionately in favor of men in violation of the disparate impact and disparate treatment prohibitions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.035" offset="297524">Their suit seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, punitive damages and backpay.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.652" offset="328035">The District Court certified respondents' proposed class after finding that it satisfied the requirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="68.022" offset="377459">On appeal, the Ninth Circuit made a few modifications to the class but substantially affirmed the District Court's certification order.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.006" offset="413403">We granted certiorari to decide whether the class was properly certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.572" offset="435660">We conclude that it was not, for two independent reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.697" offset="460215">The first reason is addressed in Part II of my opinion for the Court, which is concurred in by the Chief Justice and Justices Kennedy, Thomas and Alito.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.904" offset="509012">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(2) requires a party seeking class certification to demonstrate that "there are questions of law or fact common to the class".</text>
            <text syncTime="116.007" offset="569407">To satisfy that Rule, a plaintiff's claims must depend upon a common contention that is capable of classwide resolution which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve in one stroke an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.151" offset="650073">Wal-Mart is the nation's largest private employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.024" offset="665537">It operates four types of retail stores throughout the country which are divided into seven nationwide divisions and subdivided into 41 regions of 80 to 85 stores apiece.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.650" offset="719976">Each store has between 40 and 53 separate departments and 80 to 500 staff positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.239" offset="754354">In all, Wal-Mart operates approximately 3400 stores and employs more than 1 million people.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.392" offset="791030">Because respondents wish to sue about literally millions of employment decisions at once, they need some glue holding the alleged reasons for all those decisions together.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.256" offset="842439">Otherwise, it will be impossible to say that an examination of all the class members' claims for relief will produce a common answer to the question that matters to Title VII, why was I disfavored?</text>
            <text syncTime="198.841" offset="900744">One of our prior cases, General Telephone Company of Southwest versus Falcon describes how the commonality issue must be approached.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.903" offset="941077">That case explained that there is a wide gap between an individual's claim of discrimination and the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same injury as that individual, so that the individual's claim and the class claim will share common questions of law or fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.913" offset="1017041">On the facts of this case, according to Falcon, bridging that game -- bridging that gap requires "significant proof" that Wal-Mart "operated under a general policy of discrimination".</text>
            <text syncTime="245.527" offset="1087572">That proof is entirely absent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.186" offset="1098125">As respondents acknowledge, Wal-Mart's official corporate policies forbid sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.519" offset="1127487">The only direct evidence of a general policy of discrimination respondents produced was the testimony of a sociologist, who concluded that Wal-Mart's strong corporate culture made the company "vulnerable" to gender bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.855" offset="1196868">But that sociologist admitted that he could not calculate whether -- "whether 0.5 percent or 95 percent of the employment decisions at Wal-Mart might be determined by stereotyped thinking".</text>
            <text syncTime="288.377" offset="1258935">So his testimony is worlds away from the significant proof of a discriminatory policy that Falcon requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.810" offset="1292685">Indeed, the only corporate policy that the plaintiffs' evidence convincingly establishes is Wal-Mart's policy of allowing discretion by local supervisors over employment matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.580" offset="1339705">On its face, of course, that is just the opposite of a human -- of a uniform employment practice that would provide the commonality needed for a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.838" offset="1376799">It is a policy against having uniform employment practices, that one particular supervisor exercises his discretion in a discriminatory way, does -- does nothing to establish -- be patient, that any other manager does so.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.620" offset="1475856">In a company of Wal-Mart's size and geographical scope, it is quite unbelievable that all managers would exercise their discretion in a common way without some common direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.974" offset="1525279">Respondents attempt to make that showing by means of statistical and anecdotal evidence, but reasons we explain in our opinion, their evidence falls far short.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.393" offset="1566971">We therefore first conclude that the plaintiff class was improperly certified under Rule 23(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="372.742" offset="1596437">The second independent reason why this certified class was improper is set forth in Part III of the opinion for the Court which is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.145" offset="1633949">The District Court certified this class under Rule 23(b)(2), which applies when "the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole."</text>
            <text syncTime="407.714" offset="1736244">But the plaintiffs' claims are not limited to the kinds of relief named in that Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.225" offset="1758292">Besides injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief, they seek awards of backpay that is money to individual class members.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.840" offset="1800819">We have previously expressed out that any monetary claims can be certified under Rule 23(b)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="431.234" offset="1830390">We need not resolve that broader question, however, because we conclude that at a minimum, claims for individualized monetary relief, like -- like a backpay at issue here, do not satisfy the Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.307" offset="1882634">As our opinion explains, the key to a (b)(2) class is the indivisible nature of the relief requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.194" offset="1914190">The notion is that the defendants' conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.836" offset="1956718">Just as (b)(2) does not authorize certification when each class member would be entitled to a different injunction, neither does it apply when each class member seeks individualized award of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.999" offset="2009381">That interpretation accords with the historical antecedents of -- of the (b)(2) and with the overall structure of the Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.987" offset="2045325">We conclude that class actions to recover backpay belong instead in Rule 23(b)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="492.878" offset="2076881">That Rule contains several procedural protections that the (b)(2) class does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.357" offset="2098824">Protections that are particularly important when individual money claims are at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.488" offset="2119408">In a (b)(3) class, the District Court is required to provide absent class members with notice of the lawsuit and an opportunity to opt-out of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.676" offset="2160159">And it is required to find that common issues predominate over individual issues, and that class treatment is a superior method of adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.631" offset="2199970">These findings are considered unnecessary to a (b)(2) class, but they are indispensable when individualized claims are at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.175" offset="2238109">The Fifth Circuit has suggested that monetary relief can be part of the (b)(2) class if it is incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.080" offset="2277710">We need not decide that question today because respondents' backpay claims are not incidental to anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.886" offset="2304982">Because Title VII provides Wal-Mart with certain statutory defenses to backpay that it is entitled to -- to litigate as to each employee, resolving those claims will require individualized determinations of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.896" offset="2373005">The Ninth Circuit believed it was possible to replace these proceedings, these individualize adjudications, with a sort of Trial by Formula under which, entitlement to backpay and the amount of entitlement would be calculated for a sample set of the plaintiffs and those results then extrapolated over the entire 1.5 million class.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.395" offset="2471016">We disapprove that project.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.179" offset="2478122">The Rules Enabling Act forbids interpreting the federal rules to "abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right" including Wal-Mart's statutory defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.421" offset="2531098">Wal-Mart is in entitled to litigate those defenses and the necessity of that litigation demonstrates that respondents' backpay claims are not incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.749" offset="2572372">For these and other reasons set forth more fully in our opinion, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.044" offset="2593583">Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justices Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan have joined.</text>
