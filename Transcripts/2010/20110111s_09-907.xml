            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">This case is about the proper interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.643" offset="128042">In what's called Chapter 13 Bankruptcy, a person can get relief from all his debts in exchange for an agreement, an agreement to repay his creditors a certain amount of his future income for the next several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.503" offset="187392">The Bankruptcy Code instructs a person in this situation how to calculate the exact amount that he has to repay his creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.631" offset="223963">The Code says to that person, first, you take your current income then you deduct certain defined living expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.308" offset="258654">Those defined expenses, the Bankruptcy Code says, are set amounts, not necessarily your actual expenses, but set amounts that the IRS decides are reasonable for various necessary things like housing, or transportation, or food.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.988" offset="329394">You deduct those expenses from your income and what's left over is the amounts that you are required to repay creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.933" offset="365129">Now, the issue in this case is whether the Bankruptcy Code allows a debtor, who's making this calculation, to deduct an expense that he simply does not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.047" offset="409642">The expense at issue is for car ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.931" offset="425106">The IRS, and again that's the agency that's authorized to set these reasonable expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.930" offset="453110">The IRS says that the average loan or lease payment for a car nationwide is $471 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.063" offset="485710">And so the IRS says, that's the amount that a person typically can deduct in Chapter 13 Bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.853" offset="520819">That's the amount of the car-ownership deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.740" offset="536388">The petitioner here, whose name is Jason Ransom, he claims this deduction even though he owned his car free and clear, and he didn't in fact make any loan or lease payments on this car.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.018" offset="593544">And claiming this deduction, allowed him to shield about $28,000 that he otherwise would've had to pay his creditors over the life of his bankruptcy plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.059" offset="641609">And he took the car-ownership deduction in addition to claiming another deduction that the IRS sets for car-operating costs like fuel, and insurance, and repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.962" offset="693227">So one of his creditors, perhaps not surprisingly, objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.410" offset="711095">That creditor said that Mr. Ransom wasn't eligible to claim the car-ownership deduction because he didn't in fact incur any car-ownership costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.242" offset="758429">Today, we hold that this was a valid objection, that Mr. Ransom was not entitled to this deduction under the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.275" offset="802523">We reached this conclusion by looking closely at the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.094" offset="821750">The statute authorizes a debtor to deduct, “His applicable monthly expense amounts that are set by the IRS.”</text>
            <text syncTime="189.108" offset="861874">"Applicable," if you go and you look it up in the dictionary, means appropriate, or relevant, or fit and we conclude that when the statute says, “Applicable expense amounts”, what the statute means is the expense amounts or deductions, that's another word for it, the deductions that are appropriate for that debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.462" offset="947242">And the deductions that are appropriate for that debtor are the ones that correspond to his own financial circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.177" offset="982141">So a person who doesn't have any car-ownership expenses can't take a deduction for car ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.332" offset="1014742">We also think that this understanding of the statutory language accords with the context and purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.711" offset="1044313">Other provisions of the statute made clear that Congress intended the deductions to approximate the debtor's reasonable expenditures on basic necessities.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.868" offset="1088930">And Congress' essential purpose in enacting this part of the Code was to ensure that debtors who can pay creditors do pay them.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.502" offset="1127382">So once again, we think this means that a person like Mr. Ransom who doesn't have any car-ownership expenses shouldn't be able to deducts them when calculating how much he has available to repay creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.897" offset="1196972">We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which previously disapproved this deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.902" offset="1233021">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
