            <text syncTime="14.574" offset="164697">There are three main points I wish to emphasize to the Court this morning: First, because the California Supreme Court rejected Mr. Pinholster's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on its merits, Federal habeas corpus relief is unavailable under 28 U.S.C. section 2254(d)(1) unless Mr. Pinholster first met his burden of demonstrating that the State court rejection of his claim was unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.260" offset="275456">He did not do that in this case, and thus the lower courts erred in granting him habeas corpus relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.064" offset="302728">Second, because Mr. Pinholster never even alleged, let alone proved, that he could not have presented the factual basis upon which the Ninth Circuit predicated its decision to grant relief when he was in the State court, 2254(e)(2) should have been a barrier to the State court Federal evidentiary hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.441" offset="1308233">But in terms of the new facts -- and let's be clear that 2254(d)(1) is a rule that says that relief cannot be granted if the State court determination was unreasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="641.994" offset="2674437">Prior to the passage of AEDPA, lower Federal courts were free to look to their own prior precedent, the prior precedent of the circuit courts, to say that the State court determination of a question of law was unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.366" offset="2715920">In both statutes -- statute subdivision (d)(1), which has to do with questions of law and mixed questions, the additional language narrowed the focus to a new and more limited basis for Federal review or to find the State court determination unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.395" offset="2788018">In (d)(2), there is this symmetrical limiting language which overturned what had historically been several bases for rejecting a State court factual determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.071" offset="2838695">But in both sections, the law is clear that the examination is of the application that was conducted by the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.979" offset="2894388">The section itself speaks in the past tense, and the very concept of reasonableness compels the conclusion that the State court determination can only fairly be read in light of -- in light of the facts that were squarely presented to the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.793" offset="2969621">Otherwise we could be in a situation where all of the facts before the State court are entirely removed, an entirely new set of facts are proven up in the Federal court, and we're going to say that, notwithstanding that wholesale change in the factual basis of the claim, that the State court determination was not merely wrong, but unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.206" offset="3051227">And it is this notion of unreasonableness, and it is the primacy of the State court determination of the claim that is the central feature of the AEDPA reforms to Federal habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.514" offset="3096472">The point was to make State court determinations the primary forum for adjudicating Federal constitutional claims, and Federal courts were only supposed to interfere in those determinations reluctantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.356" offset="3155822">And if you examine the language of AEDPA, you will see that in -- in many respects it mirrors the language of 2244, the "second or successive" language in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.097" offset="3206813">The purpose of AEDPA was to enforce upon Federal courts the same respect for State court determinations of claims that Federal courts showed to their own prior State court determinations of claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="797.860" offset="3297928">And here they put very specific language in the statute that was designed to ensure that when a Federal court is examining a State court determination of a claim, it limits itself to only those facts that were before the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.536" offset="3356547">And indeed this Court has specifically said so in Holland v. Jackson, that the (d)(1) determination is done in light of the record before the State court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3575.087" offset="14406760">We have to say that was wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="3581.340" offset="14431838">Then to get home, we then have to look at the new evidence, and there it's some combination of: A, there was nothing to have a hearing about, because there is nothing here that lets you have a hearing; or B, there was something to have a hearing about because this was so new that it was a new claim, and you should have gone to the State court first on that one, but there is no room to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.087" offset="14518774">They don't let you do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.106" offset="14522849">So okay, judge in the Federal court, you have the hearing.</text>
