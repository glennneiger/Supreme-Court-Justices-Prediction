            <text syncTime="7.387" offset="134938">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.606" offset="143820">The mandatory nationwide class in this case was improperly certified for two fundamental reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.760" offset="168479">First, plaintiffs failed to satisfy Rule 23(a)'s cohesion requirements as reflected in the commonality, typicality, and adequacy requirements of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.881" offset="208917">Second, plaintiffs' highly individualized claims for monetary relief failed to satisfy Rule 23(b)(2)'s requirements for certification of a mandatory non-opt-out class.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.673" offset="256146">Regarding Rule 23(a), because the plaintiffs' claims in this case hinge on the delegation of discretion to individual managers throughout the country, they cannot meet the cohesion requirements that are reflected in -- in Rule 23(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="53.135" offset="318004">The delegation of discretion in some ways is the opposite of cohesive claims that are common to everyone in the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.055" offset="345590">The common policies that the plaintiffs point to are either neutral and not argued to be discriminatory or they are affirmatively nondiscriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.012" offset="393446">The company has a very strong policy against discrimination and in favor of diversity.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="76.147" offset="410060">I suppose if corporate headquarters had learned that the subjective decisionmaking or the delegation of decisionmaking to the field was resulting in several discriminatory practices or a pattern of discrimination -- in other words, the decentralized process was leading to discrimination -- then I suppose the company -- that that could be attributed to the policy adopted by -- at headquarters?</text>

            <text syncTime="111.053" offset="549658">No, I'm talking about -- so, they've got thousands of stores, and, you know, every week they get a report from another store saying that, you know, there's an allegation of gender discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.993" offset="585394">At some point, can't they conclude that it is their policy of decentralizing decisionmaking that is causing or permitting that discrimination to take place?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="theodore_j_boutrous_jr" startTime="128.932" stopTime="178.096">
            <label>Mr. Theodore J. Boutrous Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="128.932" offset="621129">--That -- I think that would be an inquiry, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.915" offset="629070">I don't think it would rise to a pattern or practice or a common policy that affects everyone in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.919" offset="649132">Certainly, companies do look at the -- the situation throughout the company and seek to root out discrimination, but it would take more than some reports, especially in -- in a company that has so many stores and so many units.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.428" offset="703154">And here, the plaintiffs' claims simply aren't typical.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.147" offset="717991">If the three named plaintiffs stand before the court, they are supposed to represent 500,000 or a million or more people and stand in judgment -- that's the words the Court used in Hansberry v. Lee -- to represent all those other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.974" offset="777341">And the claim is that the individual decisionmakers in those other cases exercised their discretion in a way that was biased, and there's no proof of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="178.448" offset="819242">The Chief Justice's question reminds me somewhat of our rule in Monell under 1983: A city is not liable for a -- a constitutional violation unless it has a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.987" offset="865322">Would you think that we could use that as an analogue to determine whether or not there is a common question here?</text>

            <text syncTime="199.878" offset="904923">I think the analogue is that if a company had a policy, a general policy, of discrimination as opposed to here, where it's a general policy against discrimination, and it was -- in the words of the Court in Feeney, saw patterns throughout the company and because of sex, because of gender, continued to allow the patterns to exist, that would raise a different question.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.042" offset="989560">Suppose, following the Monell analogue, there's -- it's a -- there's a showing of deliberate indifference to the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.878" offset="1020907">Would that be a policy?</text>

            <text syncTime="230.397" offset="1026968">Your Honor, I think deliberate indifference raises a different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.115" offset="1041910">Under a disparate treatment claim, again, in Feeney, the test would be, was the company allowing the discrimination to occur because of gender, because it wanted there to be discrimination?</text>
            <text syncTime="245.490" offset="1087363">There's no evidence of that here.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.513" offset="1123516">The company gets reports month after month showing that women are disproportionately passed over for promotion, and there is a pay gap between men and women doing the same job.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.211" offset="1214213">It happens not once, but twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.194" offset="1222154">Isn't there some responsibility on the company to say, is gender discrimination at work, and if it is, isn't there an obligation to stop it?</text>

            <text syncTime="302.594" offset="1315777">But here, for example, if one looks at the aggregated statistics that the plaintiffs have pointed to, it points to a completely different issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.782" offset="1348587">It does not show that there were gender gaps at the stores among comparable people.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.250" offset="1366455">That's really the fundamental flaw in their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.952" offset="1377217">Their argument is that individual decisionmakers throughout the country were making stereotyped decisions and that that had a common effect, but they just added everything together.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.542" offset="1415565">They haven't shown a pattern across the map.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.308" offset="1422670">They've added all the data together and pointed to disparities, some of which mirror some of the -- the statistics that--</text>

            <text syncTime="341.349" offset="1470840">He did it regionally, not store by store, as your expert did, number one; and, number two, that he performed, as accepted by the district court, and affirmed by the circuit court, any number of controlled variable comparisons, including job history, job ratings, and other things, and found that the disparity could not be explained on any of the normal variables that one would expect and that the disparity was significantly much higher than the 10 competitors of Wal-Mart and what they were paying their labor force.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.240" offset="1634367">So, what is speculative about that, number one?</text>
            <text syncTime="386.378" offset="1650981">And, two, why is that kind of statistical analysis inadequate to show that a policy of some sort exists?</text>

            <text syncTime="405.856" offset="1728825">But even if he had, these statistics go more to the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.129" offset="1761949">Well, that begs the legal question, which is -- you're right.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.349" offset="1778772">Ultimately, you may win and prove to a factfinder that this analysis is fatally flawed, but what the district court concluded was that on the basis of your expert, whom he discounted because your expert was -- was basing analysis on -- on premises that the court found not acceptable, that there was enough here after a rigorous analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.667" offset="1888068">What's the standard that the court should use in upsetting that factual conclusion?</text>

            <text syncTime="461.609" offset="1951807">The standard that we think would govern would be the standard that the Second Circuit adopted in the IPO case, which says there needs to be a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.365" offset="1978870">When you're talking about discretionary decision around the country by different decisionmakers, there has to be some demonstration that there's a common effect throughout the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.602" offset="2011784">Our expert's report and testimony showed that at 90 percent of the stores, there was no pay disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.875" offset="2040936">And that's the kind of -- and even putting that aside, the plaintiffs needed to come forward with something that showed that there was this miraculous recurrence at every decision across every store of stereotyping, and the evidence simply doesn't show that.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.533" offset="2091510">The -- the other problem on the -- on the cohesion analysis is that -- again, the typicality inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.888" offset="2124946">Each of the plaintiffs have very different stories.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.573" offset="2135709">One of them was promoted into a managerial position.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.025" offset="2145531">One was terminated for disciplinary violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.644" offset="2159950">One was promoted and then had a disciplinary problem and then was demoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.362" offset="2178863">In each of these cases, if this were an individual case, they would have to show that they were treated differently than people who were situated just like them, with the same supervisor, the same department, the same situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.195" offset="2378230">And -- and one -- their argument is that the common policy is giving tens of thousands of individuals discretion to do whatever they want.</text>

            <text syncTime="614.824" offset="2564744">They argue that it was excessive subjectivity and that there were general overarching company standards that exerted control.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.061" offset="2597658">On page -- I think it's on page 13 of their brief, they say the discretion was unguided.</text>
