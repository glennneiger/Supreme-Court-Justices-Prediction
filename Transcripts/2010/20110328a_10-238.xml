            <text syncTime="15.510" offset="167434">This case is about whether the government may insert itself into elections and manipulate campaign spending to favor its preferred candidates.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.911" offset="1317031">The -- the effect of this law is considerably harsher than the law at issue in Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.482" offset="1339392">In Davis, the non-millionaires' candidate still had to go out and actually raise the funds that the Millionaires' Amendment permitted him to raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.353" offset="1378785">In this case, the law provides direct government subsidies, based on my act of speaking, to my political opponents.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.978" offset="1425283">What the expenditure triggered in Davis was a discriminatory restriction that would never be allowed in and of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.917" offset="1461123">What the law triggers here is something that, as Justice Ginsburg said, the government could do from the get-go, which is subsidize the speech of a candidate who decides to participate in a public financing system.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.497" offset="1543356">So to the extent that Davis relied on the fact that there was a discriminatory treatment of speakers in the same race, this case -- this law replicates and actually exacerbates the harm that was at issue in Davis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2620.962" offset="10589247">And secondly, the candidates made a choice, and if you're the person who is -- who supports the participating candidate, you can't make a contribution to that candidate, while you could to the other candidate because of the choice that was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.038" offset="10645567">And you can be responded to, if you run an ad criticizing the non-participating candidate, you can be responded to with unlimited amounts of money from -- taken from a political party, the person's own money, whereas, too, if you attack a privately financed candidate, you would only be subject to being potentially responded to with limited matching funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.135" offset="10725919">And it all flows from the voluntary choice that is made at the outset by the candidates about which system of financing is better for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.557" offset="10763640">And this is a system, the matching funds system, is a mechanism that the State uses in order to be able to offer viable public funding to candidates without wasting public resources, and both the logic and evidence demonstrates that it is, in fact, effective, both at promoting speech by encouraging candidates to run and, indeed, particularly resulting in more competitive races for incumbents -- against incumbents in Arizona and promoting speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.260" offset="10886416">And I would just like briefly to address Justice Alito's question about the ex ante measurement of the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.497" offset="10911389">Now, of course, we would submit that it's not relevant because we're not in -- should not be in strict scrutiny and therefore don't need to show this is the least restrictive means, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.668" offset="10944094">But, Justice Alito, an ex ante system would run substantial risks of underfunding or overfunding races, and in particular -- and therefore wouldn't serve the State's interest in saving money or in properly measuring -- but, in particular, would run the risk of having an incumbent who might have been in office for several terms unopposed and not having spent any money in those races, and now you are measuring how much his possibly now viable challenger will get in public funding based upon some minuscule amount of money that the incumbent has needed to spend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.372" offset="11066870">So I think that that would not serve the State's interests in ensuring the candidates actually have viable public funding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2789.103" offset="11261848">Every House district in Arizona has two -- has two members, so every general election has at least four candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.274" offset="11282536">And it simply is not the case that running an ad in support of a publicly financed candidate does not trigger matching funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.029" offset="11313570">It depends not on what the ad says, not even on who the candidate is being supported, but on whether another candidate in the race takes public financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.885" offset="11348992">So money spent to support one publicly financed candidate may trigger matching funds to another.</text>

            <text syncTime="3489.310" offset="14062696">Mr. Maurer, Davis starts off by saying that if what had been triggered was not an inequitable contribution limit raised but instead both a contribution raised for both candidates, that would have been perfectly appropriate, notwithstanding that that would have put many independent funders to a real choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.604" offset="14135839">The independent funder says, well, I'm not taking any contributions, so that's only going to help my opponent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3514.358" offset="14162902">I think what this Court was recognizing in Davis is that when the -- when the government relaxes restrictions on free speech, when there's more freedom, that doesn't constitute a violation of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.249" offset="14214416">That's not what the government is doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.285" offset="14222566">It's effectuating its goal of limiting spending in leveling the playing field by burdening and disincentivizing people to engage in their First Amendment rights.</text>
