            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">The second case is the opinion for the Court in Sorrel versus IMS Health.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.042" offset="137550">Companies that manufacture brand-name prescription drugs, higher marketers to promote their products.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.588" offset="167748">Some of these marketers visit doctor's offices to discuss the details and benefits of various pharmaceuticals.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.825" offset="196692">So these direct marketers are called “detailers”.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.782" offset="212574">Sales persons are often more effective when they are familiar with the preferences of their customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.189" offset="234203">Pharmaceutical sales persons, including the so-called “detailers” are no exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.346" offset="254788">They use information regarding doctors past prescription decisions to concentrate their presentations on information that is most relevant to the individual doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.627" offset="299928">This information called “prescriber-identifying information” is collected by pharmacists.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.327" offset="326677">Pharmacists sell this information to data miners.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.311" offset="342664">These are firms that analyze the data and produce reports on individual prescription decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.952" offset="369204">Pharmaceutical manufacturers and the detailers then purchase the information from the data miners.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.200" offset="394177">In 2007, Vermont enacted a law that place limits on the disclosure and use of prescriber-identifying information.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.510" offset="431480">The measure prohibits pharmacists from selling the information and from disclosing it for marketing purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.907" offset="457080">The law also forbids pharmaceutical manufacturers from using the information for marketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.225" offset="486337">Some Vermont data miners, and in association of pharmaceutical manufacturers, filed suit arguing that the law violated their First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.794" offset="524581">The United States District Court for the District of Vermont denied relief, but the Second Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.688" offset="548195">We now affirm the judgment of the Court of the Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.106" offset="565854">Vermont's law raises serious First Amendment concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.678" offset="580169">It imposes burdens based on the content of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.372" offset="594902">Under Vermont's law, pharmacists may disclose prescriber-identifying information for many purposes including, for example, healthcare research.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.979" offset="629384">But the law forbids pharmacists from selling or disclosing the information for marketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.312" offset="650700">The law also imposes a restriction based on the identity of the speaker by preventing drug manufacturers from using the information for marketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.860" offset="684868">Under the First Amendment, Vermont must justify these contents and speaker-based burdens on expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.450" offset="711199">We conclude the State cannot do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.866" offset="720917">Vermont suggest that its law protects the confidentiality of doctor's prescription decisions, but the law allows for the widespread disclosure and user-prescriber-identifying information and so does not advance any interest in confidentiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.116" offset="777864">Vermont also suggests that this law will prevent detailers from selling so many brand-name drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.971" offset="801270">In the States' view, that outcome is desirable because brand-name drugs are expensive and pose special health risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.844" offset="828750">The States' argument, however, is contrary to basic First Amendment principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.736" offset="844319">The Government may not strive to keep its citizens in the dark so that they will make decisions the State prefers.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.314" offset="866680">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.650" offset="875980">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Ginsburg and Kagan joined.</text>
