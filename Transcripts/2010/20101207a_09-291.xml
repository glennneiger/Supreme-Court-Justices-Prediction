            <text syncTime="7.620" offset="136903">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.939" offset="146202">704(a), Title VII, prohibits the use of third party reprisals as a method of retaliating against a person who complained to the EEOC or otherwise opposed discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.615" offset="200955">The text of Section 704(a) doesn't limit the types of retaliation which are forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.019" offset="234496">The elements of the statute are unrelated to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.673" offset="253095">The first requirement is that the plaintiff show that discrimination occurred with regards to the individual who engaged in a protected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.945" offset="290189">In a case like that, like this, that's shown by -- would be shown by evidence that they singled out Ms. Regalado and Ms. Regalado's fiancee.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.503" offset="332507">They didn't go fire anybody else's fiancee.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.455" offset="344315">That was the basis on which this particular action was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.990" offset="358421">Secondly, the plaintiff must show that the conduct was discrimination against the person who engaged in protected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.779" offset="397605">That language is easily applicable to a situation where you single out, say, a family member or a fiancee.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.135" offset="430937">The purpose of that, the complaint can fairly be read to allege, was to punish the person who had engaged in protected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.891" offset="466045">There are a number of Federal statutes that use the word "against" in precisely this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.378" offset="487988">They say that actions cannot be taken to -- say, against a family member of a sitting judge or other Federal official where the purpose is to act against the official.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.005" offset="1678440">Well, Your Honor, I think that there are two other limitations that would be applicable here, as indeed they would have be under Title VIII.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.694" offset="1709265">First one is proximate cause, which will cut off a lot of injuries down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.014" offset="1730476">And Title VII is adopted against a background of proximate cause rules, and there, I don't think -- we don't contend that in using the word "person aggrieved" they meant -- Congress meant to set those aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.822" offset="1781781">Secondly, the -- I think a fair reading of the word "aggrieved" is that it is -- "aggrieved" is both, in ordinary English, frankly, broader and narrower than "injured".</text>
            <text syncTime="431.213" offset="1831309">It is broader -- and that's, of course, not your concern -- in the sense that it covers people who haven't been injured yet but might be injured in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.069" offset="1866731">But it also has a second element, which is that the action at issue involves some sort of a wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.726" offset="1909363">If someone deliberately knocks me down, I'm injured, I'm probably aggrieved, but not if I'm carrying a football in the middle of a football game.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.899" offset="1946039">That's a legitimate thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.682" offset="1953144">So I think that there has to be a wrong, and the wrong has to be the basis of the plaintiff's objection.</text>

            <text syncTime="2985.588" offset="12048844">According to the EEOC statistics, in 1992, when data first began being collected, 14.5 percent of charges filed with the EEOC were retaliation claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.395" offset="12091998">By 2009 that had risen by 31 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.847" offset="12105791">In the Chamber's brief on page 2, they submit or recite to a study that was published in 1994 saying that the average cost to defend an employment litigation in 1994, when the study was published, was $120,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.857" offset="12165872">In this case what Thompson would propose is to give protected party to a wide range of people; and with respect to the government's position today, at the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals they advocated that there would be no limitation, that everyone would get the protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.784" offset="12225536">That's a broad -- that is a lot of protection for people, and I can tell you that employers who are faced with someone in a protected party, they are -- employers are reluctant to take adverse decisions against them; they're reluctant to implement discipline; they will postpone implementing that decision because they know at some point they're going to have to establish a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.899" offset="12326055">When we -- when we point out -- when we point this out in our arguments, the response by Eric Thompson as -- as to who gets the protection, it's in his footnote on page 4 at his reply, he says that the identity of individuals who might have a claim is a function of the employer's own intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.663" offset="12409125">So, in other words, in order to determine whether someone has protection, you have to look at the employer's intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.335" offset="12435769">So there are no protected parties anymore until the employer can establish that they had no intent -- or the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.922" offset="12466176">Everyone is protected party until the employer can show that he had no intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3156.466" offset="12732312">That is going to shift the burden to the employer at the outset of the case to prove that there was no retaliation, that there was no intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.655" offset="12765017">Your Honor, in conclusion, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.677" offset="12805141">The Sixth Circuit determined that Eric Thompson who was not discriminated against had no protection under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.348" offset="12831786">This Court clearly held in Burlington that the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII is designed to protect employees based upon what they do, based upon their conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.556" offset="12876716">In this case Eric Thompson engaged in none of that behavior, he had no conduct, he did not come forward on behalf of anyone; yet he is here asking for remedies, remedies that really should belong to Regalado.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.046" offset="12922587">There is no reason that Regalado could not have brought this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.898" offset="12934081">There -- if the concern is that employers are going to discriminate against employees, the response to that is that employers will still be held liable and can still be held liable, and that is by the person who is discriminated against from bringing the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.242" offset="12995417">We ask that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals decision be affirmed.</text>
