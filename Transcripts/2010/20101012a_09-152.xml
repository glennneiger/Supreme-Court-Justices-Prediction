            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="12.058" offset="151594">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.658" offset="162043">This case involves a vaccine designed in the 1940s that was administered to Hannah Bruesewitz in 1992, some 30 years after scientists discovered a safer way to design the pertussis component of the DTP vaccine.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.103" offset="223796">The Third Circuit held that the Bruesewitzes could not pursue a design defect claim under State law invoking the preemption principle in claiming that the Vaccine Act of 1986 preempted the Bruesewitz's State law claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.028" offset="287535">That holding is in error for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.230" offset="300283">First, the court overlooked the numerous provisions of the Act protecting manufacturers from liability, but it did not expressly preempt design defect claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.871" offset="354826">Second, the court misconstrued the word 22(b)(1)'s Federal law defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.394" offset="384920">And third, the court adopted a policy that exposes children to unnecessary safety risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.463" offset="413236">With respect to the first reason, in the 1986 Act Congress created a program, the vaccine program, that was funded by surcharges on the vaccines that users used, and out of that fund designed a program to pay compensation to persons who were injured by vaccine-related acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.227" offset="496306">Congress also provided a mechanism for exhaustion through the vaccine court program before a person claiming injury could pursue a State law cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.119" offset="543848">In creating Federal law defenses to the State law that was designed to govern such actions, Congress established certain defenses, but all of those defenses apply on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.610" offset="597765">There are no absolute provisions that preclude a State law claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.247" offset="616364">The Third Circuit misunderstood that basic principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.132" offset="631933">The defenses that the Vaccine Act created for manufacturers includes such things as a regulatory compliance defense for failure to warrant claims, a learned intermediary doctrine that is instituted at a national level, the imposition of comment k--</text>

            <text syncTime="147.808" offset="694627">What is -- I'm sorry, Mr. Frederick.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.391" offset="696926">What's the point that you are trying to make?</text>
            <text syncTime="150.926" offset="707062">That because there are a whole bunch of provisions designed to help manufacturers, that this one can't possibly also be designed to help manufacturers?</text>

            <text syncTime="160.282" offset="744469">--My point is that when one looks at the specific language of 22(b)(1) against the backdrop of these other provisions, it's clear what Congress was intending was to enact a national defense, but not to displace State law completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.875" offset="806849">And the question presented is whether, on a case-by-case basis, the design defect claims that had been brought by the Bruesewitzes are displaced as a matter of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.766" offset="850422">I would have thought the argument would go the other way: That because they set up a compensation scheme, that was a good sign that they didn't want to allow State law claims.</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="195.539" offset="885530">And if one looks, Mr. Chief Justice, at sections 21, 22, and 23 of the Act, what 21 provides is that the Claimant can elect not to accept the vaccine court judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.847" offset="934745">Section 22 provides the standards of responsibility, and section 23 provides the mechanisms for trial of the State law claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.968" offset="975287">And 23(e) provides that the evidence of the vaccine table and what happens in the vaccine court shall not be admissible in the State law claim.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="228.840" offset="1018755">Section 22(b)(1) refers to side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.964" offset="1067238">If the term "unavoidable" was intended to carry its ordinary meaning, what need was there for the rest of that language:</text>
            <text syncTime="251.253" offset="1108407">"Even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings? "</text>
            <text syncTime="257.055" offset="1131604">If it was improperly prepared or didn't have the proper directions and warnings, then the side effects are avoidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.811" offset="1158666">So that language is surplus, isn't it, if "unavoidable" really means unavoidable?</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="268.863" offset="1178833">What Congress was intending to do, Justice Alito, was, with the word "unavoidable", to use a word that had a settled meaning in the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.451" offset="1213210">And that settled meaning referred to the design of the product in light of the current state of scientific knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.890" offset="1238915">That grew directly from comment k, the section 402A of the restatement of torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.025" offset="1259499">And in comment k, which tracked the structure of the restatement provision itself, the general rule for the restatement was strict liability for dangerous products, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="300.583" offset="1305684">"although the drug is properly manufactured or properly warned against. "</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="307.319" offset="1332642">But isn't it true that at the time, there was a distinct minority view that you could not recover for design defects for vaccines?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="316.342" stopTime="368.941">
            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="316.342" offset="1368691">There certainly was a debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.208" offset="1376214">The majority view, however, was to adopt comment k as a defense to strict liability claims on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.698" offset="1410173">And the cases that we've set forth, I think, illustrate that, even the cases that the other side cites.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.768" offset="1434415">Several of them had been overruled by the time the 1986 act took effect and there was a decided shift in favor in the case-by-case application of comment k.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.874" offset="1470882">And in the 1987 report, Congress made very clear it intended to preserve that case-by-case approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.027" offset="1499512">That is set forth at page 50 of our brief, Justice Alito.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.146" offset="1511946">So when one looks at both the words that Congress used in 22(b)(1), the debates that occurred, and the committee reports that explained what Congress is intending here, we believe the intent is unmistakably clear to adopt comment k as a defense to--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="368.941" offset="1579133">But you haven't really answered Justice Alito's question as to why the later language is not surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.845" offset="1602748">If indeed it bears the technical meaning you say that it -- that it bears, that later language is surplus.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.833" offset="1630751">--It is not surplus if one reads comment k and understands what the drafters there were intending to get at, which was: If, based on current scientific knowledge, the risks are unavoidably unsafe, meaning there is no way in science we can design a safer product, there will be a defense to a claim of strict liability unless or provided that the product is properly manufactured and warned against.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.983" offset="1739316">This was a proviso that was intended to ensure that the focus be kept on the unavoidable, unsafe aspects of the design of the vaccine.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.689" offset="1786128">Now, the other side's view takes other words of 22(b)(1) and renders them surplusage.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.028" offset="1815489">And I am looking now at page 19A of our reply brief, where we set forth the statutory language, if you want to follow along here.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.883" offset="1846941">What the other side's view is that after the word 1, 1988 -- I am at page 19A of the reply brief, the addendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.524" offset="1893439">Under their view, all of the words that follow the word "if" and through "even though" becomes surplusage, because under their reading the manufacturer is relieved of all liability if, quote,</text>
