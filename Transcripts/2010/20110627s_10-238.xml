            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">I have the opinion of the Court in case 10-238, Arizona Free Enterprise versus Bennett and the consolidated case number 10-239, McComish versus Bennett.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.150" offset="149985">The Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Act created a public financing system to fund the campaigns of candidates for state office.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.824" offset="184675">Under that system, candidates who choose to take public financing are given a grant of state money to operate their campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.246" offset="218425">If such a publicly financed candidate faces a privately financed candidate, someone who has declined state money and is instead spending his own or raising money through contributions, the publicly finance candidate can get more state money.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.022" offset="281537">The State will give the publicly financed candidate roughly one additional dollar for each dollar above the grant amount that the privately financed candidate spends on election speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.760" offset="328453">Matching funds are also given to the publicly financed candidate, again on a dollar for dollar basis in response to spending on election speech by independent groups when that speech supports the privately financed candidate, or opposes the publicly financed candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.549" offset="399611">The question in this case is whether this system is permissible under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.660" offset="420091">Now the answer to that question largely follows from a case we decided just three years ago, Davis versus the Federal Election Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.660" offset="452065">In Davis, we invalidated a provision of federal law that permitted the opponent of a candidate who spent over a certain amount of his money to collect -- we permitted the publicly financed candidate to collect triple the normal contribution amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.371" offset="514863">While the candidate who spent the personal funds remains subject to the original contribution cap.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.698" offset="540254">We held that this unconstitutionally forced the candidate and "to choose between the First Amendment right to engage in unfettered political speech on the one hand and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations on the other".</text>
            <text syncTime="125.146" offset="605978">We ruled that this "unprecedented penalty" "imposed a substantial burden on the exercise of the First Amendment right to use personal funds for campaign speech."</text>
            <text syncTime="136.445" offset="651222">So in Davis, if you spent more than the said amount of your own money, your opponent could raise higher amounts in contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.836" offset="684763">We held that that violated the First Amendment because it inhibited the free speech rights of the candidate whose speech triggered the benefit to his opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.559" offset="727604">Now the burdens imposed on candidate speech by the Arizona matching funds are much more severe than the burdens imposed by the law we struck down in Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.371" offset="770863">The penalty in Davis consisted of raising the contribution limits for one candidate, but that candidate still had to go out and raise the additional funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.713" offset="808270">Here, the penalty for speaking is a direct and automatic payment of state money to your political opponent depending on the specifics of the election that issue, matching funds under the Arizona law can also create a multiplier effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.791" offset="876607">Arizona elections often keep a privately financed candidate against multiple publicly financed candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.819" offset="904714">In such a case, every publicly funded candidate receives the matching funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.762" offset="928434">In such a situation, the matching funds provision forces a privately funded candidate to fight a political hydra of sorts.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.020" offset="961452">Each dollar he spends generates two opposing dollars in response or even more.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.309" offset="986634">And unlike the law in Davis, all of these are to some extent out of the privately financed candidate's hands spending by independent groups triggers matching funds that go directly to the publicly funded candidate to use against the privately funded opponent even though that privately funded candidate had no control over the triggering funds in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.077" offset="1077750">That is a substantial advantage for the publicly funded candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.848" offset="1100842">Matching funds impose similar burdens on the independent expenditure groups themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.042" offset="1125606">The effect of a dollar spent on election speech by any such group is a direct payout to the publicly funded candidate the group opposes spending $1 can result in the flow of dollars to multiple candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.651" offset="1184016">And in some ways, the burdens imposed on independent groups are more severe than the burdens imposed on the privately financed candidates themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.152" offset="1218079">Independent groups of course cannot choose public financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.049" offset="1233648">As a result, those groups can only avoid triggering matching funds by changing their message or choosing not to speak at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.264" offset="1270429">Presenting independent expenditure groups with such a choice -- trigger matching funds, change your message, or do not speak is highly coercive in contrary to basic First Amendment values.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.443" offset="1327167">The candidates and independent groups that brought this suit contend that the purpose of the matching funds provision was to "level the playing field" to have all candidates in a political race the same financial resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.391" offset="1386935">But we have repeatedly held that leveling the playing field is not a legitimate Government objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.075" offset="1413684">As we said in Davis, "leveling electoral opportunities means the State making and implementing judge -- judges -- judgments about which strengths should be permitted to contribute to the outcome of an election."</text>
            <text syncTime="341.312" offset="1470631">For example, incumbents typically have an advantage in campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.968" offset="1489335">So how do you level the playing field to account for that?</text>
            <text syncTime="349.963" offset="1505322">Leveling the playing field financially may make it harder for outsiders to challenge incumbents, allowing states to make these types of judgments is a dangerous enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.212" offset="1554223">The First Amendment embodies our choice as a nation that, when it comes to protected political speech, the guiding principle is freedom as we have put it the "unfettered interchange of ideas" not whatever the State may view as fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.375" offset="1622873">The State disavows any interest in using matching funds to level the playing field even thought that is exactly how the system operates and even though the election commission website said that the Act was passed "to level the playing field" when it comes to running for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.897" offset="1692985">The State instead phrases the purpose of the law as being to combat corruption and argues that matching funds are necessary to attract candidates into participating in public financing so they can be sure they'll have enough money.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.646" offset="1752022">But this case is not about how much money the State can give the candidates that it funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.349" offset="1774801">It is about awarding extra funds in direct response to the political speech of an opposing candidate or an independent group.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.261" offset="1810432">The state says that matching the funds it gives out to the amount spent by privately financed candidates, plus independent groups, is not leveling the playing field.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.382" offset="1850974">But just an efficient way of calibrating how much is needed to make public financing attractive.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.695" offset="1876156">But we have clearly held over and over again that "the First Amendment does not permit the State to sacrifice speech for efficiency."</text>
            <text syncTime="454.688" offset="1924221">Here, the State makes its public financing system more attractive and less expensive to itself only by burdening the protected political speech of those candidates who elect to run for office without taking the states money.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.080" offset="1981691">Our decision in the Davis case makes clear that is not permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.923" offset="2005096">We do not today call into question the wisdom of public financing as a means of funding political candidacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.456" offset="2031219">That is not our business.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.047" offset="2041563">But determining whether laws governing campaign finance violate the First Amendment is very much our business.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.001" offset="2069462">The goal of creating a viable public financing scheme can only be pursued in a manner consistent with the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.070" offset="2101750">Arizona's program gives money to a candidate in direct response to the campaign speech of an opposing candidate or an independent group.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.320" offset="2142710">The State does this when the opposing candidate has chosen not to accept public financing in the exercise of his First Amendment rights and has engaged in political speech above a level set by the State again in the exercise of his First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.578" offset="2207702">This goes too far, Arizona's law substantially burdens political speech and does not sufficiently justified by a compelling interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.129" offset="2245945">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.960" offset="2261305">Justice Kagan has filed the dissenting opinion in which Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor have joined.</text>
