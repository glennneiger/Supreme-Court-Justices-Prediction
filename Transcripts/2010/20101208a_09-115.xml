            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="8.520" offset="139536">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.622" offset="147895">In 1986 Congress converted what had been before that time a merely peripheral concern of immigration policy, that is how to regulate worker authorization, and converted it into a core concern of immigration policy by the passage of the -- of the Immigration Reform and Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.099" offset="229815">This Court has characterized that change in legislation as providing a comprehensive scheme for dealing with those issues, and that characterization is obviously apt because Congress provided for an exhaustive and exclusively Federal method of bringing to the attention of Federal authorities, problems and worker authorization, the method by which those matters should be investigated, the method by which they should be adjudicated, all of which are controlled as a matter of Federal, exclusive Federal activity; and indeed the ultimate judicial review goes exclusively to the Federal courts of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.188" offset="378190">The sanctioning provisions are very explicit and they are very clear, and they are very balanced; and for a good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.926" offset="405149">Congress realized in this context that if you over-enforce in one direction, that is if you try to deter the hiring of unauthorized workers, you run a very serious risk of causing employers to err on the side of not hiring others who are in fact authorized but who may fall into protected classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.923" offset="481113">And so Congress very carefully calibrated the penalties on both sides so that the employer essentially would play it straight down the middle and hire the best people for the job under these circumstances, while of course complying if at all possible with the Federal requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.265" offset="542448">And so it's against that backdrop--</text>

            <text syncTime="125.958" offset="609217">Isn't -- isn't that what the State statutes here require?</text>

            <text syncTime="143.320" offset="678703">--Well, I think part of the problem is that there -- it is never 100 percent clear precisely who is and who is not an authorized worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.842" offset="712767">And I think what Congress said was -- I'm not going to deal with this problem in the kind of granular way you are looking at it, Justice Scalia, which is specifically at each of the individual employment decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.381" offset="754981">You are going to look at the generality of situations and realize that if you put on one side of the scale what Arizona has done here, which is to say that you can -- you can essentially have the death penalty to the business, that is complete eliminate the business's right to exist; and on the other side of the scale, a $250 fine, it would -- it would be pretty remarkable to say, well, I'm going to hide behind the intent and knowing requirements and instead simply avoid if at all possible the risk of Arizona's sanctions being imposed upon me.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.287" offset="894579">Well, I think what Arizona would answer to that is: Well, that's the only option the Federal Government left us.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="204.291" offset="922582">They excluded everything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.227" offset="926344">We might have used reticulated penalties or, you know, enforced the Federal law ourselves, but they forbade that.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.547" offset="959572">But they did allow us to enforce the law, immigration laws, through licensing, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="220.534" offset="987575">So it all essentially comes down to -- to the licensing issue, doesn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="225.521" offset="1007532">It does ultimately does come down to "through licensing" laws and -- the -- the -- part of the -- and the fundamental problem obviously with Arizona's scheme here is that this is not a licensing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.226" offset="1050373">This is a worker authorization sanctioning law.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="239.428" offset="1063121">When I picked up this -- this brief and looked at this case, I thought: Oh, well, licensing, that is a defined term; I will look in Corpus Juris Secundum or ALR or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.217" offset="1102305">But it really isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.100" offset="1109828">Your brief indicates you start with dictionaries, fair enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.854" offset="1128845">You indicate what Federal licensing laws are.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.656" offset="1140025">But I see no limitation on what the State can decide is a license in any jurisprudential principle that you cited.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="267.928" offset="1177119">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.378" offset="1178896">Justice Kennedy, I think the better way to try to -- to grapple with the meaning of the licensing law or whether it ought to be construed broadly to allow the State wide authority to engage in supplemental enforcement in this, or narrowly in order to say that what really ought to happen in this context is, if you deal with a situation where the Federal Government has enacted -- I'm sorry -- has enforced a provision and imposed a penalty through the Federal scheme, that then as a supplement to that the State does in fact have the authority to add something over and above what it -- what the Federal Government has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.851" offset="1320793">But it seems to me quite remarkable to think that Congress intended through a parenthetical referring to "through licensing laws" to allow the State to adopt an entire alternative shadow enforcement mechanism, non-administrative decision-making process, completely a State-run operation; and even at the end, the sanction is not -- is not imposed ultimately in effect by the -- by any regulating entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.752" offset="1428417">It is ordered by a State court.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="332.537" offset="1435523">That would be remarkable only because nobody would think that with this scheme in place, the Federal Government would not enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.774" offset="1460496">Of course no one would have expected that.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.208" offset="1470213">But what Arizona says has occurred here is that the scheme in place has not been enforced, and Arizona and other States are in serious trouble financially and for other reasons because of -- of unrestrained immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.118" offset="1525906">And therefore, they had to take this very massive -- I agree this step is massive, and one wouldn't have expected it to occur under this statute, but expectations change when the Federal Government has -- has simply not enforced the immigration restrictions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="371.929" stopTime="443.056">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="371.929" offset="1593093">Justice Scalia, I -- I understand the point and I understand the motivation for why Arizona did what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.066" offset="1613678">But the -- the problem is the statute was enacted in 1986 and that's when the preemption standards were put in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.553" offset="1639591">And the -- again, the notion -- if you look at the way the structure of the statute -- and this also responds in some ways to Justice Kennedy's question how should you read licensing, since it's not a self-defining concept -- is if you -- is that first Congress said very specifically that immigration laws should be enforced uniformly, which says that there shouldn't be 40,000 different localities offering up their view of licensing and -- and the additional 50 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.037" offset="1745544">Second of all, and this part I think is particularly telling in terms of this massive State scheme that's been adopted, which is that under section 1324a(b)(5) which is in 134a of the -- of the appendix, Congress specifically outlaws the use of the I-9 form.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.415" offset="1823075">And in some ways this goes to your question, Justice Scalia, because it would be inconceivable that the State can in fact enforce knowing and intentional decisionmaking without having access to the I-9 form, because that's--</text>

            <text syncTime="3175.564" offset="12807670">First, the farm labor contractor is simply an example, and I think it says such as an example of the type of licensing provisions that existed at this time that addressed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.254" offset="12846435">So that's not an all inclusive universe of the sanctions -- of the licensing laws that might be subject to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.258" offset="12878409">They also don't specifically say there has to be a prior Federal adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.979" offset="12893351">The sentence has passive voice, has been determined without specifying who is making that determination and it specifically refers to State and local processes that provide for the suspension and revocation of State licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.287" offset="12950612">And then there is a following sentence that says, you know, further, we don't intend to disrupt laws such as these forestry and other, you know, fitness to do business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.146" offset="13005991">We think this is a fitness to do business law, in that we are establishing as a State standard that if you engage in this conduct of knowingly employing unauthorized aliens we are going to have the ability to take an action against that license that we have given you to do business in our jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3286.287" offset="13250602">And I am -- there is that caution; it is good faith use of -- of the I-9 system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.691" offset="13272231">We do have examples where for example if an employer is terminated because they are unauthorized and they show up with a different name and different papers 2 weeks later, you are not going to be able to establish your good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.581" offset="13319774">So you are home free but subject to that good faith limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.116" offset="13333880">But we do incorporate the same obligations that exist under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.604" offset="13359794">And also, I wanted to address more on the farm labor contractors and the amendments and what we think that we are doing in those amendments was simply dividing responsibility at the Federal level between the Department of Labor and their processes that preexisted IRCA, and what they were establishing in IRCA, and said we are not going to have these determinations of whether they -- the farm labor contractor has employed an unauthorized alien through a Department of Labor process; we are going to instead use the IRCA-established process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.355" offset="13470866">But importantly what Congress did not change in the agricultural worker regulations was the provision that addresses State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.277" offset="13502527">It said before IRCA and after IRCA that those laws -- those Federal laws only supplement the authority of the States; and that means that they preserved all of the States' authority that they had before IRCA in the area of farm labor contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.005" offset="13577446">And that I think is reinforced by the legislative history that -- that again reinforces that those have been preserved through IRCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.445" offset="13611196">This is an area that has traditionally been within the mainstream of State police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.002" offset="13653410">We acknowledge that Congress does have the authority to preempt us, but they left important discretion in terms of our ability to impose sanctions through licensing and similar laws, and we are doing so by establishing this scheme that provides for the suspension and revocation of State licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.197" offset="13722164">It's an important part of the balance that Congress struck when it enacted IRCA by addressing what State authority would exist after that congressional enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.986" offset="13765319">We think the lower courts properly determined the scope of that provision and unless there are further questions, I thank you for your attention this morning.</text>

            <text syncTime="3431.264" offset="13830520">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and once again, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.435" offset="13859150">I want to begin frankly where Justice Sotomayor pointed me to before, which is the question of whether or not there really is a basis for allowing the States to independently investigate and to independently adjudicate these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.928" offset="13917142">And what is the evidence that Congress did not intend that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.980" offset="13929368">Justice Breyer quoted from the House report, recognizing not everybody accepts that; but it does seem to me to articulate a very commonsense limitation that says you have to have a Federal adjudication in the first instance and once you have got that then the State is allowed to add that sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.691" offset="14000212">That -- that principle it seems to me is reinforced by the limitation on what you can use the I-9 for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.012" offset="14025498">Justice Alito, you asked that question, but it does seem to me quite clear that what Congress envisioned in 1986 when it adopted this is you are going to have an exclusively Federal enforcement scheme including the adjudicatory process, and it is only in that context you are allowed to use the I-9, and the notion that the State could adopt a standard of intentional or knowingly, and not be able to have the I-9 materials available seems flatly at odds with each other, and therefore it cannot be that Congress intended under those circumstances to allow these matters to be adjudicated in that particular fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3523.024" offset="14197488">I -- it seems to me the easiest -- and of course, this has nothing to do with what Arizona does -- but the easiest is, if a -- an employer is convicted of -- of violating IRCA and a criminal sanction, and he happens to be a barber, and the State licensing law says if you are convicted of a -- of a Federal crime you will lose your license, it is available to the State under those circumstances -- and I think this is exactly what Congress had in mind -- to issue a notice to show cause why that particular person shouldn't have the license revoked and then go from there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3569.338" offset="14382749">I think you have to decide it on a basis of what Congress had in front of it in 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.640" offset="14399990">But remember, Congress was balancing three, at least, very difficult problems: minimizing problems on the employers, minimizing discrimination against people who are permitted to be hired, and avoiding hiring people who are not permitted to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.001" offset="14473446">And how you properly reconcile that is very difficult, but the one thing that seems to me clear is that that was a choice that Congress meant to leave to itself and to the Federal Government to sort out and not to give the States the opportunity to come in where they did.</text>
