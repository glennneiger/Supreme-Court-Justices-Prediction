            <text syncTime="32.054">It's -- it's a formal adversary proceeding in a very limited sense and not in the sense that caused us to require counsel to be provided in criminal proceedings where the other side is armed with the legal knowledge that the poor defendant does not have.</text>

            <text syncTime="65.997">Is it not true that many, perhaps most of these proceedings, do not have counsel on the other side?</text>
            <text syncTime="73.015">It is the wife who is trying to get -- a payment of -- of the -- of the defaulted alimony and does not have counsel--</text>

            <text syncTime="83.968">According to the government statistics, 70 percent of noncustodial parents either have no income or have income less than $10,000, and therefore in a State -- in every State that accepts TANF funds, which is every State, they are represented by the State agency, and South Carolina in this case has made a rule that in-State cases -- and that also includes nonwelfare cases where the -- a custodial parent has chosen to be represented by the State -- the State entirely carries its prosecutorial burden by filing a rule to show cause and an affidavit showing arrearages, and that places the burden, which South Carolina says is a heavy burden, on the defendant to prove inability to comply as a condition of maintaining his liberty.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.447">Now in this case Ms. Rogers was not represented by counsel at this proceeding, was she?</text>

            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="148.419">Ms. Rogers -- in most of the proceedings, and it -- it does vary from one to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.438">In all -- let's put it this way, all of the proceedings the charges and the State's prima facie case of willful contempt was established by a State employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.028">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.308">The State employee sends out the -- the will to show cause and proof that, evidence that the -- the noncustodial parent is in arrears on the child payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.140">So let's see what would happen if counsel is then appointed in one of these cases, where both the custodial parent and the noncustodial parent are indigent and perhaps not very well educated.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.677">Counsel is appointed for the noncustodial parent, and counsel comes in and says this is the income of my client, and he's hurt, he was hurt on the job, all his -- his income is Social Security disability benefits, and he doesn't have enough money to pay child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.445">Now, the custodial -- the non -- the custodial parent who has no attorney says he's not really hurt, I see him, I see him walking around, he's going hunting, he's shooting baskets, he's driving around in a new car.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.324">It may not be the -- the title may not be in his name, he's -- he's out on the street corner, he's buying drugs, he's drinking alcohol, but I don't have a lawyer and I can't prove any of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.247">So you've created a great imbalance there, haven't you?</text>

            <text syncTime="237.906">Not at all, Justice Alito.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.619">First of all, in all -- in the -- in the majority of cases the department of social services is in fact the real party in interest and the moving party, and in any private case, for a nominal fee the custodial mother can have the department of social services act in that role as Federal law requires the State to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.367">--Why don't you argue for a rule that -- that the State must provide counsel for the defendant in these cases where it has provided counsel or there is paid counsel on the other side?</text>
            <text syncTime="274.063">Wouldn't that be fair?</text>

            <text syncTime="281.293">The number of instances in which the State will be required to appoint counsel for the alleged civil contemnor will be in cases where -- I mean, there's no reason why the State of South Carolina when it issues the summons and the affidavit says fill out this form and let us know whether you have assets or have income; in all of those cases where they believe that this is a turnip, not a deadbeat dad, they will proceed with remedies other -- other than incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.051">It's only when they want to proceed in the face of a form that shows indigence and inability to have counsel, that the State has to provide a lawyer before it -- before it puts this man in jail.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="327.193">Mr. Waxman, in your opening statement you said whenever, in civil contempt, a person is subject to incarceration he or she is entitled to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.493">In your opening statement you didn't limit it to cases like the case we have before us; that is, where the defense is I'm unable to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.225">Therefore, I can't get out of jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.948">Are you limiting -- are you limiting your argument to the case of a noncustodial parent or a former husband who says I just haven't got the wherewithal to pay?</text>
            <text syncTime="373.790">Or are you making a broader claim that anytime someone is subject to incarceration they must have counsel?</text>

            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="383.280">It is definitely the broader claim; that is, this -- this decision about counsel has to be determined ex ante, because the State -- and this is our limit -- I suppose our more limited request for a categorical rule.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="404.261">Well, my -- my question follows from what I think Justice Ginsburg must have in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.483">My understanding is that it's a commonplace if the witness declines to testify even though the witness has immunity, or the attorney or the witness declines to produce a document, the judge says you will remain in jail until you comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.176">In most of the States I think he's allowed counsel; but does the broad statement that you -- or the broad argument that you responded, that you're making when you answered Justice Ginsburg's case, apply there, so we are in effect saying in all these cases you must have appointed counsel?</text>

            <text syncTime="492.534">In -- in a case where the grand jury witness refuses to testify, the cases all to my knowledge do require the appointment of counsel, because there may be a defense, and someone is being deprived of their liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.284">Now, I think it's important, Justice Ginsburg you asked me if I have a more limited rule, and in this instance the limited rule is that certainly counsel requires -- certainly the due process clause requires the appointment of counsel where the State places the affirmative burden on the contemnor to demonstrate as a matter of law and fact that he was unable to comply, and thus that incarceration would not be unlawful punishment, but lawful coercion; and that is, I think, an important distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="571.531">Why wouldn't the Solicitor General's solution of saying as long as a State tells a defendant that they have a burden of proof and some contours of what proof they need to supply or -- on that issue, that that would satisfy due process?</text>

            <text syncTime="981.727">There is no such case, but let me make two points about history and what the Due Process Clause means, notwithstanding what some of us might like it to mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.217">First of all, history -- the history is very, very complicated, and it doesn't dictate the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.366">The traditional distinction along the lines was not between civil or criminal contempt, but direct or indirect contempt, and as I know Your Honor knows because you've written it, traditionally at common law, I mean, counsel was provided for civil cases, and in misdemeanor cases, but not felony cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.679">The criminal civil distinction in contempt arose in this Court around the turn of the 20th century, and it arose so that the courts could exercise more supervisory review over the imposition of criminal contempt by courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.151">Now in Cooke and Oliver, this Court, as I said, long, long before it recognized that criminal contempt was a sixth -- a crime entitled to all Sixth Amendment protections, held that because of the nature of the deprivation of liberty, the appointment of counsel was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.465">And our submission here is as this Court has recognized, the distinction between civil and criminal contempt is the question of whether you have coercive imprisonment or imprisonment as punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.797">And in almost every case, the sentence involves some aspect of both, and where the only thing, the only thing that keeps the coercive imprisonment from being unconstitutionally punitive absent a jury trial right and proof beyond a reasonable doubt and counsel, is the ability to comply with the court's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.703">And that burden is put on the defendant, even though it is the State's burden to prove willfulness, due process -- fundamental fairness as due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1658.849">But then when you look at the procedures that you actually say would comply with due process, they are remarkably anemic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.109">Basically, you say that a form has to be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.598">You don't require that there be anybody attached to the court, the kind of person that Justice Powell might have been talking about in Vitek, some kind of caseworker to assist the person with whatever questions he might have about the form or about how to fill it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.257">You don't require that the court make any findings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1702.136">I think we would say that there are three fundamental requirements for due process in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.858">The first is both information regarding the nature of the inquiry that's going to be made at the hearing--</text>

            <text syncTime="1714.355">I'm not hearing you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1716.284">Certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.634">The first is -- as, Justice Sotomayor, you referenced earlier, the first is information in advance of the hearing that a critical question to be answered at the hearing is going to concern ability to pay, and a form or other type of procedure that would elicit information that's relevant to the alleged contemnor's financial condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.132">The second would be a hearing at which the alleged contemnor has the opportunity to respond to any further inquiries that may be triggered by information that's already been provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.455">This is, I think, a common feature of many systems outside of South Carolina which, by case law, have recognized that when a court has concerns that information on a financial affidavit might be misleading or inaccurate, they have a duty to inquire further and to require supporting documentation as necessary to confirm or dispel concerns about the accuracy of the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.148">And then finally, I think we would require an express finding that the -- the alleged contemnor has the ability to satisfy the purge conditions such that the person can be said, not only theoretically, but also realistically, to have the keys to the jail cell in their pocket.</text>

            <text syncTime="1784.044">Counsel, as I -- and then I think one of the deficiencies in addressing your argument is that I don't really know what the State's procedures are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.544">Your -- your co-counsel, Mr. Waxman, has said there was actually a form.</text>

            <text syncTime="1804.758">The only thing that does seem missing that the State clearly provides is a requirement that the judge explain what the basis of his contempt finding is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.878">I'm looking at 60A and 61A, and this judge left it completely blank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.313">So is this a due process violation facially, or is this a due process violation as applied, meaning it's just not clear to me whether south -- the State's process, in fact, has all of the elements that you're speaking about or how I make that judgment and whether the -- we didn't grant cert on the question of whether, as applied, there was a failure or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.581">I mean, one of the difficulties in this case is that there was really very -- no findings by the judge whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="1860.348">I think that's right, and I think it's also right that South Carolina, at least insofar as the record reveals, doesn't require a finding that the alleged contemnor has the ability to comply with a purge condition, as opposed to requiring a finding of willful violation of the court's order.</text>

            <text syncTime="2179.528">But I think in substance the form would look very much like the form that this Court sees on a regular basis attached to its petitions for writs of certiorari, and would also look very much like forms that are commonly applied in jurisdictions across the country in child support programs in order to establish the amounts of child support obligation in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.279">South Carolina employs such a form for that purpose, and I think it would be a relatively trivial matter for South Carolina to use a similar form for the purpose of enforcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2542.811">So picking up on your question to Mr. Waxman, Justice Kennedy, it's important to note not only that Petitioner's rule would reach other civil contempt beyond child support, but because any loss of liberty is the overwhelming factor in his calculus, it would apply to tens of thousands of immigration and extradition cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3829.761">Well, then, the appropriate thing is to answer the question that was raised by Petitioner in this case and not to go -- no need to go beyond that I would suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.075">Finally, let me point out that the closest analogue in the legal system to the question here about inability to pay child support is inability to afford counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.649">Our criminal justice legal system has extensive experience with that under the CJA, the Criminal Justice Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.630">In the Federal system and in most States, the burden is on the defendant to show his inability to pay counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3871.305">The statistics that I have seen show denial rates of 10 to 20 percent, in some counties as high as 35 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.870">So there is a meaningful inquiry and meaningful denials, and all of those cases would violate due process on Petitioner's logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.731">That cannot be the tidal wave to hit the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.590">That is not an appropriate extension of due process because the issues here and there are simpler, far simpler than in Lassiter, a formal trial-type adversarial procedure where nevertheless no categorical right to counsel was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.932">It's important to go back, if one looks at the roots of the right to counsel in Powell and Gideon and Zerpst, Powell talked about the need for the guiding hand of counsel who are skilled in the science of law in order to deal with technical defects in the charging instrument, to deal with incompetent irrelevant or inadmissible evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.162">In proceedings such as this, where there are no formal rules of pleading or evidence, there is not a need -- certainly not a need for a categorical right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.810">If there are no further questions, may I conclude?</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.819">Litigants can themselves argue the commonsense issue of ability to pay, just as they can address their ability to afford counsel without first having counsel, and the cost of appointing counsel across the board would deter States from enforcing custodial parents' and their children's rights, as it has in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.170">Thus this Court should dismiss for want of jurisdiction or else affirm.</text>

            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="3965.901">I have three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.280">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.410">First of all, I mean this -- the crux of this dispute comes down to whether this is some -- akin to some sort of simple form that can be filled out that any layperson, no matter how uneducated, can deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.583">Second, the question is how much of a burden is this going to be on the States?</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.502">And, third, the question of whether or not what counsel suggests as the Utah model or what he denigrates as the New Jersey model would be a way to square this circle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.722">First of all, counsel says he can't conceive of a legal issue that can arise in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.057">Let's just look at this case as an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.566">There was allegations of an admission of drug use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.638">Does or does that not constitute an inability to pay?</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.304">That is a legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.353">It is not a factual question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4018.316">Inability to comply is a legal defense, not a factual excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.037">The allegation was he's not employed, but maybe he's not looking for work or he's underemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.806">Is that inability to comply for purposes of a coercive contempt sanction?</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.166">Our suggestion is he could be incarcerated so that he could be placed on work release in a county jail program and reduce his arrearage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.824">Is that or is that not a permissible application of a coercive sanction of incarceration?</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.721">The cases that we've seen have said no, but it is an open legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4059.277">Even as to the marshaling of evidence, it is his burden not to just say, oh, I can't pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.675">He submitted a form that he filed for his disability payments that said I have no income and I have a car that's worth $1,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.665">Did he have to pay that car -- sell the car to pay or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.016">In terms of burden, the State is paying -- there are approximately 15 percent of the State's jail population in any given year that are noncustodial parents that are serving terms, in this case two 6-month terms and a year term, at the cost, according to the statistics, at the cost of between 13 and 17 thousand dollars a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.719">South Carolina, because it refuses to comply with the requirements of the Federal program, has already paid $72 million to the government in fines and owes another 10; and if you want to really reduce the cost, Justice Kennedy, and make this manageable, take the system that they are applauding in Utah or denigrating in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="4128.633">When the court sends out its order to show cause, it says please fill out this form showing whether you have income, whether you have assets, and whether you are unable to hire counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="4139.487">We don't have the Social Security disability form, but if the judge credited that and accepted that your client is -- was unable to work and had only the assets listed on that form, would he not then automatically be -- have shown that he had an inability to pay?</text>
