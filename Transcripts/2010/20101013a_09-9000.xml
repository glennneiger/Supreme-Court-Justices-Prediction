            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-9000, Skinner v. Switzer.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert C. Owen</label>
            <text syncTime="9.189" offset="142148">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.141" offset="153955">The issue before the Court today and the only question litigated to decision in the courts below is whether a prisoner's claim that seeks only access to evidence for DNA testing may be brought in Federal court under the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.865" offset="208917">The Fifth Circuit summarily answered that question "no" in hearings with longstanding view that any Federal claim that might conceivably set the stage for a subsequent collateral attack, however removed in time, must itself be brought via habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.625" offset="267954">That rule so clearly cannot be squared with the decisions of this Court, especially since Wilkinson v. Dotson, that the Court should reverse and remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.897" offset="300972">I would like to begin by describing the contours of the Heck rule.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="53.135" offset="318004">May I ask you about -- Wilkinson was parole, parole eligibility, so it didn't touch the conviction or the sentence, where this one does.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.542" offset="371608">So the cases are distinguishable on that basis.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_c_owen" startTime="69.810" stopTime="93.224">
            <label>Mr. Robert C. Owen</label>
            <text syncTime="69.810" offset="384669">Justice Ginsburg, the reason that we argue our case does not touch the conviction is that the relief that we are seeking, access to the evidence for testing, if we won, if we win in district court and we get that access, it does not necessarily imply -- which is the language this Court used in Heck and repeated in Dotson -- that the conviction is lawfully invalid.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="93.224" stopTime="121.641">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="93.224" offset="478292">I understand that argument, but there is the distinction of the type of case of where the -- the one, conviction and sentence were never going to be questioned, only parole eligibility, where here, the discovery that you seek in 1983 is not a destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.487" offset="571392">The destination is to further litigation that may or may not arise.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Robert C. Owen</label>
            <text syncTime="121.641" offset="591976">That's true, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.557" offset="595634">We -- we don't see that as a distinction that compels the conclusion that Dotson isn't the model to follow, because in -- in our view, what Dotson said -- again, the prisoners, as Justice Ginsburg says, were before the court seeking a declaration about parole procedures that Ohio planned to use in their cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.871" offset="672956">Those parole procedures had been adopted after those prisoners were sent to prison, and they complained that was an ex post facto violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.024" offset="697511">And Ohio argued, both in the Sixth Circuit and in this Court, that the fact that these prisoners expected at some point to come back to court armed with a judgment in their favor and seek a reduction in their sentences was enough to conclude that the case should be within the core of habeas.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="164.534" offset="763549">It does seem odd, though -- and I don't want to jump into your argument too much, because you have got planned out what you want to tell us -- it does seem odd that if your suit for DNA testing is not attack -- an attack on the sentence, that you asked for a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.607" offset="819869">I mean, if it's not an attack on the sentence, why shouldn't that factor into our decision not to grant a stay or to grant a stay?</text>
            <text syncTime="186.447" offset="851216">It's -- it's -- it's an irony in your position.</text>

            <text syncTime="190.232" offset="866367">I think it's an irony -- I -- I accept the Court's point that that -- that that seems unusual, but I think that the reason that the Court's cases, at least as to the relief that we're seeking and not the stay that the Court entered in order to hear this case and decide the question, that the relief we are seeking does not necessarily imply the legal and validity--</text>

            <text syncTime="213.597" offset="959781">We grant a stay because of the likelihood of success on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.232" offset="974305">And that goes to the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.684" offset="984127">And now you are telling us that your attack doesn't go on the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.120" offset="993949">I don't see why we don't just lift the stay, under your own view of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.205" offset="1010249">I think -- if I -- if I was understood to say that, then I -- let me clarify.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.242" offset="1026341">I think that our success -- when the -- when the Court applies the stay standard, it asks the question: What is the likelihood of success on the merits?</text>
            <text syncTime="241.098" offset="1069808">Success on the merits, for purposes of our lawsuit, means getting access to the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.537" offset="1107529">I don't -- I don't think so, Your Honor, because I think once we had demonstrated that we were likely to prevail on the merits of the case, I think the Court was within, you know, appropriate judgment to -- to make sure that the case didn't become moot by Mr. Skinner's execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.344" offset="1162804">Because I do think that the demonstration that we had to make was not about whether his ultimate -- whether, ultimately, he might get relief from his conviction, but whether we have a chance of prevailing on this civil rights claim that asks for access to the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="291.947" offset="1273250">The irreparable harm, if I remember, is quite obviously the execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.232" offset="1290386">But it's -- there is no irreparable harm from your failure to get access to the DNA evidence, unless its linked to the sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.229" offset="1374292">I think that if the Court finds that Mr. Skinner is going to die before he can litigate his claim and it finds he has a reasonable chance of prevailing on that claim, that is sufficient to -- to enter the stay.</text>

            <text syncTime="623.006" offset="2597449">The rule that we are asking the court to adopt for the whole nation has been the rule for some time in six different circuits and there is no evidence that in those circuits there have been a very large number of prisoners going into court under section 1983 and trying to leverage discovery under the circumstances that are suggested by Respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.153" offset="2674040">So that's the practical reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.188" offset="2682190">As a legal -- as a legal reason, I think that our claim turns on the existence of the liberty interest in the State statute for DNA testing that Texas has created, and that there is no statute in Texas for other kinds of general discovery; for example, access to the prosecutor's file, police reports, or other kinds of documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.816" offset="2756692">That's not -- there is no legal hook for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.935" offset="2765155">Our legal hook is the existence of that DNA testing statute and the existence under State law of opportunities to bring claims of actual innocence after the evidence is tested.</text>

            <text syncTime="2337.230" offset="9454383">So what Dotson says about Prieser is that the plaintiff there wanted the shortening of his term of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.519" offset="9491477">He wanted good time credits to be restored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.638" offset="9504016">And as we read it then, the shortening of the term of confinement is what made it proper in habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.910" offset="9533064">But we added that if it hadn't been for that, if it hadn't attacked the duration of the physical confinement, it wouldn't be habeas; it would be 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.951" offset="9577263">In Heck, the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.851" offset="9584786">They were establishing the basis for a damages claim that necessarily demonstrated the invalidity of the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.657" offset="9619999">Where that was so, there would be habeas.</text>
