            <text syncTime="10.939" offset="149149">Charles Martin never adequately explained why he waited more than 5 years to present additional claims to the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.829" offset="188750">As such, it was no surprise that these claims were rejected as untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.067" offset="213723">California employs a habeas corpus timeliness rule that merely requires reasonable diligence and disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.423" offset="247160">The rule is adequate under this Court's longstanding precedents in the Ninth Circuit's decision to the contrary should be reversed.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="43.927" offset="281119">What about the charge that, yes, we can agree with you that in general 5 years seems like a long time, but we have a brief from the Habeas Corpus Resource Center that says that in the 5 to 6-year delay category, 62 percent are dismissed on the merits, and that you can't tell; sometimes they do have merit, sometimes they do it as time-barred, and there is no rationale to when they do one or the other.</text>

            <label>Mr. Todd Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="78.666" offset="420091">Three brief responses, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.618" offset="427928">The first is that to measure summary denials, you can't tell from a summary denial ruling what the Court was thinking about the time of delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.558" offset="467634">The second point is that delay in California is only half the equation.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.145" offset="486024">In California there is a substantial delay and there is also the justification portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.764" offset="504519">So persons who operate under substantial delay still have an opportunity to justify that delay and gain the desired review.</text>

            <text syncTime="113.205" offset="558226">I thought there was something about, well, if the time question is more difficult, the merits are easy, there's no merit, so we just decide this--</text>

            <label>Mr. Todd Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="125.097" offset="605769">California's policy is to take a first look at a habeas petition and determine whether it has a prima facie case or whether procedural bars are apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.452" offset="643176">A court that is denying a case on the merits isn't necessarily saying the matter was timely, and courts should be permitted to reach whatever is the most judicially efficient method of resolving such a question without it being held against them.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="150.645" offset="707960">So basically you are taking the position or you are conceding that the California courts are not consistent in their application of the timeliness rule?</text>

            <text syncTime="172.410" offset="795105">The point that we are making is that when you look at a rule, whether you apply it or not -- or whether you impose it or not doesn't mean you are not applying the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.897" offset="824989">For example, when trial courts review matters under the Fourth Amendment, a decision not to exclude the evidence doesn't mean that they didn't apply the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.687" offset="864172">In this case if the trial court -- or if the reviewing court looks at the length of delay and then they may look at the justification to determine that the delay was justified.</text>

            <text syncTime="202.347" offset="914850">Well -- I might be speaking for her, but I thought that the Habeas Corpus Resource Center brief showed that the court, the California court, did reach some cases where an explanation had not been proffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.808" offset="992695">And so it can't be just a simple rule, that if you don't proffer an explanation you won't get heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.997" offset="1029371">So what's the next step in that?</text>

            <text syncTime="235.401" offset="1047030">The California Supreme Court, if the case is patently meritless -- and perhaps the procedural question of timeliness is more complex.</text>
