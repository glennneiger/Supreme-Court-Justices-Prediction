            <label>Mr. Roy T Englert Jr</label>
            <text syncTime="11.706" offset="152283">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.926" offset="165136">This case is a repeat of Quality King v. L'anza with only one pertinent difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.978" offset="185302">Both cases involve goods not authorized for importation into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.781" offset="204528">Both cases involve arguments that the first sale doctrine must be narrowly construed, thus the Copyright Act's importation ban, section 602(a), be given less than its supposedly intended scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.839" offset="252803">The only difference is place of manufacture of the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.141" offset="265968">Quality King involved U.S. manufactured goods; this case involves goods made in Switzerland.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.112" offset="285821">According to the Ninth Circuit in Omega, Congress intended to treat foreign manufactured goods better in this respect than goods made in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.235" offset="322393">It is wildly implausible that Congress had any such intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.853" offset="336812">From 1790 to 1891, foreigners were categorically ineligible to hold U.S. copyrights.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.942" offset="365234">From 1891 to 1986, the United States discriminated against foreign manufacturing of copyrighted goods through a series of so-called manufacturing clauses, including section 601 of the 1976 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.500" offset="419464">If Congress intended to make the first sale doctrine discriminate in favor of foreign manufacturing at the same time, one would expect some note to be taken of that fact in the legislative history, but none is.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.741" offset="468365">And yet the Ninth Circuit held that Congress in 1976 altered the long-established first sale doctrine to make it uniquely favorable to foreign manufacturing of copyrighted goods and did so through the obscure phrase, 109.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.500" offset="535448">No one in all the briefs in this case has identified a single reason why Congress would have wanted to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.856" offset="564809">Moreover, the words 109.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.128" offset="601903">Most instructive is the very next section after section 109, section 110, which governs educational use of copyrighted works and was enacted contemporaneously with 109.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.603" offset="647879">In describing the kinds of works teachers may show students in their classroom without fear of copyright liability, Congress referred to works lawfully made under this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.141" offset="689988">Our briefs have pointed out the absurdity of construing the phrase in section 110 to mean made in the United States, and it's very revealing how Respondent and its amici have tried to answer that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.116" offset="737844">Omega says "lawfully made under this title" means either made in the United States or authorized for distribution in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.741" offset="776401">That argument gives up any pretense--</text>

            <text syncTime="287.432" offset="1255173">So do you think that there is a difference between assigning a copyright to a foreign entity or merely licensing a foreign entity?</text>
            <text syncTime="297.906" offset="1297074">One of the criticisms of your approach is that you would draw a line between those two.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.428" offset="1331137">The line is -- depends on whether the copyright owner has given exclusive foreign rights to someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.432" offset="1363111">And the reason the exclusivity of the foreign rights matters is because that is the example given in the legislative history of 602 and in the paragraph in Quality King.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.140" offset="1401981">And to give meaning to section 602 and to be completely consistent with the rationale of the first sale doctrine, one must draw some line.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.060" offset="1433642">Drawing a line between the U.S. manufacturer and the foreign manufacturer makes no sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.393" offset="1550984">So -- so 109, though it doesn't say it, but if you look at the history and title, there has to be a transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.233" offset="1578360">So in fact, if a British publisher with a British right given by an American author or publisher makes this, 109 doesn't apply -- I mean, 109 doesn't apply until there's a sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.627" offset="1763934">It meant that in 1792, when I took Phil Arita's antitrust course, and he used to bring it up.</text>

            <text syncTime="1744.510" offset="7083510">And so when Costco says, for example, that Omega would have the right to exclude foreign-made copies that were produced by a transferee, but cannot do so if it manufactures the copy abroad itself, it really draws a distinction that has absolutely no basis in the text of the Copyright Act and that would make substantive rights, the value of the rights under 602(a)(1) and 106(3), turn on formalities and, again, transfers that really should make no difference in terms of the substantive rights that are available to the copyright owner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2313.887" offset="9360969">And when it did that, it added that language as a tag-on to that principle to ensure that it did not end up overruling legislatively Bobbs-Merrill.</text>

            <text syncTime="2347.875" offset="9496910">And that needs to then be read in harmony with section 602(a)(1), which after all, was part of the same act in 1976, it must be read in such a way as to give section rule 602(a)(1) sufficient room to perform the function that it was intended to perform, which is to ensure that a U.S. copyright owner could protect domestic distribution rights against competition from legitimate foreign copies.</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="2541.352" offset="10270866">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.554" offset="10279643">If the government's interpretation of section 109(a) is a little bit different from either of the parties, since I want to make clear precisely what it is, in our view, the words 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.914" offset="10341083">And because the Copyright Act doesn't apply abroad, in order for a copy to be made subject to Title 17, it would have to be created in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.270" offset="10382461">Now, I think our interpretation of the statute still gives it a slightly different meaning from the alternative</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.174" offset="10406076">"lawfully made in the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.258" offset="10414435">because at least in theory, it would be possible for the creation of a copy to entail a violation of environmental laws, workplace safety laws, minimum wage laws, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.016" offset="10457485">And it wouldn't be accurate to characterize a copy made in that way as lawfully made in the United States, but it would be made -- it would be lawfully made under this title, because it would be made subject to and in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.443" offset="10515163">Now, with respect to the types of copyright materials at issue here, the watches are clearly very different from what Congress had in mind when it enacted section 602(a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.882" offset="10556959">But in other respects, what Omega was trying to do in this case was exactly what Congress intended to allow when it expanded the importation provisions beyond restrictions on importation of radical copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.791" offset="10608577">The ideal was to allow a copyright owner to segment markets either to give -- either retain for itself or to give to another entity exclusive rights within the United States, but give other rights abroad to other producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.449" offset="10663225">And consequently, we argued in Quality King and we are arguing here that the Court should construe section 109(a) in a way that doesn't prevent section 602(a) from performing that function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.657" offset="10708052">And the Court in Quality King grappled with the question of whether applying the -- section 109(a) to the labels that were at issue in that case would have the effect of negating 602(a)(1) and the Court said no it wouldn't, because section 109(a) applies only to copies that are lawfully made under this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.570" offset="10787673">And the Court specially said it wouldn't apply to copies that were made -- lawfully made under the law of the foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.807" offset="10812646">Now, the Court didn't refer specifically to the place of manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.676" offset="10828110">In giving the example of the British publisher who would be creating copies under the law of Great Britain, it didn't specifically say that's because British law would apply when the copies are made in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.234" offset="10874399">But I think that's the necessary inference, because the Court's analysis made quite clear that it viewed a particular copy as being lawfully made under the law of one and only one question--</text>

            <text syncTime="2716.282" offset="10970530">--Well, I think there are -- I think we would say a couple of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.884" offset="10980979">The question has been raised whether this gives favored status to a foreign manufactured goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.871" offset="11004907">And in one sense our reading -- from -- from the perspective of the copyright owner, it's true, that this creates something of potential incentive to manufacture abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.644" offset="11040016">Now, from the perspective of the potential importer, you could say this makes foreign manufactured goods disfavored because they were harder to get into the country than would be the case if they had been manufactured within the United States and had then been sent abroad and -- and reimported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.486" offset="11099366">I guess the best we can say about the treatment from the copyright owners' prospective, the differential treatment of foreign and domestic manufactured goods is that at least with respect to goods that were made within the United States, the copyright owner has exercised rights under United States law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.829" offset="11168747">He has -- it has exercised its exclusive right to produce the copies in the first instance, whereas the manufacturer in Omega's position by creating and then selling the watches abroad, never exercised any of its Title 17 rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.189" offset="11222141">And the theory underlying the first sale doctrine tracing it back to -- to Bobbs-Merrill, the first articulation by this Court of the -- the doctrine of the copyright context, the theory is that a copyright owner who sells the goods, places them in the stream of commerce, has exercised, as the Court put it in Bobbs-Merrill, its exclusive right to vend, and therefore it can claim no more rights under the copyright laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.204" offset="11318272">Omega with respect to the watches at issue here, never exercised any its rights under title 17, not -- not when the watches were made and not when they were sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.744" offset="11352440">I do also want to address the question of what happens in the circumstance where Omega manufactures watches abroad, but then voluntarily imports them into the United States, sells them here; can it place restrictions on resale because I think it's an important policy question and here again we get to the same point in the end as the Respondents do, but we have a somewhat different textual route to get there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.609" offset="11451810">Our view is that in that circumstance section 109(a) still would not apply, because even though the goods were imported into the United States, they were made abroad, and that's what counts for determining whether they were lawfully made under this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.452" offset="11507190">But section 109(a) is simply a safe harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.321" offset="11518683">It doesn't prohibit anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.006" offset="11525475">Section 109(a) says if your conduct falls within these contours then what you are doing is legal, whether or not it would otherwise violate the copyright act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.544" offset="11563614">But if there is a dispute as to whether section 109(a) applies, and a court held that it doesn't, the consequence is not necessarily that the conduct is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.067" offset="11597678">The consequence is that you look to other provisions of title 17 to see whether it is lawful or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2915.627" offset="11767892">I think we would still be looking to other provisions of the Copyright Act rather than to common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.829" offset="11784714">That is, in the hypothetical I describe, clearly there could be no violation of 602(a)(1), because the copies would have been imported by Omega itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.101" offset="11817838">And so the question is if Omega sells them within the United States and the buyer attempts to resell them, would that be an infringement of Omega 17's rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.076" offset="11857753">And the only claim that Omega could -- I mean that -- Omega could plausibly make in that circumstance would be to say, that is a violation of my exclusive right to distribute copies to the public protected by section 106(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.550" offset="11911670">And I think the response would be under Bobbs-Merrill, the Court already held that once the copyright owner exercised its exclusive right to vend -- the word which appeared at the statute at the time -- once it had exercised its exclusive right to vend the copies, it was done with them and had no more rights to assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.428" offset="11983141">And there is no reason to give the right to vend -- the right to distribute under the current law a broader reading than the right to vend had at that time, simply because Congress has enacted section 109.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.003" offset="12033400">And -- so I think that the -- it would still be the case that in order to prevail in a copyright suit, Omega would have to show that not only that section 109 was inapplicable, but there was a violation of the exclusive rights and I don't think it would be able to do that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.864" offset="12096825">Now in Bobbs-Merrill, the Court was certainly drawing on common law principles but it said in the end, its words:</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.684" offset="12124202">"This is exclusively a question of statutory interpretation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.236" offset="12138412">It -- it based its holding on the language of the Copyright Act as it existed at that time, specifically the exclusive right to vend; and the exclusive right to distribute copies to the public is no different for these purposes under the current statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3028.566" offset="12219705">And they trace this back to Professor Nimmer's 1965 letter, and they say that the point there was that they were reading Bobbs-Merrill as it was a pre-emption question, that they thought that the copyright law was not pre-empting State law of contract, and State law of contract had the exception in it which applied the first sale doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="3056.367" offset="12330883">We could look up what the State law is, but my guess is that the first sale doctrine applies just as much to goods that come from abroad as to goods that are here at home.</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.841" offset="12368812">I -- I think with -- with respect to the pre-emption question, what they had in mind was a situation in which Omega sells the watch to a reseller -- to a retailer on condition, for instance, that the retailer only sell them in a particular way, or do particular types of advertising, and the reseller sells them in violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3100.846" offset="12508829">I think the language was chosen in part at least to make clear that although Omega under in that hypothetical circumstance would have no remedy under the Copyright Act, it might potentially have a breach of contract suit against the retailer if the retailer had breached the agreement with Omega, and that nothing was -- in the Federal law was intended to preempt the State law contractual remedies that would otherwise be available.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roy T Englert Jr</label>
            <text syncTime="3154.732" offset="12724391">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.284" offset="12738602">Justice Ginsberg asked Mr. Panner what policy Congress could have had in mind to give this different status to foreign-made goods than to U.S. made goods, and Mr. Panner's answer, and Mr. Stewart said something similar, was that in one respect Congress is disfavoring foreign goods under their interpretation by making them harder to import.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.514" offset="12827523">That's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.550" offset="12831598">Under both of their theories, as long as the manufacturer chooses to authorize importation, which is Omega's test, or as long as an authorized first sale takes place in the United States, then the first sale doctrine does apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.957" offset="12889276">So the copyright holder has control under their theory and it's not harder to import the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.527" offset="12911532">In the briefs in this case you will not find anyone making any policy argument as to what Congress could have had in mind to favor foreign-manufactured goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.735" offset="12952388">The heart of Mr. Panner's argument was that Costco's position either eliminates any significant role for section 602(a)(1) or makes section 602(a)(1) turn on formalities of transfer of title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.946" offset="13021247">Neither of those propositions is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.112" offset="13029919">This Court in Quality King addressed the role that section 602(a)(1) has to play if section 109 is applicable to imported goods, and the answer was it still applies to nonowners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.122" offset="13081955">That was the Court's first answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.422" offset="13087075">The dictum that has been much discussed this morning was another answer but the Court's first answer was that it still applies to nonowners, and because, for example, software is licensed there is a very live issue about whether the first sale doctrine applies to lawfully acquired copies of -- of software.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.898" offset="13149038">So 602(a)(1) has a role to play under anyone's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.850" offset="13160845">Now Mr. Panner asserts that our answers to some of the questions that the Court has asked in our efforts to harmonize our position with the dictum in Quality King make 602(a)(1) turn on formalities of transfer of title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.091" offset="13217792">Our position can perhaps be criticized and has been criticized this morning not for having a textual basis, but it cannot be criticized for making anything turn on formalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.466" offset="13255304">Our position turns on the economic realities of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.918" offset="13269096">If the copyright owner gets its one reward, the first sale doctrine applies; if the copyright owner doesn't get its run reward, because for example it has given the exclusive foreign manufacturing rights to someone else, and retained or assigned or licensed the exclusive U.S. manufacturing rights, then 602(a)(1) has a role to play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.645" offset="13347986">So neither of Mr. Panner's criticisms of our position is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.331" offset="13358749">Mr. Panner asserted that section 109(a) differs from section 27, the predecessor statute in the 1947 Act, which in turn was Section 41 of the 1909 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.972" offset="13405351">This Court said the exact opposite in Quality King.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.107" offset="13417890">It said there is no evidence of any attempt to narrow the first sale doctrine through the language of section 109(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.494" offset="13443385">And if one looks at the House report -- again, getting into legislative history, which some members of the Court do not like to get into -- but if one looks at the House report, the first sentence of the relevant part of the House report is section 109(a) restates and confirms the principle that where the copyright owner has transferred ownership of a particular copy or phonorecord of a work, the person to whom the copy or phonorecord is transferred is entitled to dispose of it by sale, rental or other means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.114" offset="13561877">No hint that using "lawfully made" under this title to narrow the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.851" offset="13576819">The last sentence of the relevant part of the House report: To come within the scope of section 109(a) a copy or phonorecord must have been lawfully made under this title though not necessarily with the copyright owner's authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.908" offset="13629064">For example, any resale of an illegally pirated phonorecord would be an infringement, but the disposition of a phonorecord legally made under the compulsory licensing provisions of section 115, would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.699" offset="13672218">So what does the House report on section 109 tell us?</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.485" offset="13687369">It tells us that lawfully made under this title was intended to expand the category of covered works beyond just those made by the copyright owner, or with the authorization of the copyright owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.959" offset="13733240">But under Omega's and the government's position, that phrase is used to contract the scope of the first sale doctrine in derogation of the common law, imposing a restraint on alienation for foreign-made goods that is not imposed on U.S. made goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.068" offset="13789665">With respect to the policy incentives that it creates it's undeniable that it creates an incentive for outsourcing of manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.324" offset="13822683">The government admitted that in its cert stage brief, and again, in its brief in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.828" offset="13848701">Obviously if Congress wants to create an incentive for outsourcing, that's probably within its power as long as it can be said somehow to advance science and the useful arts; but there is simply not a shred of evidence in text or legislative history that Congress intended to encourage outsourcing; quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.040" offset="13925606">The very controversial section 601, the adjacent section to section 602, required that nondramatic literary works in the English language be manufactured in the United States or Canada or else they would not be eligible for a U.S. copyright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.984" offset="13993315">So we know that the 1976 Congress wanted to favor the domestic printing industry, not to disfavor it; and yet their interpretation of 602 and 109 would disfavor domestic printing industry and any domestic manufacturing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.744" offset="14052352">Thank you.</text>
