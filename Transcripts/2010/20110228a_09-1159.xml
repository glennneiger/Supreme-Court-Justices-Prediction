            <text syncTime="11.172" offset="150089">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.908" offset="161061">The Bayh-Dole Act sets forth a comprehensive disposition of rights in inventions made by nonprofit organizations and small business organizations under Federal funding agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.696" offset="204215">That disposition specifically defines the rights of inventors and it puts them in the third position behind the contractor, the nonprofit contractor, and behind the government, and specifically says that the inventor may only receive rights -- that is to say, take title -- when the -- when the contractor has declined to take title or defaulted in some respect, and the government itself has -- has likewise declined to take title.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.831" offset="312780">In this case Roche's sole claim rests on an assignment from an inventor who was at that time I think without question a Stanford employee who was working on a project under a Federal funding agreement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="84.052" offset="441616">Well, Your Honor, the act deals specifically with independent contractors, and -- the regulations at least do.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.908" offset="469096">And they indicate that the -- that the contractor in that instance, if in fact working on a Federally funded project, would step into the shoes of the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.114" offset="509848">But I don't believe it would affect the outcome in terms of whether it would be a Bayh-Dole invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.768" offset="536492">The -- the critical fact here is that the inventor was working on a project that was already funded, his work at Cetus was part of that project.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.189" offset="574213">And then that result was--</text>

            <text syncTime="117.908" offset="577034">That seems to be a factual dispute, so maybe you can be clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.962" offset="609217">According to Cetus or Roche, at the time that this scientist came to Cetus to work, there was no Federal funding; that that Federal funding for this project, the Stanford project, came about after the scientist had spent his 9 months at Cetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.845" offset="700750">At least that's the picture that -- that they draw, that the Federal -- that they got their assignment from the scientist at a time when there was no Federally funded project.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.635" offset="747980">--That's what they say, Your Honor, and I would submit that is plainly not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.706" offset="764280">We deal with this at pages 21 and 22 of our yellow brief, and we specifically talk about the fact -- there's several critical facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.193" offset="794164">One is that the article which was written about the work at Cetus, the JID article at page 135 of the joint appendix, specifically has a footnote indicating that the work reported on -- that is the work at Cetus on the assay -- was funded by the two specific grants in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.905" offset="865008">Dr. Merigan, who is the head of the lab at Stanford that Dr. Holodniy worked in, talks in his declaration at 98 and 99 of the joint appendix -- specifically talks about how Dr. Holodniy's work was part of the AIDS research center at Stanford and part of an AIDS clinical trial at Stanford, and all of that work was federally funded.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="238.587" offset="1059777">Well, I think you have to look very carefully at the facts, and I don't want to speak loosely and categorically about the facts, but what -- what I will say is that in a situation where -- and this is very clearly true -- in a situation where prior work is done by persons who are, to start with a clearer set of facts, not affiliated with the university, and they -- let's say that person conceives of an invention, and that later the university takes that conception of an invention and reduces it to practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.142" offset="1193942">The conception by a person who is not a university employee, if -- if there's no university person involved in the conception, then it can't be an invention of the contractor, because you can't be an inventor without being part of the conception.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.168" offset="1258099">So that's a variation on Your Honor's -- on Your Honor's question, but it's a -- it's a clear example where Bayh-Dole would not apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="296.024" offset="1289550">--How does that change when you -- when you alter the hypothetical so that he was already an employee of Stanford, but was not working as an employee of Stanford when he was at this other company?</text>
            <text syncTime="308.732" offset="1340332">You could still say that -- that Stanford was not the inventor.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.469" offset="1355274">Well, you would -- you -- I think you are now in a zone where one of the things that has to be considered is the equitable character of any assignment of a future interest, that is to say a future invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.360" offset="1410863">Because if in fact what was assigned was, as here, the possibility that there might at some future time be an invention, then equitable considerations come into play; and one of the equitable considerations we think the one that is of paramount significance, is the fact that the Congress of the United States has said in the context of Bayh-Dole that when the United States invests money in research, it wants certain things to happen that are very carefully set out in the -- in the Bayh-Dole Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="377.009" offset="1613469">If -- if B is a bona fide to purchaser under 35 U.S.C. 261, then B would prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.601" offset="1651816">If B is not a bona fide purchaser, and that can only apply under 261, where you are dealing with an assignment in law of a patent or a patent application, then I think you are in the difficult zone where there are two competing interests in the future possibility of an invention; and I don't know that I can, without knowing all the facts, even intelligently try to tell you what would end up happening.</text>

            <text syncTime="438.949" offset="1861214">--Well, I think that is at the heart of -- of our -- of our core argument and of the government's argument, and it is that, as the trial court here held, and as we've said in our brief several times, the inventor, because he is working here at the time of the assignment on a Federally funded project as an employee of Stanford University, is essentially working on something covered by Bayh-Dole; and being covered by Bayh-Dole means that he lacks the power to transfer title to this future invention to someone else because the statute has already spoken for it.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="476.259" offset="2010425">Mr. Ayer, it seems the Federal Circuit emphasized a distinction between the scientist saying "I will assign", which was the language used in the agreement with Stanford, and "I hereby do assign", and it seems that that was critical to the -- to the Federal Circuit's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.588" offset="2099764">They say -- they cite a whole bunch of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.124" offset="2109900">The suggestion seems to be that if Stanford had said "I hereby do assign", there would be no case because Stanford would have been first in time.</text>

            <text syncTime="512.532" offset="2155562">Well, one interesting thing about that discussion is that the very first case that we know anything about, that we're aware of, making that distinction and relying upon the immediate effect of an assignment using the words 1991.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.559" offset="2223689">That was 2 years after the events in this case, so how was Stanford supposed to know that that fine distinction was going to be made?</text>
            <text syncTime="537.047" offset="2253573">We think the critical -- the critical issue here is whether the inventor, while working on a federally funded project as an employee of the contractor -- and there's no doubt that his work at Cetus was part of his Stanford research.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.509" offset="2319506">All you have to do is look at pages 16a to 18a of the petition appendix for the court of appeals decision or pages 62a and 69a for the district court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.499" offset="2371438">It's perfectly clear that everyone knew he came to Cetus to advance his work on his Stanford research, which was in fact funded, as we show at pages 21 and 22.</text>

            <text syncTime="644.413" offset="2683026">But those policies I think are very clearly in virtually every case I know anything about policies that are signed by an employee pretty much the day they walk in the door, as I think was the case here with Dr. Holodniy back in 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.054" offset="2737674">And it's a general understanding of what the expectations are, and I don't want to here be heard to say at all that we think this is an unwise thing or that it isn't a good thing that it goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.112" offset="2777903">It's a very good thing that it goes on, because people need to understand what the situation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.731" offset="2796293">The critical issue is whether, in the event that that fails to happen for some reason or that there is a slip-up here where a fellow going to visit somewhere on the first day there has something put under his nose called a visitor's confidentiality agreement which he happens to sign, and down in paragraph 2 it talks about assigning away everything that he ever might do as a consequence of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.327" offset="2882706">The point is that in that situation you can't have the interest of the United States, which is the critical paramount interest in this case -- I want to make that very clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="806.150" offset="3330027">And I want to just say at the outset, the critical thing about narrowing the universe of inventions covered is that it narrows the universe of inventions in which the government's rights to, number one, itself receive title under several provisions of the act; number two, itself to enforce a whole series of requirements under 202(c)(4), (5), (6), (7) and a variety of other provisions, to itself march in and do things.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.801" offset="3432636">When you define out of that category instances where inventions exist and were produced with Federal money, then you're limiting the coverage of the government's interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="881.882" offset="3632943">And the second is that you are relying on a provision that says that the nonprofit organization may elect to retain title, which means hold onto a title, that the -- the organization already has.</text>

            <text syncTime="1601.952" offset="6513204">That is, it's standard university practice to say employees agree to assign their inventions to the university, and the two parties will divide the royalties; and if that is done, then even under Respondent's view it becomes a subject invention; and the university's commercialization of the invention is subject to all the requirements of Bayh-Dole.</text>

            <text syncTime="1677.066" offset="6813717">But to continue my answer to Justice Kagan, I wanted to point out, under Respondent's theory, universities could make a conscious, calculated decision that, rather than obtain an assignment for their inventors, they would simply agree with the inventor that royalties would be split in -- in the same manner as previously, but that the inventor would retain title and, perhaps with the assistance of the university's technology transfer office, would negotiate with commercial entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.149" offset="6930014">And the effect would be to contract around Bayh-Dole; commercialization could occur without complying with any of the prerequisites.</text>

            <text syncTime="3411.854" offset="13752884">There was a thousand dollars, ten dollars, one dollar -- we don't know -- of Federal funding under an agreement that has never been produced, that is of indeterminate scope, and they suggest, simply by averring in a patent application, that this is all of a sudden a Bayh-Dole invention, even though it was -- indisputably now, under the findings of the District Court, conceived before Dr. Holodniy left Cetus and subject to this agreement, and it was done at a time when Dr. Holodniy was being paid not by a Bayh-Dole-related grant, but by a National Research Service Award, which the Bayh-Dole expressly exempts from its provisions in section 212.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.027" offset="13893528">So the notion that Cetus somehow has lost the private right to the invention conceived using its proprietary materials and information simply by the subsequent use of an unknown amount of Federal funds, that that works as a divestiture--</text>

            <text syncTime="3481.115" offset="14029887">It is open on any remand.</text>

            <text syncTime="3485.985" offset="14049322">But to answer the question, here's the record on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.521" offset="14059457">The salary was not paid by NIH grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.139" offset="14070011">It was paid by a National Research Service Award that is exempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.008" offset="14081400">The grants were never produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.525" offset="14087565">The grant titles, on their face, do not apply to the work that was done at Stanford.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.078" offset="14105746">One of them deals with establishing a center for AIDS research.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.946" offset="14117240">Of course, this is work that was not done at the Stanford Center; it was done at Cetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.482" offset="14131346">The second one deals with AIDS clinical trials, and it's undisputed that there were no clinical trials at Cetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.886" offset="14152976">The clinical trials only happened when Dr. Holodniy went back to Stanford.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.754" offset="14168440">Dr. Merigan's declaration, which Mr. Ayer referenced on JA 98, says only that Dr. Holodniy's research at the lab at Stanford was covered by Bayh-Dole Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.710" offset="14204280">It says nothing about the work at Cetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.094" offset="14209818">And if there was any doubt, Stanford argued repeatedly to the Federal Circuit that the federally funded research started in 1990, and this issue was decided on summary judgment against Roche when all factual inferences should have taken in our favor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="3541.571" offset="14271676">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.671" offset="14276065">The -- I think the place to start here is with the fact that Congress, faced with a history under which the Federal government had taken ownership outright of federally funded inventions in approximately 80 percent of the cases, enacted a statute to change that because the government wasn't any good at getting the stuff developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.771" offset="14372509">And so they -- they defined the coverage in terms of -- to cover these two phrases, inventions of the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.960" offset="14401243">There is no question, if you look at section 200 on 1A of the blue brief, you will see in the middle of this initial policy and objective section a reference to what they thought they were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.819" offset="14460698">At the very bottom of that page, on the bottom line, they talk about ensuring that inventions made by nonprofit organizations and small business organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.075" offset="14501763">That's the universe they wanted to cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.627" offset="14515973">The same words -- "inventions made by those organizations" -- are in the heading of the regulations, and they appear elsewhere throughout the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.983" offset="14549305">So they meant to cover the universe of inventions that those institutions create.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.887" offset="14568950">We talked earlier about the word "retain".</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.571" offset="14579712">The word 202(d), mean that whoever is retaining it must have owned it before they started, because it's a hundred percent clear, just from thinking about the statute and from reading page 38 of the red brief, that when an inventor is allowed to be considered for retention of title, he never has ownership of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.473" offset="14683261">And so the word "retain" can't mean that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.123" offset="14689949">What does the word "retain" mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.758" offset="14696427">I would submit the word "retain" means what it often means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.960" offset="14709279">It means that sometimes in a situation, someone is allowed to continue holding something subject to conditions that may change, and perhaps in spite of realities that make you think that's surprising.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.017" offset="14761524">For example, a parent may be allowed to retain custody after a disputed custody hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.706" offset="14792244">That's a temporary thing, perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.406" offset="14799036">The court may allow it to change.</text>
