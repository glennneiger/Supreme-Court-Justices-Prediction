            <text syncTime="14.492" offset="163359">This case asks when a district attorney's office may be liable under section 1983 for inadequately training prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.705" offset="196274">The Petitioner, Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office, was found liable for the terrible injuries caused to Mr. Thompson by a Brady violation on the theory the office was deliberately indifferent to Brady training, this despite the fact that there was proved no pattern of previous misconduct by office prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.995" offset="273387">The district court exempted this case from the ordinary pattern requirement by making a flawed analogy to a hypothetical in this Court's City of Canton opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.146" offset="314034">There, the Court suggested that a city may be liable, absent a pattern, if it fails to inform police officers of the basic constitutional standard for deadly force.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.361" offset="358860">Extending that hypothetical to this case was error.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.627" offset="375892">It misunderstood Canton's distinction between a single incident and pattern liability, nullifying Canton's stringent standards of fault and causation.</text>

            <text syncTime="79.669" offset="424061">Because in Canton, the hypothetical was one rookie police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.804" offset="456662">Here, it wasn't one rogue prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.707" offset="480277">There were four prosecutors who knew of this blood evidence and there were multiple opportunities for them to disclose it, but four of them apparently thought it was okay under Brady to keep this quiet.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.460" offset="571288">Now, if we were just talking about -- what was his name, Deegan?</text>
            <text syncTime="119.787" offset="584558">it would be a different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.584" offset="591768">But we have the three other prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.192" offset="606187">So I think it's questionable to characterize this as a single incident.</text>

            <text syncTime="138.001" offset="657387">Our argument does not turn on whether it was one or three or four prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.137" offset="677972">What our argument does turn on is that the theory from the Canton hypothetical, which does not require a pattern, was clearly at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.353" offset="714856">The district court analogized to Canton in order to allow the jury to find liability absent a pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.086" offset="741815">There is no question that, whether it was one or four prosecutors, this is a single incident of a Brady violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.190" offset="774207">Counsel, this is a single incident, and Canton said if you know that a tort is likely to happen without training then one incident is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.245" offset="834393">Every prosecutor knows that there can be Brady violations if people are not taught what Brady means, because it's not self-evident in every situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.665" offset="884130">Correct?</text>

            <label>Mr. S. Kyle Duncan</label>

            <text syncTime="197.394" offset="894997">So if you know that rookie prosecutors -- and most prosecutors' offices are filled with young ADA's who have just come out of law school.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.452" offset="943271">If you know that they are going to meet some situations where the answer is not intuitively known, like that if you get a lab report, you should turn it over, don't you have an obligation, isn't that what the jury said, to train them to turn over lab reports?</text>
            <text syncTime="230.505" offset="1027490">Now, I know you claim you had that policy.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="241.592" offset="1071794">That's a sufficiency of the evidence question.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.514" offset="1079526">But if you know that lab reports have to be turned over, you've conceded it's a Brady violation not to do it, and there was sufficient -- and you had no policy -- I know you are disputing that -- and you had no policy of turning it over, why aren't you responsible for a Canton-like violation?</text>

            <label>Mr. S. Kyle Duncan</label>
            <text syncTime="267.989" offset="1177328">The question is under the Brady scenario, which side of the Canton line does it fall on?</text>
            <text syncTime="273.579" offset="1199689">Does it fall on the single incident line or the pattern line?</text>
            <text syncTime="276.219" offset="1210347">We say it falls on the pattern line.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.890" offset="1221005">But life doesn't always come in just two categories, and my suggestion to you is this doesn't fit into this single rookie.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.152" offset="1257994">You have -- if you have four prosecutors who are not turning over this evidence, then it seems like to me it's kind of a culture in the office that we don't turn over -- either we don't understand Brady, because one suggestion was -- well, having the blood sample will show you -- you would have to have the blood sample from Thompson to have it mean anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.263" offset="1390488">So there was misunderstanding about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.340" offset="1410759">But what struck me was that to shoehorn this into a single incident, it doesn't fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.838" offset="1452763">So we have a situation maybe that hasn't -- that we haven't directly confronted before.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.974" offset="1481289">Well, I think the Court has in Canton, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.052" offset="1489648">Let me answer it this way: If we pay close attention to the function of the single incident hypothetical in Canton, I think it illuminates the kind of notice, the kind of fault, and the kind of causation that needs to arise out of a general situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.389" offset="1542938">So looking carefully, what Canton said is: A policymaker who fails to give police officers the basic constitutional standard for deadly force, which they are not equipped to know in the beginning, and without which--</text>

            <text syncTime="377.127" offset="1613887">This is -- this is -- I am referring to the -- the basic Canton standard is at 390, page 390 of the Canton opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.936" offset="1641159">And specifically, the footnote is footnote 10, that discusses the two possibilities, the no-pattern and the pattern possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.088" offset="1677730">So I'm reading from Canton at footnote 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.101" offset="1693821">City policymakers know -- "For example", the Court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="400.492" offset="1707405">"city policymakers know to a moral certainty that their police officers will be required to arrest fleeing felons. "</text>
            <text syncTime="405.160" offset="1726109">"The city has armed its officers with firearms, in part to allow them to accomplish this task. "</text>
            <text syncTime="410.175" offset="1746171">"Thus, the need to train officers in the constitutional limitations on the use of deadly force can be said to be so obvious that the failure to do so is deliberate indifference. "</text>
            <text syncTime="419.125" offset="1781906">Now, what we have there, as Justice O'Connor's concurrence in that case and then later the Court's opinion in Bryan County explains, you have a failure to inform city personnel of the basic standard without which they have no hope of doing their job in a constitutional manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.367" offset="1842928">So you put your employees in a situation of impossibility and when a deadly force violation occurs, what you have--</text>

            <text syncTime="1188.523" offset="4859549">But the problem with Brady -- and this case illustrates it so well -- is you don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.160" offset="4886089">If the prosecutors don't do what they're supposed to do, there is a very high risk, as there was in this case, that it will never come to light.</text>

            <text syncTime="1227.023" offset="5013462">But the question you pose, Justice Ginsburg, is whether the latency, the hiddenness, that characterizes Brady violations should change where we locate the Canton violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.318" offset="5054736">Should it be enough to put it into the single incident, so-obvious category, or still in the pattern category?</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.609" offset="5083888">But Canton doesn't indicate that the latency of a particular violation should -- should turn on which category it goes into.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.093" offset="5113772">Instead, it's the nature of the employee duties and the employees themselves and how that situation gives notice to a policymaker about when there are obvious training risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.102" offset="5157867">That's what we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.899" offset="5164972">So to go back to the hypothetical, in Canton whether or not a deadly force situation is secret or not -- of course it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.581" offset="5203738">But the office has failed not just to train, but to inform of the basic constitutional duty, without which those officers have no chance of fulfilling their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.062" offset="5257655">And when they do a deadly force violation under those circumstances, the causal link will be very strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.543" offset="5283568">It will be strong enough to meet Canton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.278" offset="5290569">And so there you have -- there you have a situation where deliberate indifference and causation are met without the pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.916" offset="5317110">But what -- you do not have that in the situation of Brady compliance because, as -- as everyone agrees Brady involves gray areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.819" offset="5348665">It is impossible to determine beforehand exactly why a Brady violation will occur, and what specific training measures would prevent it from occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.030" offset="5393492">And what that means is, this falls plainly within what Canton said about the pattern situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.593" offset="5419823">Here's what Canton said in the footnote 10 following onto the hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.887" offset="5436959">"It could also be that the police in exercising their discretion so often violate constitutional rights that the need for further training must have been plainly obvious. "</text>
