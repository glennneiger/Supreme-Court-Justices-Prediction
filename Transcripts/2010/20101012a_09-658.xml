            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">We will hear argument next this morning in Case 09-658, Premo v. Moore.</text>

            <label>Mr. John R. Kroger</label>
            <text syncTime="14.117" offset="161896">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.993" offset="177361">The court of appeals held that Arizona v. Fulminante was the clearly established Federal law to control and govern the outcome of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.501" offset="219470">This was an error, because this Court has never applied Fulminante's direct appeal harmless error standard, which places the burden of proof on the government, to a collateral ineffective assistance of counsel claim, where the burden of proof is on the inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.088" offset="289792">In Boyer, unlike Fulminante, there is no trial transcript to review because the defendant pleaded no contest or guilty before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.475" offset="327304">The court of appeals' decision conflicts with both Strickland v. Washington and Hill v. Lockhart and will have grave negative consequences for our criminal justice system.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="65.286" stopTime="89.541">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="65.286" offset="366592">But isn't -- isn't Fulminante relevant as -- just for the proposition that a defendant's own confession carries heavy weight, leaving the rest of it -- the statement that -- in Fulminante that when a defendant confesses to the crime, that carries heavy weight?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="89.541" stopTime="128.742">
            <label>Mr. John R. Kroger</label>
            <text syncTime="89.541" offset="463559">Yes, Your Honor, I think it's relevant to that extent, that a confession from a defendant is significant evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.223" offset="494279">However, it certainly does not imply, as the court of appeals proceeded to do here, that it controls the prejudice prong of Strickland, that it sets a new standard of review of harmlessness, that it shifts the burden of proof onto the government, or that it limits the prejudice analysis to that question of the potential impact of the confession at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.715" offset="584244">And so for all those reasons, I -- I think the -- the court of appeals has gone well beyond any potential relevance of the Fulminante decision.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="128.742" stopTime="161.573">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="128.742" offset="620398">Is it -- if I am understanding your argument, it is that the Court erred in assuming that if the confession had been suppressed -- which you're not arguing for or against.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.018" offset="681524">I'm assuming you are not taking your amicus's position that we have to get to the question of what would have happened in a motion to suppress -- but that under all circumstances, if there's a suppressible confession, a defendant should never plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.388" offset="735023">You are saying that that conclusion is what the Ninth Circuit drew and that was wrong?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="161.573" stopTime="180.364">
            <label>Mr. John R. Kroger</label>
            <text syncTime="161.573" offset="751741">Your Honor, we're -- we are suggesting that the court was wrong both in stating Fulminante provided the standard of review, as well as holding that you can, in effect, assume prejudice simply because defense counsel failed to file a motion which defense counsel believed was not--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="180.364" stopTime="186.564">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="180.364" offset="826870">So it's another way of saying what I said, which is, no defendant should plead guilty if it's a suppressible confession?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="186.564" stopTime="188.171">
            <label>Mr. John R. Kroger</label>
            <text syncTime="186.564" offset="851634">--That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.767" offset="852470">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="188.171" stopTime="201.838">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="188.171" offset="858112">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.670" offset="860097">So now, what is the other information that would have made a plain guilty in this case inevitable?</text>
            <text syncTime="197.873" offset="896878">However, that's a higher standard than you need to meet, but--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="201.838" stopTime="249.909">
            <label>Mr. John R. Kroger</label>
            <text syncTime="201.838" offset="912760">As -- as Your Honor noted, that is a much higher standard than we have to meet under Hill v. Lockhart.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.710" offset="940241">There were very good reasons why defense counsel's advice to this defendant plead guilty was sound and reasonable advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.157" offset="974096">First of all, the defendant faced a very strong government case, even at that stage of the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.747" offset="1000427">Second, there was a potential charge of aggravated murder that could be brought if the case were taken to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.179" offset="1030102">Third, the plea offer that was extended to the defendant and which the defendant took was very favorable to the defendant, both in terms of -- of capping the amount of time that the defendant would serve, as well as dismissing two additional mandatory minimum charges of assault and kidnapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.954" offset="1101260">So--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="249.909" stopTime="254.701">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="249.909" offset="1105021">--Were those higher than the minimum he pled to?</text>
            <text syncTime="252.452" offset="1115261">Were those mandatory minimums higher?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="254.701" stopTime="457.024">
            <label>Mr. John R. Kroger</label>
            <text syncTime="254.701" offset="1124248">--No, Your Honor, but they could have been run consecutive rather than concurrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.434" offset="1147131">I -- I think more significant is the fact that when the defendant himself testified about the reasons he pled guilty, none of the reasons he provided had anything to do with the strength of the government's case or the failure of counsel to file the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.585" offset="1211810">What the defendant said motivated his guilty plea was a concern about an aggravated murder charge, a desire not to have to testify against his brother, which he believed would be the outcome of a guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.719" offset="1264264">And those factors were in the defendant's mind when he decided to take the guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.935" offset="1289132">So in this case, even if one were to shift the burden onto the government -- and I do not believe that -- that that is consistent with Strickland -- the government would prevail here.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.948" offset="1333227">This case raises, I think, significant consequences for application of Strickland and Hill v. Lockhart.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.489" offset="1371366">Strickland and Hill clearly place the burden of proof in a collateral proceeding on the inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.722" offset="1400310">The court of appeals here shifted the burden of proof, pursuant to Fulminante, onto the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.455" offset="1423193">One can see this in the petition appendix at page 48 where the court states that there is not enough evidence in the record to prove that the defendant would have pled guilty had the confession been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.215" offset="1482230">As I stated to Justice Sotomayor, I believe the government actually could meet that burden, but that is certainly not the burden that either Strickland or -- or Hill requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.163" offset="1530086">Second, the Court's application of Fulminante transforms the Hill v. Lockhart analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.922" offset="1561119">It narrows it to one degree, because it's focused on one issue, what the government's evidence would be at trial, rather than looking at the broad array of issues which might motivate a defendant to plead guilty which the courts will look at under -- under Hill v. Lockhart.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.529" offset="1623500">For example, under Hill v. Lockhart the court will not only look at the defendant's testimony with respect to the estimate of the strength of the government's case, but also look at the potential for an additional sentence that is higher or additional charges that carry a higher sentence if the defendant proceeds with litigation rather than pleading guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.270" offset="1706465">It will look at the investigation risk that additional evidence would be found in, if the case continued rather than terminating in an early plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.623" offset="1739901">And it will look at personal factors as the ones that were evident in this case that might motivate a guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.496" offset="1771353">For those reasons, the Hill v. Lockhart standard encompasses a broader array of factors in determining whether there is prejudice than a simple application of Fulminante's direct appeal post-trial standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.599" offset="1823807">It is also the case that the application of Fulminante will substantially increase the amount of speculation which courts have to engage in compared with applying the proper Hill v. Lockhart test.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.342" offset="1882739">Hill v. Lockhart limits the amount of speculation by focusing on the defendant's motive in pleading guilty and whether the ineffective assistance could have influenced that decision to plead guilty.</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="457.024" stopTime="489.105">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="457.024" offset="1933521">What about Judge Berzon's test, that seems to be simple and a matter of common sense, that if you get rid of the confession, then you have a better chance of getting a good deal in the plea bargain?</text>
            <text syncTime="473.143" offset="1997991">The confession certainly -- it -- this serves the defendant to get rid of that as well as weight on the prosecution's side.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_r_kroger" startTime="489.105" stopTime="572.084">
            <label>Mr. John R. Kroger</label>
            <text syncTime="489.105" offset="2061834">Your Honor, I would say two things: First, the test which is proposed by Judge Berzon in the concurrence has never been recognized or promulgated by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.492" offset="2107392">So in a collateral proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S. Code 2254, it would not be clearly established law that the State court was required to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.301" offset="2150651">And second, application of that standard, as Judge Bybee noted in his concurrence, would require an immense amount of speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.390" offset="2187013">In this case, the majority in the Ninth Circuit hypothesized that filing the motion to suppress the confession would strengthen the defendant's position in negotiation vis-a-vis the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.821" offset="2240721">It is also very possible, however, that the Government would respond to filing a motion as opposed to taking an early offer of guilty plea by taking the case to the grand jury, seeking an aggravated murder charge, and thus, putting the defendant in a worse position in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.439" offset="2311147">And, in fact, as Judge Bybee noted, he questioned whether the courts have the proper tools to be able to speculate years after the guilty plea whether a particular motion may have increased or may have decreased the amount of leverage that a defendant has, or what kind of response that that motion might have drawn from the prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="585.982" offset="2449387">It's prejudicial if in the absence of that he would have gone to trial or wouldn't have pleaded guilty, or -- and what's the alternative to trying to figure out whether that's so?</text>

            <text syncTime="753.306" offset="3118644">Even at this early stage in the proceeding, the police had uncovered certainly the body with the direct shot to the temple.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.321" offset="3150723">It had recovered the -- the murder weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.785" offset="3160545">It had recovered the car which the defendants had borrowed and which had blood in the trunk where the victim had been locked and transported.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.095" offset="3193772">They had four witnesses who were present when the plan to kidnap and assault the victim was hatched.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.826" offset="3228776">So they would have testified very directly about the forming of the plot.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.858" offset="3244868">There was an eyewitness who identified the defendant, Mr. Moore, at the trailer where the victim was abducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.088" offset="3281753">And then, of course, there was a co-conspirator, Mr. Salyer, who was cooperating with the Government prior to the confession and whose -- whose cooperation was known to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.737" offset="3336401">So, with all of those pieces, even if one stripped the three confessions out of the case, you would still have a situation where the Government 's case was strong, where there was a very severe risk the Government would go to the grand jury and obtain an aggravated murder charge, and where there was significant advantages to pleading early and locking in a lower sentence to a felony murder charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="885.313" offset="3646631">I think the -- the prejudice argument here is extraordinarily strong, but I think the deficient performance, even if one concedes that the motion would have been meritorious, the deficient performance prong is strong as well, because the defendant can't meet his burden of proof that defense counsel's representation was unreasonable, given the strength of the government's case, given the quality of the plea offer that was made, and given the defendant's own reasoning for why he pled guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.489" offset="3775363">The case has significant practical consequences for the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.001" offset="3809426">One is that if the Ninth Circuit's opinion stands, it will be much easier to challenge guilty pleas years after the fact on collateral challenge, and this will undercut the principle of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.559" offset="3863656">One would certainly expect to see fewer Government plea offers in cases like this, if the Government believed years later it would have to present all of its trial evidence in a collateral proceeding in order to rebut the presumption under Fulminante that there was prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.879" offset="3936904">Second, it has severe implications for the freedom of defense counsel to exercise its discretion and represent its client using the wide latitude that Strickland recognized was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.466" offset="3999284">Strickland itself stated that it's a mistake to hem in defense counsel with strict rules about what should or should not be done, because defense counsel needs that wide latitude.</text>

            <text syncTime="1135.884" offset="4649002">And so it is very unlikely that the other two co-conspirators would have found themselves charged with an intentional murder based on the facts of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1226.330" offset="5010745">First of all, the State court's decision, even if it were incorrect in its ruling that the confession would not have been admissible, the State court's conclusion that the motion would not have assisted the Defendant in any way, the finding that it would have been fruitless because of the other confessions, the other two confessions in the case, is a reasonable decision that the Court made and is dispositive and thus under AEDPA should receive deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.523" offset="5131536">I would also suggest the case is somewhat similar to Yarborough v. Alvarado.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.286" offset="5158599">There was a custody issue at stake and this Court explicitly held that one might come out one way or the other on the custody issue, that reasonable jurists might split, but that that fact alone rendered the State court's opinion on voluntariness or on custody in that issue as reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.525" offset="5243549">And again, as here, though we are not asserting that this confession was admissible, should the Court consider it, it's clearly a close question on voluntariness and somewhat factually similar to Yarborough where even if the State court were was wrong, it was still a reasonable adjudication of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.643" offset="5324006">If there were no further questions from the Court, Your Honor, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1360.570" offset="5547719">Why is it unreasonable for the defense attorney to have concluded that the evidence showing your client's presence at the shooting, and identification as the shooter, that it was solely that he should have gone to trial on a defense that he wasn't involved in the shooting at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.746" offset="5628385">Once you put him in this shooting, then the only issue he seems to be confused about is that he thinks that because it was accidental that that presents a defense to felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.430" offset="5683137">And that's clearly an erroneous position on his part.</text>
