            <text syncTime="3161.946" offset="12752206">What's your best answer to why this is just not identical to escape, which is a fleeing-from situation just as this is.</text>

            <text syncTime="3171.587" offset="12790763">Justice Sotomayor, the basic distinction is that the person who's charged with escape, assuming that escape means escape from a secure institution or from a person, is that the person is in custody, and it takes, in the ordinary case, aggression and violence to get out of the custody of that person.</text>

            <text syncTime="3293.097" offset="13276745">Of course the ordinary case or the typical case, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the Court needs to look at the conduct encompassed by the elements of the statute, and so we would have to look at exactly what the statute requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.791" offset="13339544">The circuit courts have been very divided on escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.528" offset="13354486">In my circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Federal statute, 751, has been held not to be -- which is a general escape statute -- not to be a violent felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.485" offset="13402342">But, again, the Court talks about the ordinary case in the James case for the purpose of disabusing the idea that one can't get out from under the violent felony designation just by coming up with a hypothetical case or an example where it can be done without -- without violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.149" offset="13488964">Here, I would suggest that counsel has just created for the Court some kind of a hypothetical case to define the typical or ordinary case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.338" offset="13521774">This Court has never done that, and this Court said in James that it's important to stick to the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, because if we start factoring in other kinds of conduct, as several of the things which have been mentioned by counsel for the government, that begins to raise Apprendi problems, which is another whole issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.339" offset="13629712">But the Court said in James, and I would acknowledge is the law, that so long as the determination as to whether there's a serious potential risk of physical injury is made by focusing on the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, then there's not an Apprendi problem.</text>
