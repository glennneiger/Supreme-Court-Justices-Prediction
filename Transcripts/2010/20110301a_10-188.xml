            <text syncTime="13.991" offset="162398">The question in this case is whether a FOIA response is a report or investigation within the meaning of the False Claims Act public disclosure bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.180" offset="199178">Our position that it is allows the Court to reach the critical question whether a relator has contributed genuinely valuable information.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.554" offset="236690">The position taken by Mr. Kirk and the Government would disallow the public disclosure bar before reaching that critical issue, and it would therefore lead to a host of lawsuits by relators with no meaningful information to contribute, and that is precisely the result that the public -- the public disclosure bar is intended to prohibit.</text>

            <text syncTime="85.103" offset="446819">--Justice Ginsburg, that may well be a legitimate use of a FOIA request, and the question then becomes whether the information disclosed in the FOIA response reveals the allegations and transactions upon which the qui tam suit is based.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.400" offset="520067">But that question, that use by a relator of the FOIA process, doesn't go to whether or not a FOIA response is itself a report or investigation within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.922" offset="562176">A relator can still escape the public disclosure bar if the relator can demonstrate that his complaint is not based upon the allegations and transactions that are disclosed in the FOIA response.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.099" offset="618809">So in each case, we'd have to tell what was the -- the false claims claim; was it so heavily dependent on FOIA disclosures, or was the FOIA disclosures -- say they were a minimal part of the--</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven Alan Reiss</label>
            <text syncTime="151.464" offset="712328">Precisely, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.981" offset="718388">In fact, what a court should do is precisely what the district court did in this very case in a very thorough opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.820" offset="749735">Judge Stein went through every element required for the public disclosure bar to be invoked, including whether the FOIA response was a report or investigation, including whether Mr. Kirk's complaint was based on allegations and transactions disclosed in that FOIA response, and concluded that every prong of the disclosure -- public disclosure bar was met, and, therefore, the public disclosure bar prevented Mr. Kirk's claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.887" offset="854016">And that is precisely the analysis that we contend ought to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.672" offset="869167">Under the Government's position and Mr. Kirk's position, you never get to the critical inquiries about whether the allegations in a relator's complaint were publicly disclosed in a report or investigation, because under their view, a FOIA response itself is rarely going to qualify as a -- as an administrative report or as an administrative investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.323" offset="971776">We think that view is plainly incorrect under the ordinary uses of the words "report or investigation", a position that was obviously found to be the case by the First, Fifth, and Third Circuits.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.333" offset="1027783">--If I -- if I submitted, as we -- all Federal judges do, financial disclosure statements to an administrative office, and then someone from the press has a Freedom of Information Act request to see that financial disclosure statement, does it then become -- does it become the report of the administrative office, rather than my report to the administrative office?</text>

            <text syncTime="262.285" offset="1155574">Well, Justice Ginsburg, that's an interesting question, and whether -- and some lower courts have held that if the Federal -- if the -- if the report -- even though the report is filled out by a nongovernmental person, such as yourself in this instance, it might still qualify as an administrative report because the information being sought is dictated by a Federal administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.551" offset="1244599">Now, we don't think you have to reach that position for -- for Schindler to prevail here, because the one thing that is clear is that a FOIA response by the Department of Labor is itself an administrative report or investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.657" offset="1389108">That's a far cry from what we have here, but that's a much closer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.109" offset="1402901">But with respect to FOIA responses, the third way in which information is disclosed by an agency under FOIA, it is always in response to a specific FOIA request.</text>

            <text syncTime="1907.055" offset="7734669">There's such a strong government purpose in getting these documents out to the public, and specifically in this case to relators and whistleblowers that this Court has held, 15 -- has held, almost 15 years ago, that that is why Congress amended the statute in 1986, and to tell the Congress now 25 years later that they made a mistake when they used the word FOIA to cover everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.824" offset="7857758">But instead, Congress chose a very narrow set of enumerated sources, specifically so that other documents would be available to relators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.430" offset="7892135">As I tried to say before, getting those FOIA documents out to a relator is particularly important, because it has the correspondence between Schindler or other contractor and the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2713.636" offset="10961000">Justice Ginsburg, in response to your request, the new version of the False Claims Act lets the government disclaim the public disclosure bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.278" offset="11003528">It now says the bar can apply unless opposed by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.396" offset="11016067">So the government has an automatic ability to stop the imposition of the public disclosure bar simply by opposing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.717" offset="11041353">So that is a material change in the government's favor that the new False Claims Act has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.954" offset="11062251">Let me just address an underlying premise that we've heard, I think, somewhat repeatedly from the Government and Mr. Kirk, and that is this notion that FOIA is simply an automatic process, that agencies are a publishing house or clearinghouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.928" offset="11118153">That notion is utterly belied by the statute and the process itself, and it's utterly belied by the statistics from the Department of Labor in terms of what their responses are and how they do them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.271" offset="11171547">In 2008, which was the last year we were able to find statistics for, the Department of Labor, the department at issue here, processed 17,000 FOIA responses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.644" offset="11213030">Only 28 percent were granted in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.631" offset="11232987">Thirty-two percent were denied in full, 10 percent, based on the statutory exemptions, and 22 percent based on other statutes like the Privacy Act, and 40 percent of those 17,000 responses were partial responses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.592" offset="11304772">So we can give you some but not all; and in fact the FOIA responses in this very case not only reported that we found some of the VETS-100 reports in some years, we didn't find them in others; but with respect to the VETS-100 reports that were attached, they actually made redactions, because those redactions were compelled according to the Chief of Compliance and Investigations by the Privacy Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3039.930" offset="12266183">--Exactly, Justice Sotomayor, but our position does not resurrect the government knowledge standard that Congress changed in 1986, and it doesn't do so for some very good reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.553" offset="12312680">First of all, the government -- the government knowledge standard that the Court -- that the Congress changed in 1986 didn't allow a relator who is actually the original source of the information to bring suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.945" offset="12362209">That was one of the major things that prompted the congressional change in 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.349" offset="12379867">Secondly, and it's clear from the legislative history in the Senate report, one of the primary concerns of Congress in enacting the statute in 1986 was the fact that there was a sense that government employees themselves who were knowledgeable about potential contracting fraud were not coming forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.160" offset="12451129">In fact, the Senate report cites a 1983 survey in which 73 percent of 5,000 government employees responded they would not come forward with evidence of contractor fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.534" offset="12496583">That was a major concern with Congress under the old government knowledge standard, the pre-1986 government knowledge standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.438" offset="12524168">Those -- if those employees came forward, the suit would still be barred because the government by definition would have known about the fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.878" offset="12557918">Under the new statute, not only do you have the original source exception, but if government employees come forward, they are not barred from bringing those qui tam suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.166" offset="12599087">It's a major change and it's not the resurrection, Justice Sotomayor, of the government knowledge standard.</text>
