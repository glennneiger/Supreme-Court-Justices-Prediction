            <text syncTime="13.391" offset="157947">The North Carolina Court of Appeals asserted jurisdiction over Petitioners in this case on claims that arose from a bus accident in France that was unrelated to any North Carolina contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.781" offset="207475">Although the Petitioners are located overseas and do not conduct any business in North Carolina, the court held that North Carolina had general jurisdiction over these defendants based solely on the sale in North Carolina of a small fraction of their products.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.910" offset="272050">Under this Court's cases, the mere sale of a defendant's products in a State does not permit the State to reach out to assert judicial power over all of that defendant's worldwide conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.301" offset="321578">If that were permissible, every significant seller of products would be subject to suit everywhere on any claim arising anywhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="91.724" offset="471312">They also have other business that the parent does conduct in North Carolina, but there's no objection to jurisdiction over the parent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.698" offset="515197">This case solely concerns the Petitioners, who are corporations from Turkey, France and Luxembourg.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="112.303" offset="553650">Do you think there is general jurisdiction over the parent?</text>
            <text syncTime="115.672" offset="567129">If the consent were not in the picture, is there?</text>
            <text syncTime="118.124" offset="576846">Does general jurisdiction go beyond State of incorporation, principal place of business?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="meir_feder" startTime="123.695" stopTime="257.531">
            <label>Mr. Meir Feder</label>
            <text syncTime="123.695" offset="599207">I think that that is a hard question.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.515" offset="618433">Your Honor, the short answer is I think the answer is no, but I think that that is probably a close case, again putting aside the consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.989" offset="668379">But I do think that general jurisdiction is about suing a company -- at least in the case of corporations, is about suing the corporation essentially where it's located or at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.713" offset="723237">It's always fair to bring a suit against the corporation there.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.284" offset="741522">I think that once you get beyond that, which is a situation that would be analogous to a State's power over a citizen or a resident of the State, I think you run into great difficulty finding a basis for the State to assert authority over claims completely unrelated to any business that -- or any contacts that the corporation has with the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.816" offset="839638">That said, it wasn't contested here, and there is a consent to service of process, which may or may not create general jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.873" offset="883837">There's a disagreement in the lower courts on that, but none of that is contested in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.325" offset="901705">And without having to get to that particular question of whether in fact it's limited to -- whether general jurisdiction is limited to place of incorporation or principal place of business, first of all, there's much more directly controlling authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.489" offset="974326">In this case, the most directly relevant cases are Helicopteros and Consolidated Textile v. Gregory, working in tandem.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.012" offset="1012464">In Helicopteros, which was this Court's last corporate general jurisdiction case, the Court said that there was no general jurisdiction based on $4 million in purchases in the State and some other contacts; and the key is that -- on that point, is that the Court held that mere purchases could not provide the basis for general jurisdiction because the pre-International Shoe Decision in Rosenberg was controlling on that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.531" offset="1134508">Again, this is preliminary and it just goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.485" offset="1154361">I assume that there is general jurisdiction over the parent company.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.387" offset="1169930">Then under respondeat superior, it would be liable in North Carolina for the -- all the acts of its agents?</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="275.159" offset="1205039">Well, then why isn't it automatically liable for all the acts of its subsidiaries?</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="280.979" offset="1228340">And does that get -- and does that get into what in the Federal practice would be necessary parties?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="meir_feder" startTime="287.050" stopTime="371.037">
            <label>Mr. Meir Feder</label>
            <text syncTime="287.050" offset="1252582">--What -- Your Honor, I think that really what it gets into is the difference between a subsidiary and an agent, because a subsidiary is not automatically acting as the agent of the parent company in a way where you would get respondeat superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.560" offset="1314649">And I think that part of what is going on in this case is that when this does go back to North Carolina for trial or for litigation against the parent company, I think that under North Carolina or whatever State's or nation's vail piercing or agency standards the North Carolina courts will apply, the plaintiffs will have great difficulty actually with the substantive case against the parent company, because you would actually have to show involvement in the actions that actually the claim arose out of here.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.483" offset="1466368">The mere general control that's inherent in the parent/subsidiary relationship is not going to create liability, and here -- important to remember -- we're talking about a tire manufactured in Turkey, accident in France, which Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company -- and now this is outside the record, as I understand it -- did not have any direct connection with.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.182" offset="1557170">Again not relevant to the jurisdictional question here, but I -- just for sort of setting the context.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="371.037" offset="1588517">You are met with an argument that it's all one ball of wax, parent and sub, they merge, it's one enterprise; and so if the subs do something anyplace, the parent is -- it's all part of one thing, so I think that was the principal argument made by Respondents.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="meir_feder" startTime="397.355" stopTime="434.861">
            <label>Mr. Meir Feder</label>
            <text syncTime="397.355" offset="1693842">Yes, Your Honor, and I would say, again when it comes to liability and Goodyear Tire and Rubber, they will be free to make that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.043" offset="1732608">That argument is not properly presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.495" offset="1746401">It was never made below.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.781" offset="1755491">It was never -- it was not made in the brief in opposition to cert, so any argument for ignoring corporate distinctions or an enterprise theory, none of that was made, and therefore has been waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.839" offset="1811707">I think that, secondly, as we indicated in our reply brief--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="434.861" offset="1843890">We haven't resolved a whole lot if we leave that question open, have we?</text>
            <text syncTime="437.980" offset="1856324">You want us to write an opinion that says: Unless you -- unless you ignore the separate corporate existence of the subsidiary -- parenthesis, a question on which we expressed no opinion, close parenthesis -- there can be no jurisdiction in cases like this?</text>
            <text syncTime="461.428" offset="1950156">Is that the kind of an opinion that the world is waiting for?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="meir_feder" startTime="463.797" stopTime="529.489">
            <label>Mr. Meir Feder</label>
            <text syncTime="463.797" offset="1959560">--Well, Your Honor, I think that actually in -- if the Court were to write that, it would be left with the important general jurisdiction question that the court below decided incorrectly, and incorrectly in a few ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.276" offset="2037509">I think that, in fact, there would be several ways for this Court to approach it, all of which would actually help to clear up the law in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.149" offset="2084948">I think that even if one gets past the waiver point -- and the reason the Court shouldn't get past the waiver point is, among other things, because it wasn't raised -- we, of course, had no opportunity to put in evidence that, in fact, these corporations are run separately, independent decisionmaking, observation of corporate form, and all the other things that would normally go into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.217" offset="2185258">If you want to reach it, first of all, there is -- even on the standards articulated in the Respondent's brief, there is nothing in the records that supports it.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="529.489" offset="2222352">I thought you were saying we should not even -- not even -- not even address the situation where there is no special basis for ignoring the separate incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.797" offset="2271566">I -- of course, we should not get into questions of whether, in fact, the subsidiary was a sham, that there was control, all of that.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="554.522" offset="2322453">But the simple question of whether when you have a totally owned subsidiary, its actions are your actions.</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="564.044" stopTime="565.744">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="564.044" offset="2360592">Don't we have to reach that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="meir_feder" startTime="565.744" stopTime="800.298">
            <label>Mr. Meir Feder</label>
            <text syncTime="565.744" offset="2367384">--You certainly do have to reach that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.780" offset="2375534">The Court has reached it and decided it before, and has said that the mere parent-subsidiary relationship does not create attribution one to the other, most recently in Keeton, in which the Court cited some of its older cases for that very proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.778" offset="2471560">And I think that in -- another way to look at it is, even if you wanted to treat the sales in North Carolina as if they were made there directly by these Petitioners -- in other words, even if you picked -- assuming arguendo that you could attribute those sales directly to the Petitioners and not, as the court below found, treat them as not having been caused by them, that does not come close to satisfying what is required for general jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.451" offset="2614188">And in particular, in going back to Helicopteros and Gregory, just as the Rosenberg case was binding in Helicopteros on the point that mere purchases are not enough for general jurisdiction, here Consolidated Textile v. Gregory is binding on the flip side of that, which is that mere sales in the State are not enough for general jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.272" offset="2737486">Even if Gregory weren't binding, I think that you could look at Helicopteros and say there is no real basis for a distinction between mere purchases and mere sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.397" offset="2785970">But in fact, there is a case directly on point, and as well as a lot of case law from the time of Gregory more generally requiring much more substantial -- substantial physical presence in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.275" offset="2853470">In terms of -- I think no personal jurisdiction argument should go by without talking about International Shoe, and if you look at just the International Shoe line of cases, even aside from this issue of Gregory being binding, the decision below is equally, if not more, untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.676" offset="2959109">International Shoe itself recognizes -- in sort of carving out an area for what eventually came to be called general jurisdiction, it recognizes the extraordinary nature of the State power that we're talking about when we talk about general jurisdiction, which is this power to reach out and assert State power over things that by hypothesis have no relationship to contacts with the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.493" offset="3074361">International Shoe uses the language saying that you need continuous corporate operations within the State and says that these continuous corporate operations have to be so substantial and of such a nature as to justify this jurisdiction over conduct that is entirely unconnected to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.227" offset="3173313">The one case where the Court has upheld general jurisdiction since International Shoe over a corporation is Perkins, which was a case that involved the corporation's principal place of business, and in Helicopteros, following Perkins, when the Court articulated the standard there, the Court said that we're looking to see whether there are contacts of the sort that we found to exist in Perkins.</text>

            <text syncTime="800.298" offset="3305597">Perkins is kind of an unusual case, because it was a company that at the time was doing business only in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.654" offset="3343005">It was a Philippine mining company and it was World War II, so the mines couldn't be run.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.324" offset="3365679">So to the extent that the corporation was existing anywhere, it was in Ohio.</text>

            <text syncTime="828.948" offset="3420223">Those are unusual facts, but not unusual in terms of what is required to be able to assert general jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.554" offset="3454600">The Court in Keeton later described Perkins as essentially involving the corporation's principal place of business, and I think that's right because in order for the State to be able to assert jurisdiction over things unrelated to the State, you need that type of relationship equivalent to a citizen or resident that gives a State authority over the corporation's actions worldwide and not just -- because this goes far beyond specific jurisdiction where the State has a manifest interest in an accident or a claim that arose in the State or connected to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.416" offset="3634009">Helicopteros, just to circle back on that point, does say, we're looking for contacts of the sort found to exist in Perkins, and -- and as we said, said that even $4 million in purchases were not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.865" offset="3723870">I think that all of those cases help to make it clear why the mere sales here are not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.971" offset="3764308">And if there are no further questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Benjamin J. Horwich</label>
            <text syncTime="934.635" offset="3842988">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="937.218" offset="3853228">The North Carolina State court was wrong to assert general personal jurisdiction over Petitioners, extending potentially to any claim against them arising out of any conduct of theirs anywhere in the world, and there are several ways to see why that's wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.648" offset="3930969">Even if the Court were to accept the proposition that such contacts with North Carolina as there are in the record should be attributed to Petitioners, those contacts still don't rise to the level of what this Court has -- has demanded in terms of continuous and systematic contacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.045" offset="4012575">And even setting those more -- those more precedential tests aside, I think there's also a -- the result of the North Carolina court's decision is that the jurisdictional consequences here would be quite disproportionate to the contacts that -- that -- on which it would be based.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.327" offset="4113721">So if I can, I guess, turn for a moment to the continuous and systematic contacts proposition, which this Court has certainly not elaborated in its case law, but I think it -- it would be -- I think it's useful to speak of, of what exactly the Court was trying to get at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.837" offset="4179759">What we think the Court was trying to get at, particularly by, as my friend referred to, particularly by its reference in Helicopteros to Perkins as -- as being sort of a benchmark for what continuous and systematic contacts are, I think it requires seeing an active volitional undertaking by the -- by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.583" offset="4266695">It can't be based on the contact -- conduct of third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.404" offset="4282055">Obviously the continuous concept of existing without interruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.189" offset="4297101">And with respect to systematic, we think that that means there needs to be a plurality of contacts, they have to be of -- of different kinds or qualities in a sense of perhaps employment, as well as contractual, as well as regulatory, as well as property, as well as sales or purchases, and that those contacts together have to have some interrelationship that results in something that might be thought of as more than the sum of their parts.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="1080.243" offset="4425415">Well, suppose it's just a corporation that's registered to do business in North Carolina, and the connection with that registration; it says: I appoint so-and-so my agent to receive process for any and all claims?</text>

            <label>Mr. Benjamin J. Horwich</label>
            <text syncTime="1094.420" offset="4482048">Well, as -- as Mr. Feder referred -- referred to, there -- there is a division in the lower courts on whether that sort of a consent is effective to permit the State general jurisdiction over -- over the consenting party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.512" offset="4542443">That -- but the Court has, I -- I think, been -- been fairly clear in -- in -- in setting notions of -- of formal consent to one side when considering contacts-based cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.510" offset="4622482">And, so, in part, this case, therefore, doesn't present that question and we don't have a position, as the government, on that today, with respect to whether that's effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.116" offset="4664905">But it certainly is the case that simply because one entity in a Goodyear family of -- of related corporations has consented, that somehow that consent should extend to the entire enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.375" offset="4725927">And if I can, maybe, take a minute to talk about where we think the Respondents' view of -- of this enterprise jurisdiction goes wrong, because we touched on it only -- only briefly in our brief, which was, of course, filed before theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.551" offset="4778590">When -- when a court confronts a -- a set of -- a corporate family, if you will, there seem to be two principles that can be usefully applied in determining the jurisdictional consequences of that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.311" offset="4841597">One is the alter ego concept, which certainly doesn't seem to be supported on anything in the record here in the sense that there's -- that there's no sound suggestion in the record that -- that the European entities were somehow a sham, that they didn't have any separate existence, they were undercapitalized or any of the other indicia that you would see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.343" offset="4933757">And, so, to your point, Justice Scalia, I think it is certainly something the Court could say that the record here is no basis for that kind of a decision to disregard the corporate separateness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.901" offset="4975971">Then the other concept is the agency concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.103" offset="4992794">And I think that may be what -- what Respondents are placing somewhat greater reliance on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.257" offset="5013379">And we certainly -- we certainly have the view that an agent, acting on behalf of a principal within the scope of its agency, can take actions that create contacts with the jurisdiction that are, by virtue of the agency relationship, attributable back to the principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.087" offset="5096761">But there are -- there are two important things to realize, that that -- that that proposition is somewhat modest in that, first of all, simply because a -- a parent owns a subsidiary does not mean the subsidiary is the parent's agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.263" offset="5157470">Plenty of parents simply own subsidiaries as property or for various business reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.501" offset="5182443">It doesn't mean the subsidiary is automatically always acting as the agent of the parent for all purposes or any at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.070" offset="5208670">And -- and the second thing to be cautious about in applying the agency principle is that the agency relationship only runs one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.640" offset="5242943">That is to say, the agent can do something that creates a contact on behalf of the principal, but that's not to say that everything the principal does in its independent activities says anything about what contacts its agent has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.484" offset="5298322">That's exactly backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.936" offset="5304174">In the -- and, so, here the -- the allegation actually in the complaint is that the European companies are the agents of the parent -- of the -- of the Goodyear U.S. entity, that's -- that's paragraph 16 of the complaint at page 112 of -- 122 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.945" offset="5372197">So it -- it might be -- it -- it -- there might be an argument that something that the European subsidiaries have done, say, in Turkey is something that could be chargeable to the U.S. parent in a case where it was relevant what the parent's relationship with Turkey was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.407" offset="5441996">But what Respondents are asking for here, in effect, turns that completely around and suggests implicitly that the -- the -- this -- the parent of the Goodyear organization in the United States was somehow doing the bidding, acting at the direction and control of the European companies as principals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1354.070" offset="5520677">Mr. Horwich, could I ask you a different kind of question, and I apologize in advanced for taking you a little bit far afield?</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.407" offset="5541992">But -- but I wanted to ask you about a particular sentence in your brief that seems to have some relevance to, not the general jurisdiction question but some relevance to specific jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.782" offset="5591521">So this is on page 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.348" offset="5597790">You say:</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.400" offset="5601970">"If mere purposeful availment of commercial opportunities in a particular State, which is of course the test for a specific jurisdiction, if that purposeful availment were sufficient to subject an enterprise to the general jurisdiction of that State's courts, a corporation that sold its goods to an independent distributor intending that they be resold in all 50 States could potentially be brought to judgment in any State on any claim against it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.599" offset="5702802">So I -- I take that -- I understand that to read that you think that it is purposeful availment that subjects a company to specific jurisdiction -- not to general jurisdiction, but to specific jurisdiction -- if a corporation sold its goods to an independent distributor intending that they be resold in all 50 States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1506.571" offset="6130688">And specific jurisdiction by construction, by its very nature, is only going to be a determination -- whatever the contours of the specific rules that are used, it's going to never be more than the determination that jurisdiction in a claim, considering the relationship between the defendant, the forum, and the particular litigation gives rise to jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3404.939" offset="13724170">The purported integrated distribution that Respondents are pointing to as the basis for ignoring the corporate separation here, whatever else you could say about it and whether it's really any different from normal coordination, it only relates to the tiny fraction of Petitioners' business that involved tires going to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.525" offset="13842453">So -- where they didn't normally market their products -- and so, of course, everything that they sent to the United States was only when the U.S. affiliate reached out to get tires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.166" offset="13889055">That does not -- under any theory of which I'm aware, even the most aggressive enterprise theory, that would not account for a basis for merging the two companies and treating parent and sub as if they were one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.377" offset="13953944">As far as the hypothetical about China goes, I wanted to briefly address that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.115" offset="13976827">Of course, to the extent that there are a lot of tires sent in from China or anywhere else to North Carolina or any other State, there will be specific jurisdiction most likely in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.304" offset="14021653">Our position here is simply that the fact that tires are coming in, of which you may have specific jurisdiction, is no basis to say that you can also bring in North Carolina what general jurisdiction would allow you to bring: claims from workplace accidents in China, lease disputes, and whatever else.</text>
