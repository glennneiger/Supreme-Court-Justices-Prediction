            <label>Mr. Neal Kumar Katyal</label>
            <text syncTime="12.308" offset="153663">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.093" offset="164739">For 13 years, Arizona has permitted private citizens to contribute money to private organizations set up by private individuals and has let those organizations use that money towards scholarships when individuals apply for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.583" offset="218760">The Ninth Circuit erred first in finding that the taxpayer plaintiffs had standing, and second in striking the program down.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.487" offset="242375">On standing, this lawsuit fails each of the three necessary elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.855" offset="259824">Regarding injury in fact, the key point is this: Not a cent of the Respondent's money goes to fund religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.378" offset="289917">If you placed an electronic tag to track and monitor each cent that the Respondent plaintiffs pay in tax, not a cent, not a fraction of a cent, would go into any religious school's coffers.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="58.353" offset="337774">Mr. Katyal, their point is that this tax money does belong to the State that private individuals are using, because it is money that, even by the new amendment, says either you pay it to the State or you use it for this purpose, but it's the State's money and it's giving you by its largesse the right to redirect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.616" offset="430874">That's their argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Neal Kumar Katyal</label>
            <text syncTime="83.001" offset="436412">Right.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="83.568" stopTime="89.722">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="83.568" offset="438711">So it would be the taxpayers' tax dollars being spent on religion, if they could sustain their claim.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neal_kumar_katyal" startTime="89.722" stopTime="161.884">
            <label>Mr. Neal Kumar Katyal</label>
            <text syncTime="89.722" offset="463266">There are two problems with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.657" offset="470998">One has to do with injury in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.074" offset="476641">The other has to do with redressability.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.526" offset="482492">With respect to injury in fact, our point is as you track the taxpayers' dollars, it doesn't actually fund any religious program, unlike the -- unlike Flast and other cases in which this Court has considered taxpayer standing for religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.951" offset="544246">Their complaint is not that the government is spending money that the taxpayers have -- money that has been extracted and spent of the taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.307" offset="581653">Their complaint is that someone else's money is not being extracted and spent enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.425" offset="602133">And the relevant language in Flast says that for taxpayer standing to occur, it's, quote, "his tax money" must be extracted and spent, and here that is not occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.650" offset="642988">Now, with respect to the other argument, not injury in fact but addressability and causation, our point is this: It's speculative as to whether or not that chain of events that you spelled out, Justice Sotomayor, would actually happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.207" offset="693248">As this Court said in Cuno, for example, when a tax credit is given sometimes that actually reduces the amount of money the government has to spend.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.313" offset="725640">It doesn't increase it.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.663" offset="731073">And so that's different than the direct outlay that was at issue in Flast.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="161.884" stopTime="190.653">
            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="161.884" offset="751971">Then is it constitutional if we get a new system?</text>
            <text syncTime="164.669" offset="763047">Here's what the system will be: The taxpayers who are religious will be able to check a box and the check that they send to the IRS -- it's a possible system -- what happens is that that check is cashed by an official and the cash is given to the local priest to say prayers for the individual who contributed the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.118" offset="856879">And in your view, there is no one who could challenge that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Neal Kumar Katyal</label>
            <text syncTime="190.653" offset="867015">Well, let me say two things about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.105" offset="876837">First is: That is not all that different, Justice Breyer, than what we have today with 501(c)(3) deductions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="199.175" stopTime="215.852">
            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="199.175" offset="901078">The difference is, of course, that in the one case it's a deduction and in this case you are paying it 100 percent with money that would otherwise go into the coffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.948" offset="936187">I understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.248" offset="941411">But I am interested in, conceptually, does the government think that there is no one who could challenge that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neal_kumar_katyal" startTime="215.852" stopTime="238.948">
            <label>Mr. Neal Kumar Katyal</label>
            <text syncTime="215.852" offset="967847">I don't think that any taxpayer could challenge that.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.054" offset="980595">That is, depending on the hypothetical, Justice Breyer, I'm not sure if the government is specifying which religious organizations might be eligible for the check box.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.910" offset="1016017">But if the government is doing something that is underinclusive and only giving tax credits to one set of religious organizations, that's a Texas Monthly problem, as this Court--</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="238.948" offset="1060216">If you go back into history, it could have been the case that the -- as long as they were fair to every religion, the first Congress could have funded prayers throughout the nation in churches for anyone to go and pray and that would not have violated the Establishment Clause, or if it had, nobody could have challenged it.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.916" offset="1160108">Two things on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.099" offset="1164810">First is: We are only talking about standing, not the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.468" offset="1174319">And with respect to standing, if the government funded only religious organizations or religious prayer, I do think that other organizations would have standing -- not as a taxpayer, because this Court has been very careful in Flast and in Hein to say there is an extremely narrow exception for taxpayer standing, a narrow exception to Frothingham, but other organizations would have Texas Monthly standing because they're--</text>

            <text syncTime="303.141" offset="1316948">And I think that accords with this Court's general reluctance to confer taxpayer standing in this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="471.351" offset="1989757">First is, I do think it is very much just like Frothingham, in which Frothingham had to deal with this exact problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.287" offset="2009506">The Court had conferred standing in taxpayer standing case after taxpayer standing case and then, when it was teed up and presented to the Court as a question about Article III standing, the Court said: No, we shouldn't have granted taxpayer standing in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.845" offset="2063736">So my answer to you is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.131" offset="2068961">Now, I do think that this Court's decision in Hein I think reiterated some of the fundamental principles and the limits on Flast.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.135" offset="2100935">And I think the Court -- the plurality made quite clear that it would go no further than the facts of Flast.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.439" offset="2122146">And to grant standing here, you have to go -- tremendously depart from what Flast is about: A direct government outlay of funds out of -- taking money out of someone's pocket to fund religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3441.379" offset="13869934">And you are quite right that in Flast that was the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.350" offset="13889787">But why isn't it, given that it is a nexus in Flast, what was in Flast, why isn't it also a nexus where you have this complicated system which is designed to make the ordinary taxpayer pay a little more in this kind of instance, where what you've done is directly subtract from the treasury $5,000 cash to turn over, in the view of the plaintiffs, to a purely forbidden religious purpose?</text>

            <text syncTime="3475.786" offset="14007547">--Justice Breyer, two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.786" offset="14011517">First, the relevant language in Flast is at page 106, it's not what the nexus test, it's the definition of what the actual tax payer claim is and it requires that</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.475" offset="14046312">"his tax money being extracted was. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3492.396" offset="14074002">And that's the general description Flast says about how taxpayer standing will go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.364" offset="14089885">If there is any doubt about that, Valley Forge makes that clear because the dissenters said exactly what you said, which is look, let's just look to economic effects and that alone will be enough and it's just Property Clause, Tax And Spending Clause, it doesn't really matter, it's the bottom line on the treasury and this Court said no, that isn't the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3513.909" offset="14159997">General Katyal, Flast could not have meant that it is your particular dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.046" offset="14176611">There would be no way to know it's your particular dollar and that would be a silly and fictional thing to say as the plurality opinion in Hein makes clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.133" offset="14208899">What Flast said was that taxpayer dollars, not your dollar, but taxpayer dollars, are going to this activity in the same way that it's going to the activity here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Neal Kumar Katyal</label>
            <text syncTime="3537.425" offset="14254143">I disagree -- first is I don't think that is what Flast is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.329" offset="14269712">I think Flast is about that micro-fraction of a cent that is coming from your pocket and being used to fund religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.733" offset="14295312">And that is what Madison complained about, it may be very small, it may be 3 cents, but there is a special harm of conscious when it's your money, your hard earned money being used to fund a program directly as to which you don't like.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="3558.921" offset="14340033">Flast talk about a nexus the way Justice Breyer said and here is a taxpayer challenging a provision of the tax code, an active pursuant to the tax and spending power that grants a tax benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.531" offset="14394472">That's as close a nexus as you are going to get using the language of Flast.</text>

            <label>Mr. Neal Kumar Katyal</label>
            <text syncTime="3576.749" offset="14411400">Again, I think that doesn't deal with the direct injury on the taxpayer, which is the language of Flast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.553" offset="14430626">Even if you disagree with me, the harm here is a lot more speculative, just like Cuno, because you have to posit in order for the harm to exist to this taxpayer, that tax credits will cost the government money, not save it, that his tax burden will go up as opposed to someone else's tax burden, a corporation and the like, or you have to posit that the government won't cut spending in order to make up the shortfall in revenues that he says is going to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.954" offset="14536161">You're going to have to do all of those things, none of which you have to do in a Flast situation because it's a direct outlay of funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.441" offset="14562179">If I could just can spend a moment on Justice Kennedy's question about state action, which of course they didn't advance below as the Ninth Circuit said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.362" offset="14593839">I think it's this Court's precedence are quite clear in saying that the fact that the government regulates or funds something doesn't transform it into a state actor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.218" offset="14633232">If it did, then all 501(c)(3)'s would become state actors, and that, I think, would be an enormously damaging precedent for this Court to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.840" offset="14675759">Rather, I think what Blum says is that it requires the performance of a traditional executive prerogative -- additional government prerogative and here all the STO is doing is funding -- it's handing out money and it's doing so on a neutral basis, anyone can form an STO, and anyone can fund one.</text>
