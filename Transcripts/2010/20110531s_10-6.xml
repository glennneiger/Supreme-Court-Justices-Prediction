            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">This case involves a question of patent laws specifically the intent that is quite -- required for a violation of the provision of the Patent Act which prohibits a party from actively inducing another party to commit infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.797" offset="181624">The petitioners in this case whom we will call Pentalpha argue that a party cannot be held liable unless the party has actual knowledge that the induced acts will constitute infringement which requires knowledge of patenting question.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.223" offset="255289">The Federal Circuit on the other hand, held that it is enough if a party should've known that the induced acts will constitute infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.323" offset="295727">Now, the facts of the case are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.671" offset="305131">The respondent in this case, SEB, designed a cool-touch deep fryer and obtained a U.S. patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.669" offset="341076">Now this product as the name suggests was a deep fryer manufactured for home use with an exterior that would remain cool when it was touched during operation even though the oil inside was boiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.085" offset="398754">This was a successful product and Pentalpha decided to copy it and produce it for sale in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.055" offset="438669">It could've sent somebody to any store in the United States where this was sold to look at the SEB fryer and see that whether there was a U.S. patent label on the back but it didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.028" offset="486525">It purchased one of the SEB fryers in Hong Kong knowing that a product manufactured for sale outside the United States would be unlikely to have a U.S. patent label and sure enough, this product did not have a U.S. patent label.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.048" offset="546607">It then copied the SEB fryer in all respects other than some cosmetic respects and prepared to market it in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.184" offset="587149">But before it did that, it hired a lawyer in the United States to do a patent search.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.614" offset="608883">It failed to tell the lawyer one very important fact, namely that it had copied the SEB fryer.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.413" offset="636050">Now, had it done that, presumably, the lawyer would've found the SEB patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.158" offset="655067">But without that information, the lawyer did not find the patent and sent a letter to Pentalpha saying that its product would not infringe a U.S. patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.393" offset="703969">Now, turning back to the legal issue in the case, the -- the Federal Circuit, we hold, went too far in concluding that it is enough if a party should've known that the acts induced would constitute infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.652" offset="777007">Based largely on this Court's decision in the 1964 case called Aro II, we hold that the statutory provision in question here requires knowledge that the induced acts constitute infringement but we also hold that an old and sensible doctrine called the doctrine of willful blindness applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.756" offset="869480">This doctrine means that a party who may be liable if it knows a fact, cannot escape liability by deliberately taking acts to shield itself from direct actual knowledge of facts that it knows are very likely to be true, and that is exactly what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.489" offset="956416">This case really provides a textbook example of willful blindness.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.494" offset="976374">And we therefore hold that Pentalpha was properly held libel for inducing infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.870" offset="1001974">The judgment of the Federal Circuit is therefore affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.864" offset="1017856">Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
