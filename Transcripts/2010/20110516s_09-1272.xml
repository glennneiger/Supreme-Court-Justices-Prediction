            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Alito has the opinion of the Court this morning in Case 09-1272, Kentucky versus King.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.845" offset="133872">He has asked that I announce it for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.486" offset="144426">This case comes to us on the writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.442" offset="164174">In this case, police officers smelled marijuana outside an apartment door, knocked loudly, and announced their presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.788" offset="193640">As soon as the officers began knocking, they heard noises that, in their view, indicated that the occupants were destroying drug-related evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.907" offset="234078">The officers entered the apartment without a warrant to prevent the destruction of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.395" offset="256021">Respondent was convicted of drug-related offenses based on evidence that the officers found inside the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.121" offset="286950">Now, it is well-established that the rule of exigent circumstances which includes the need to prevent destruction of evidence is an exception to the warrant requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.011" offset="326447">We do not decide whether exigent circumstances actually existed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.471" offset="348285">We, like the Kentucky Supreme Court, assume that there was an exigency.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.397" offset="372005">The question before us concerns an exception to the exigent circumstances rule that has been developed by lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.571" offset="400739">Lower courts have held that when police create an exigency, the search is unconstitutional, even though an exigency existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.943" offset="438251">This is known as the "police-created exigency" doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.790" offset="453611">The Kentucky Supreme Court applied the police-created exigency doctrine in this case, overturning respondent's conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.661" offset="485063">Assuming there was an exigency, the Kentucky Supreme Court held that the exigent circumstances rule could not justify the search because the police should have foreseen that their conduct would prompt the occupants to destroy evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.517" offset="544517">In short, the Court held that the police had impermissibly created the exigency.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.222" offset="571371">For the reason stated in our opinion, we reject this interpretation of the exigent circumstances rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.407" offset="596031">The conduct of the police, prior to their entry into the apartment, was entirely lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.389" offset="619959">They banged on the door and announced their presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.051" offset="630617">They did not violate the Fourth Amendment, nor did they threaten to violate the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.463" offset="652246">Under these circumstances, the officers' warrantless entry to prevent the destruction of evidence was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.345" offset="679832">We therefore reverse the judgment of the Kentucky Supreme Court and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.649" offset="713059">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting Opinion.</text>
