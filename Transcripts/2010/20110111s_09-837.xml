            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Most of us who work for wages pay taxes on those wages under laws Congress has enacted to collect funds for Social Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.070" offset="141730">Congress has however exempted from the Social Security taxes students who work for a school where they are enrolled and regularly taking classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.902" offset="181018">The easiest example is the college student who buses tables in the dining hall to earn some extra money.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.050" offset="205573">He doesn't have to pay Social Security taxes out of his earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.459" offset="223232">This case however is not so easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.579" offset="231696">It's about medical residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.647" offset="240055">These are doctors who have graduated from medical school but are pursuing additional medical training to become certified as a specialist in a particular field.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.214" offset="278298">Most doctors in this country go through this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.034" offset="293554">They largely learn by working a lot, 50 to 80 hours per week, caring for patients and performing procedures under the supervision of senior residents and faculty members known as attending physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.533" offset="351545">The residents get paid by their school or teaching hospital around $50,000 a year and the school also pays for things like malpractice insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.162" offset="394073">The question here more or less boils down to whether these residents are workers who study, so they have to pay employment taxes that other workers do or are they students who work so they fall within the student exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.499" offset="455408">Now, the language that Congress enacted doesn't help very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.927" offset="469096">It just says that you are exempt from the taxes if you work for a school where you are enrolled and regularly attending classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.528" offset="503578">The generality of that provision is not surprising.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.371" offset="514863">There are a lot of different scenarios that can come up and Congress can't be expected to have addressed the nuances of everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.734" offset="548404">That's where the Treasury Department comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.984" offset="557390">Congress delegated to that Department the authority to issue regulations implementing the tax code.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.190" offset="582154">Now, the Department recently issued a regulation saying that if you work 40 hours or more a week, they are going to consider you a worker, subject to the taxes no matter how educational or part of a formal course of study your work might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.935" offset="645162">And the Department helpfully gave an example of what it meant saying that for example, medical residents would not qualify for the student exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.304" offset="682674">The Mayo Teaching Hospital sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.440" offset="691137">Mayo cared about this because if its residents had to pay the taxes, Mayo as the employer had to chip in as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.702" offset="724261">Now, in a case like this, we just don't decide what we think the right answer is.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.242" offset="742337">First, we look at the law that Congress passed to see if it answers the particular question before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.838" offset="764803">I've already explained that it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.113" offset="773893">And if Congress has given an agency the power to issue rules implementing the statute, we let the agency do just that and uphold the agency's view so long as it is reasonable even if it's not the same answer we might have given in the first instance ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.830" offset="840767">So the question is, is it reasonable for the Treasury Department to say that if you work in a job for more than 40 hours a week, we're going to count you as a worker even if that work is part of a program of study.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.886" offset="893012">And we think it is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.699" offset="900221">You have to draw the line according to some principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.771" offset="912551">Treasury could have said we're going to look at each program and see if you're really mostly learning or mostly doing things you already know how to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.475" offset="943271">But that would have taken the time of a lot of tax department employees with no real reason to think we'd be any closer to what Congress was trying to get at.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.581" offset="979738">So to sum up, we have a difficult question under the tax code.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.114" offset="997919">Congress gave general guidance but can't be said to have answered the question itself in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.558" offset="1019653">Congress did however direct an expert agency to implement the law and that agency has given a direct answer to the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.125" offset="1049955">And that answer is a reasonable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.582" offset="1059777">We therefore defer to the agency's view that medical residents are workers who study not students who work.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.091" offset="1089766">And that means that we affirm the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.832" offset="1112754">All members of the Court joined the opinion to that effect, except Justice Kagan who did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
