            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">This is a case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.360" offset="126892">In the course of a routine automobile stop, police officers lawfully arrested a passenger in the car, petitioner Davis, and then conducted a search of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.953" offset="169211">The police found a gun that belongs to Davis, and Davis was indicted and later convicted in federal court on the charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.550" offset="215604">At the time of the search in this case, binding Eleventh Circuit precedent had interpreted one of this Court's Fourth Amendment cases, New York versus Belton to authorize vehicle searches like the one conducted here, a vehicle search incident to a recent occupant's arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.225" offset="290314">Two years later, while Davis' appeal in this case was still pending, this Court rejected the Eleventh Circuit's interpretation of Belton in a case called Arizona versus Gant.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.732" offset="336394">The parties agree that under Gant, the vehicle search in this case violated the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.723" offset="360323">The question before us in this case is whether the evidence obtained during the search, the gun, should be suppressed under the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.396" offset="398984">This Court has long recognized that the exclusionary rule is not a personal constitutional right but a prudential doctrine, the sole purpose of which is to deter police misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.568" offset="443705">The rule applies only when the deterrent's benefits of suppression outweigh its costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.671" offset="468156">Thus, this Court's cases upheld that when the police conduct a search in objectively reasonable reliance on the subsequently invalidated search warrant or statute, exclusion of evidence is unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.319" offset="522700">We now conclude that the same result should obtain in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.980" offset="537328">When the police conduct a search in objectively reasonable reliance on binding judicial precedent, the exclusionary rule does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.802" offset="572646">Suppressing evidence in such cases would deter no police misconduct and would impose substantial costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.478" offset="603366">In cases like this one where the applicable precedent is a decision of a Court of Appeals, this rule will not prevent the development of Fourth Amendment case law since challenges may be brought in other Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.717" offset="648296">We do not reach the question whether a particular petitioner who obtains the overruling of one of this Court's Fourth Amendment precedents should have the benefit of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.875" offset="688943">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.498" offset="703363">Justice Sotomayor has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.002" offset="717469">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg has joined.</text>
