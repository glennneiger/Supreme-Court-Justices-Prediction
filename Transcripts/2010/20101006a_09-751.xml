            <text syncTime="2947.428" offset="11895160">Now, let me suggest a couple and see what you think, and maybe you can think of some others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.714" offset="11908326">You could have a judge make the decision, since the First Amendment is involved, not the jury, and the judge could say whether in this instance it was reasonable for the defendant to think that it was important to interfere with the emotional life of that individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.460" offset="11991291">You could say if that was so, there will still be no -- there would be no punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.447" offset="12011248">There could be ordinary damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="2995.992" offset="12089407">So what I'm doing is suggesting a number of thoughts of ways of trying to do what I'm trying to accomplish, to allow this tort to exist but not allow the existence of it to interfere with an important public message where that is a reasonable thing to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="3053.197" offset="12318239">At the other extreme, for a compare and contrast, is what they seek in this case, what the trial judge gave them in this case, which is: In an unspecified period of time that each individual will call their mourning period, no one, at any time, any place, any manner, may say any word that that mourner says caused me emotional distress.</text>

            <text syncTime="3428.797" offset="13820594">You said that a -- a more standard antiwar demonstration, "get out of Iraq", "war is immoral", at this funeral, same distance, same sized signs -- that a more standard antiwar demonstration would be protected by the First Amendment from an intentional infliction of emotional distress suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.775" offset="13900528">And I'm wondering why that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.877" offset="13908888">If you think that what is -- what causes the lack of protection here is the kind of glomming to a private funeral, the exploitation of a private person's grief, the -- the appearance for no other reason than to gain publicity at a private event -- if that's the problem, why doesn't it also apply to a standard, you know, "get out of Iraq", "war is wrong", kind of demonstration?</text>
