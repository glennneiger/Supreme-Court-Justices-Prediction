          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="6.753" stopTime="538.201">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="6.753" offset="132430">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.628" offset="155941">The petitioner, Vincent Staub worked as an angiography technician for the respondent, Proctor Hospital until 2004 when he was fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.405" offset="203065">Staub and Proctor dispute the facts surrounding with firing, but because a jury found for Staub in his claim of employment discrimination against Proctor, we describe the facts viewed in the light most favorable to Staub.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.546" offset="259594">While employed by Proctor, Staub was a member of the United States Army Reserve, which required him to attend drill one weekend per month and to train full time for two to three weeks a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.019" offset="309541">Both Janice -- Janice Mulally, Staub's immedia -- Staub's immediate supervisor and Michael Korenchuk, Mulally's supervisor, were hostile to Staub's military obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.648" offset="363980">In January 2004, Mulally issued Staub a disciplinary warning for purportedly violating a company rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.596" offset="399820">The warning included a directive that Staub to report to Mulally or to Korenchuk when he had no patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.502" offset="431480">According to Staub, Mulally's justification for the disciplinary warning was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.790" offset="456558">In April 2004, Korenchuk informed Linda Buck, Proctor's vice president of human resources, that Staub had violated the directive in the January disciplinary warning, an accusation which according to Staub was also false.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.306" offset="522595">Buck relied on Korenchuk's accusation, however, and after reviewing Staub's personnel file, she decided to fire him.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.339" offset="558749">The termination notice stated that Staub had ignored the directive issued in the January 2004 warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.693" offset="588215">Staub sued Proctor under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 or USERRA, which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of a person's membership in or obligation to a uniformed service.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.087" offset="669717">It provides that an employer shall be considered to have engaged in employment discrimination if the person's membership or obligation is a “motivating factor in the employer's action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="154.616" offset="723843">Staub claimed that his discharge was motivated by hostility to his obligations as a military reservist.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.823" offset="748711">His contention was not that Buck, who was the -- the Proctor agent who did the actual firing, not that Buck had any such hostility but that Mulally and Korenchuk did and that their actions influenced Buck's ultimate employment decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.277" offset="822481">The jury found in Staub's favor and awarded $57,000 in change in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.939" offset="853201">The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that Proctor was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.899" offset="877025">The Court observed that Staub had brought what the Seventh Circuit calls a “cat's paw case", meaning that he sought to hold his employer liable for the animus of a supervisor who was not charged with making the ultimate employment decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.978" offset="941286">The theory is that that agent is just the "cat's paw" of agents further down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.932" offset="973155">It explained that under Seventh Circuit precedent a “cat's paw” case could not succeed unless the nondecisionmaker exercised such singular influence over the decisionmaker that the decision to terminate was the product of “blind reliance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="233.786" offset="1040551">It then noted that Buck looked beyond what Mulally and Korenchuk said relying in part on her review of Staub's personnel file.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.770" offset="1080466">Because the undisputed evidence established that Buck was not wholly dependent on the advice of Korenchuk and Mulally, the Court held that Proctor was entitled to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.752" offset="1120381">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reversed the judgment of the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.106" offset="1141802">The central difficulty in this case, of course, is construing the statutory phrase “motivating factor in the employment's action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="269.776" offset="1184538">When the company official who makes the decision to take an adverse employment action is personally acting out of hostility to the employee's membership in or obligation to a uniformed service, a motivating factor obviously exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.977" offset="1241276">The problem we confront in this case arises when that official has no discriminatory animus, as Buck did not, but is influenced by previous company action that is the product of a like animus in someone else and someone else who is an agent of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.944" offset="1309194">In approaching this question, we start from the premise that when Congress creates a federal tort, it adopts the background of general tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.693" offset="1344199">Intentional torts such as this, as distinguished from negligent or reckless torts, generally require that the actor intend the consequences of an act, not simply the act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.179" offset="1394145">Proctor contents that the employer is not liable unless the de facto decisionmaker rather than an agent on whom that decisionmaker relies is motivated by discriminatory animus.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.941" offset="1441165">We think that proposed rule is overly narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.246" offset="1458406">Animus and responsibility for the adverse action can both be -- can both be attributed to the earlier agent (here, Staub's supervisors) if the adverse action is the intended consequence of that agent's discriminatory conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.260" offset="1522458">So long as the agent intends, for discriminatory reasons, that the adverse action occur, he has the scienter required to be liable under USERRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.823" offset="1564672">And -- and his scienter can be attributed to his employer since he is an agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.943" offset="1593198">And it is axi -- axiomatic under tort law, that the exercise of judgment by the decisionmaker does not prevent the earlier agent's action (and hence the earlier agent's discriminatory animus) from being the proximate cause of the harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.981" offset="1649309">Proximate cause excludes only those links that are too remote, purely contingent or indirect.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.549" offset="1679611">We do not think that the ultimate decisionmaker's exercise of judgment automatically renders the link to the supervisor's bias "remote" or "purely contingent."</text>
            <text syncTime="404.715" offset="1724332">Moreover, the approach urged upon us by Proctor gives an unlikely meaning to a provision that is designed to prevent employer discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.393" offset="1762994">An employer's authority to reward, punish or dismiss is often allocated among multiple agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.406" offset="1790997">The one who makes the ultimate decision does so, on the basis of performance assessments by other supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.098" offset="1817851">Proctor's view would have the consequence that if an employer isolates a personnel official from an employee's supervisors, vests the decision to take adverse employment actions in that official alone, and asks -- and asks that official to review the employee's personnel file before taking the adverse action, then the employer will be effectively shielded from discriminatory acts and recommendations of supervisors that were designed and intended to produce the adverse action.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.856" offset="1936865">That seems to us an implausible meaning of the text, and one that is not compelled by its words.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.466" offset="1959330">We therefore hold that if a supervisor performs an act motivated by antimilitary animus that is intended by the supervisor to cause an adverse employment action, and if that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment action, then the employer is liable under USERRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.504" offset="2027457">Applying our analysis to the facts of this case, it is clear that the Seventh Circuit's judgment must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.336" offset="2054729">There was evidence that Mulally's and Korenchuk's actions were motivated by hostility toward Staub's military obligations, that Mulally's and Korenchuk's actions caused Buck to fire Staub, and that both Mulally and Korenchuk had the specific intent to cause Staub to be dis -- to be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.866" offset="2136858">Whether the variance between the jury instruction in this case and our -- and the rule we announced today was harmless error or should mandate a new trial, it is a matter that the Seventh Circuit may consider in the first instance on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.859" offset="2196835">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.291" offset="2214599">Justice Alito has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.694" offset="2236228">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
