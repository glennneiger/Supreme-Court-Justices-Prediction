            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">This case arises out of an auto accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.399" offset="119056">The passenger sitting in the backseat of a minivan at the isle was killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.242" offset="142357">The survivor brought tort suit in the California State Court and their argument was that the manufacture should have installed a lap-and-shoulder belts in that backseat and not just lap belts which is what was installed.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.026" offset="209544">The California Court said that state tort liability based on that theory was preempted by the Department of Transportation Regulation, its Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 which we've considered before and that particular standard said that manufacturers have to install seatbelts in the back of the minivan, but the belts can be either lap-and-shoulder belts or simple lap belts.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.234" offset="326363">Now, the California Court said, "Well, that rule preempts the tort suit because the tort suit would takeaway from the manufacturer, the choice that the regulation gave him."</text>
            <text syncTime="66.788" offset="372548">And since it conflicts with the federal regulation, the federal law prevails and the state tort suit is out.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.336" offset="402745">Now, in holding that, the California Court relied on a case of this Court called Geier.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.476" offset="427301">In Geier we consider that same regulation but a different part and the part we considered required manufacturers to install some kind of a passive restraint system.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.398" offset="475052">But like this, it gave them a choice of system and say, “Airbags or automatic seatbelts or something else.”</text>
            <text syncTime="100.239" offset="506399">And in that case, we said that regulation preempted a lawsuit against the manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.880" offset="528969">That case involved the suit which said you have to install airbags.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.041" offset="549554">And the manufacturer said, "No,” it says, "I can install either airbags or seatbelt or some other things.”</text>
            <text syncTime="116.936" offset="573168">And we said it was preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.828" offset="580692">Because we look at the regulation's history and we look at the agencies explanation of the regulation and we look at their current understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.628" offset="615905">And on that basis, we thought, "Well, they really do want to give the manufacturers of choice, that's an insignificant object of this regulation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="138.513" offset="659477">The agency thinks that by giving them a choice, they'll get better safety regulation and that's up to them so it's preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.019" offset="689465">Now, we do hear just what we did in Geier.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.566" offset="703676">We look at the history, the explanation, the purposes, why did they do it, and after doing the same kind of examination, we come to the opposite conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.405" offset="747039">Because here, we think that the history and the agency's explanation, and their current understanding of the whole thing showed that indeed they did allow the manufacturers to have a choice between lap belts and lap-and-shoulder belts, but that was not a significant objective of what they were trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.868" offset="820914">They had nothing to do with, didn't have much to do anyway with the safety concerns but rather that choice simply reflected an agency judgment about comparative cause and benefits and that here, just wasn't sufficient to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.699" offset="884234">They thought it was so important that the states can't reach a different decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.172" offset="902102">As far as we could tell, from looking at the history and the background and everything, they wouldn't have cared that states reached a different decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.047" offset="929583">So, for that reason, we conclude that state tort law here does not stand as an obstacle to achieving an important federal objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.665" offset="972110">The choice wasn't that important.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.825" offset="980679">The state lawsuit is not preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.324" offset="990710">The judgment of the California Court is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.747" offset="1004398">Justice Sotomayor has filed a concurring opinion, Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment and Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
