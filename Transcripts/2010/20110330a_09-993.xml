            <text syncTime="300.622" offset="1307941">Under the FDA Regulation 314.80 and 314.98, we have a myriad of disclosure obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.628" offset="1335944">Any time a generic learns about an adverse report, it has to report it to the FDA, it has to investigate it, and if it doesn't do that then it's not in compliance with its Federal obligations and the FDA has plenary authority to take all sorts of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.137" offset="1398011">But just as the Court said in the Buckman decision, without dissent, when a company doesn't make appropriate disclosures to the FDA, even if people are hurt by that, even if it's -- if it causes people to be injured and States might otherwise want to compensate them for them, those disclosure obligations are up to the FDA with its discretion to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.103" offset="1493828">And the Court looked directly to Congress in section 337.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.138" offset="1510024">So what's -- so what's the conflict with State law, meaning you have an obligation to keep your label as it is, but if you also have a Federal obligation to advise the FDA of adverse -- of adverse results and of needs for change, why can't you then comply with a duty to warn obligation because you can go to the -- to the FDA?</text>

            <text syncTime="377.289" offset="1614618">Well, first of all, there's a little bit of a difference between reporting all of the adverse events, which we clearly do, and asking the FDA to make a determination that the FDA has said is only for the FDA to make with respect to generic companies.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.369" offset="1810850">Well, if you could go to the FDA, why shouldn't we look at this suit in this way: That the plaintiffs are bringing a standard failure to warn claim; that you then have a preemption defense, that you'll say it's impossible; and then in order to litigate that preemption defense, the question will be, well, if you had gone to the FDA, what would the FDA have done?</text>
            <text syncTime="447.182" offset="1894128">Would it in fact have required both brand names and generics to change the label?</text>

            <text syncTime="470.965" offset="1989319">For a State to hold us liable for not asking the FDA is asking a State jury to put itself into the shoes of the FDA, to speculate how the FDA would have decided hypothetical issues, which ArkLa says is foreclosed in an area where the Federal Government, the Federal agency, has exclusive authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.026" offset="2065492">And in Buckman, the Court said that would disrupt and usurp the discretion of the agency to decide whether to punish and how to punish disclosure.</text>

            <text syncTime="500.984" offset="2109377">Well, Buckman -- Buckman was arguably a little bit different, in that there's a concern expressed in that case that requiring allowing the State suit to go forward would cause manufacturers to basically inundate the agency with proposals and warning revisions, so that there would be so many things that the agency wouldn't even be able to process them, and they would become meaningless to the consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.182" offset="2214181">That doesn't seem to me to be a concern in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.859" offset="2268829">But I would submit, Your Honor, that what lay at the core of the Buckman decision was that the relationship, the disclosures, between the Federal agency and its regulated party, are inherently Federal and States simply don't have a business trying to enforce those obligations, because that does take away from the authority and the discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.705" offset="2352212">And the Court looked to section 337 as evidence that Congress intended that violations of the FDCA be enforced by the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1289.774" offset="5264551">In 27 years of enforcement under Hatch-Waxman, the FDA has never once said that a generic drug that uses the brand label, as required under 505(j) of the statute is misbranded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.617" offset="5319931">And the -- look, I understand that from the consumer's perspective it may not make a lot of sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.854" offset="5344799">But what Congress specifically said is that a generic has to bear the same label, and it's because they do have different purposes, different functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.376" offset="5378968">Congress said that whenever there is a brand drug on the market that no longer is protected by its patent monopoly but has been selling for $10 or $20 a pill, we want to have generics selling for pennies for the pill, and they've given branded and generics different obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.338" offset="5450752">And the different obligations are seen most clearly through the prism of the Wyeth case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.307" offset="5470605">The Wyeth case was -- it was critical in the Wyeth case that this Court found that the brand company had the ability, had the obligation, to use the CBE regulations to actually change the label, whereas here what the FDA has said time and time again is: We'll tell a generic when the generic has to change the label, because we don't assume that the generics are going to know when the label should change because they don't have the same basis of clinical testing and results.</text>

            <text syncTime="1409.101" offset="5741861">But, again, the keys to understanding the -- the generic industry -- generics rarely even get adverse reports because if a doctor prescribes a drug, the doctor prescribes it as the brand, and then checks off the box that says a generic can be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.563" offset="5803719">If a patient comes and tells him about an adverse report, the doctor has no idea which generic of the 15 that might be in the market actually was dispensed, so he'll actually tell the brand company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1818.781" offset="7380574">The -- to focus first on the CBE issue, one of the things this Court noted in Levine is that even under the CBE process, the ultimate decision about whether the labeling is changed rests with the FDA, not with the manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.291" offset="7438566">The -- the fundamental issue in Levine was that the primary responsibility for labeling rested with the manufacturer, not with the agency, subject to the agency's review.</text>

Levine, is the obligation under 21 CFR 201.57(e), which you call 201.80(e) because they -- they renumbered it -- that the label warnings shall be revised as soon as there's reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with the drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.499" offset="7595405">The government says, and the regulatory structure makes clear, that that provision applies with full force to generic drug manufacturers, not just to name-brand drug manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.741" offset="7640336">It is the regulatory implementation of the obligation under the Federal misbranding statute, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2) that says you can't sell a drug that doesn't have adequate warnings about its risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.816" offset="7704701">So, when you're -- when the manufacturer is confronted with information that the warnings on its drug are not adequate, it -- the way it -- the way it should respond is by immediately going to the FDA and saying to the agency: We have this new information; we ask you, not that we want a different warning from the name brand, but we ask you to approve a stronger warning on both the name-brand product and its generic equivalents.</text>

            <text syncTime="3306.567" offset="13331686">There was no independent duty -- State law or duty to warn, no relationship between the person submitting information to FDA.</text>

            <text syncTime="3321.327" offset="13390723">Here State law is regulating the relationship between the manufacturer and -- and the patient through the doctor, and that's a traditional area of State regulation, duty to warn, and, Justice Kagan, I think you're right, the question then is whether there is an affirmative defense of -- of preemption, and the preemption comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.039" offset="13465537">It's very different from Buckman in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.257" offset="13474419">It's up to the defendant to prove, it's not an element of the cause of action as in Buckman.</text>

            <text syncTime="3399.760" offset="13704505">Mr. Kneedler has basically postulated a situation where we're going to have jury trials about whether a Federal duty to the FDA was breached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.135" offset="13741913">And it's interesting, he says that this isn't Buckman, but of course, Buckman involved the same duty not to sell a dangerous product, and the same issue of lack of disclosure to the FDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.508" offset="13783500">Now, he says it was a collateral attack, but actually that was the premise of Justice Stevens' concurrence, where Justice Stevens said I get to the same result for a different reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="3473.542" offset="13999585">Justice Sotomayor, respectfully, what's wrong with the premises, if they're claiming failure to warn, it's a very simple case of impossibility preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.366" offset="14038873">We couldn't warn, and the government's brief makes clear we had no ability to warn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.552" offset="14059666">What the government is now doing is it's taking a regulation, 201.57, which doesn't say the word "ask" in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.674" offset="14088088">It actually says "revise".</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.860" offset="14096865">And it says revise because it's a regulation written for brand manufacturers that have the CBE option available to them, and they are then trying to incorporate the words "duty to ask" through this brief without, as Justice Alito says, taking into any account through notice and comment rulemaking the effect of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.171" offset="14178053">Well, we know that there are over 1,600 requests for labeling revisions pending at the FDA now, 650 of them are pending for more than 6 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.712" offset="14216296">And at the relevant time of this case, Your Honor, not only would we have had to ask the FDA, but then the FDA would have had to negotiate with the brand, because prior to the FDAAA amendments, the FDA couldn't order a brand to change, so we would have had to make the request, the FDA would have had to negotiate the brand change, and then we would have had to follow.</text>
