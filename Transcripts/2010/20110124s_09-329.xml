            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Regulation Z, promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to its authority under the Truth in Lending Act, requires issuers of credit cards to disclose certain information to cardholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.817" offset="164718">The version of Regulation Z, applicable in this case, requires that insurers provide cardholders with an “initial disclosure statement”, specifying “each periodic rate” associated with the account.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.551" offset="239637">The regulation also imposes “subsequent disclosure requirements” including giving to cardholders notice when any term required to be initially disclosed is changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.672" offset="300136">The cardholder agreement between petitioner, Chase Bank and respondent James McCoy, authorized Chase to raise McCoy's interest rate up to a preset maximum, in the event that McCoy was delinquent or in default.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.447" offset="367219">This case presents the question, whether Regulation Z required Chase to notify McCoy of an increase it imposed within the range specified in the agreement following such delinquency or default.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.886" offset="428972">We conclude that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.743" offset="440362">We find that the text of Regulation Z is ambiguous with respect to the key question, whether an interest rate increase instituted pursue -- pursuant to a previously disclosed contractual provision is a change in term requiring notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.790" offset="516535">Because the regular -- regulatory text is unclear, we look to the Board's own interpretation of the regulation for guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.878" offset="552897">Under our precedent in Auer versus Robbins, we deferred to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations advanced in a legal brief, unless that interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.259" offset="622488">In its amicus brief to this Court, the Board states that in its view, the version of Regulation Z, applicable in this case, does not require notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.290" offset="666582">The interest rate increase at issue did not change the term of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.885" offset="688943">It's simply implemented a term previously disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.394" offset="707020">This interpretation is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the regulation, and we have no reason to suspect that it does not reflect the Board's fair and considered judgment on the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.594" offset="759787">Accordingly, this interpretation is authoritative under Auer and we need look no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.282" offset="786536">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed.</text>
