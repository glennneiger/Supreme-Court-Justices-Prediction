            <text syncTime="13.408" offset="159075">In Nguyen, the Court approved the imposition of legitimation requirement only upon fathers of non-marital children born abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.413" offset="191049">That was based on biological differences between men and women.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.531" offset="203588">It provided proof of parentage and proof of an opportunity to make a relationship with the child that adhered in birth as to the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.702" offset="232218">But here, the residential requirements that are at issue here have no biological basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.937" offset="253116">They set up barriers to the transmission of citizenship by younger fathers, but not younger mothers, and they are based upon gender stereotypes that women, not men, would care -- would care for non-marital children.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.645" offset="300032">That scheme has been -- the Solicitor General has attempted to justify that scheme by claiming that Congress was concerned about statelessness, but the record doesn't support that claim.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="91.074" offset="469723">In all cases, it is true in general, but there are people who don't fit the mold.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.145" offset="493965">So a stereotype is true for maybe the majority of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.232" offset="526357">It just means that you say: This is the way women are, this is the way men are.</text>

            <text syncTime="114.439" offset="563137">The -- at congressional hearings, it was said that the woman is the sole legal parent of this child, totally excluding the man, which basically dates back to the notion of coverture where men were completely out of the picture and women were the ones who were responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.949" offset="625204">So in addition to the fact that -- the empirical portion of it, there is also just the notion that the legal parent was the woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.120" offset="653939">And that was specifically--</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="138.222" offset="658328">Wasn't that said in relation to the principle that only -- that where paternity was not established, the child would be regarded as having the citizenship of the mother under the law of virtually every country, if not every country, at that time?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_f_hubachek" startTime="154.664" stopTime="201.728">
            <label>Mr. Steven F. Hubachek</label>
            <text syncTime="154.664" offset="724052">--Well, the law of many countries was that citizenship did go through the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.385" offset="751010">But with respect to legitimation and this statute, Congress drew a distinction between all -- all parents of -- excuse me, all fathers of non-marital children and those who are legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.561" offset="799702">This statute applies only to those who are legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.795" offset="808584">The very Law Review article that Congress relied upon, according to the Solicitor General, says that in the case of legitimation, citizenship goes through the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.951" offset="845260">So the bottom line is that the very -- the very article they relied upon said that in one instance it goes through the mother, but in the instance of the people who are actually affected through this statute, those who legitimate, it goes through the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.093" offset="897818">And there are also a number of situations under which mothers--</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="201.728" offset="912342">Until there is legitimation, it goes through the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.997" offset="921433">It went through the mother under the law in virtually every country, right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven F. Hubachek</label>
            <text syncTime="207.949" offset="937211">--I respectfully disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.515" offset="943480">At the time, in 1940, when this statute was passed, there were a number of situations where it wouldn't go through the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.150" offset="966050">In China and Japan, if the father was merely known it would not go through the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.804" offset="984649">There were three dozen countries at this time, including the English countries and those who followed its law, in which if their female citizen gave birth to a child somewhere other than in their country, citizenship would not travel through that mother because of the laws of those particular countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.198" offset="1058210">There are also stateless women.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.534" offset="1063539">So in all those situations, the citizenship would not go through the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.169" offset="1082138">It would have to go through the father, and this statutory scheme doesn't in any way provide for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.306" offset="1098648">The scheme also creates severe risks of statelessness, as is set out in the Statelessness Scholar's brief, for married fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.494" offset="1127382">If a married father who is married to an alien, the -- in those situations, there are a number of countries that would not allow the woman to transmit citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.064" offset="1157684">So if the father was precluded by laws such as they were in the United States, that child would end up stateless as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.752" offset="1180463">So there is substantial risk of statelessness and it continues today.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.103" offset="1193838">There are numerous countries that have basically reinstituted that rule, that if the father is merely known, citizenship would not transmit through the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.542" offset="1231559">And those are primarily in the Middle East and some of them in Africa, and those are detailed in the Statelessness Scholars' brief.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="287.363" offset="1254860">Mr. Hubachek, how do you deal with the argument that, really, this is a classification where the unmarried woman is being favored, because the unmarried father is being bracketed with the married couple?</text>
            <text syncTime="305.677" offset="1328107">So it's kind of like Matthews v. Heckler: The woman is getting a special favor and the unwed father is treated like most people who married -- couples who have children.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_f_hubachek" startTime="323.638" stopTime="351.139">
            <label>Mr. Steven F. Hubachek</label>
            <text syncTime="323.638" offset="1399996">This is not a case where Congress was seeking to remedy any sort of past discrimination against women, as was the case, say, in Schlesinger v. Ballard.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.058" offset="1433642">There was no discrimination against women.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.594" offset="1443777">Up until very shortly before this statute was passed, it was clear under the State Department practices that the non-marital children of women did get women's citizenship, and it was also true as to men.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.004" offset="1493410">So there was no discrimination that was being remedied in that situation.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="351.139" offset="1510024">But that doesn't answer, I don't think, Justice Ginsberg's question, which is: This appears to be an exception to a generalized non-gender based requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.881" offset="1564985">Couples, male or female, and fathers, unmarried fathers, are subject to five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.619" offset="1591944">Only unmarried mothers get the largesse of one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.523" offset="1611483">Why isn't -- why shouldn't everybody just be put to the broader category rather than extending a largesse to a greater number of people?</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven F. Hubachek</label>
            <text syncTime="389.081" offset="1661743">The reason is, Justice Sotomayor, is that we are not talking about an exception here, the treatment that the non-marital mothers were getting.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.000" offset="1689433">That was the standard prior to the 1940 litigation -- 1940 legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.471" offset="1707301">There was no significance residence requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.737" offset="1716391">Then Congress imposed new residence requirements because it was concerned about the foreign influence in mixed marriages, meaning someone who was married to an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.362" offset="1754843">In those situations, Congress specifically said in the record that they were concerned that when those children were born abroad, that they would have foreign influence, that they would be more foreign then they were American.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.401" offset="1795072">That's not--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="423.235" offset="1798311">So doesn't the 5-year residency requirement address that?</text>
            <text syncTime="428.203" offset="1818269">If we apply it generally, wouldn't the 5-year residency requirement honor Congress's concern about there being a substantial tie to the States?</text>

            <text syncTime="439.077" offset="1861736">--Absolutely, it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.927" offset="1865080">And that -- for -- that concern is not applicable when you are talking about two U.S. citizen parents to whom the extended residence requirement didn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.016" offset="1897472">Non-marital mothers were assumed to be the ones who were going to be raising the children without the influence of an alien father.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.420" offset="1923072">The non-marital fathers are in the same category as those, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.722" offset="1940313">Those non-marital fathers who raise their children on their own, as Petitioner's father did in this case, are not subject to that type of foreign influence, so they should be grouped together with the women and with the two-citizen families, because they have the lack of foreign influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.565" offset="1999663">So it's only as to the mixed-marriage couples who are married where there is a foreign influence problem, and they're the ones to whom the expanded residence required -- was applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.921" offset="2041145">Now, with respect to the -- the Solicitor General has raised concerns about the plenary power doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.293" offset="2078553">And I would argue that that doesn't apply here for a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.911" offset="2093077">First is, we are not talking about the admission of aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.132" offset="2105929">Second is that the Court in Chadha Zadvydas said -- made clear that even when exercising that power, that congressional -- excuse me -- Congress's power is limited by constitutional limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.206" offset="2158279">Now, with respect to the entry of aliens, Congress made it very clear in passing this very statute that they considered those people who gained citizenship as of birth to be differently situated than aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.181" offset="2206135">That was a tradition that dated back to 1350.</text>

            <text syncTime="1102.348" offset="4514837">And my point is that structurally, that remedy is unavailable here, because you can't take away the citizenship from the people who have already gotten it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.937" offset="4545139">And the notion that you can grant us prospective relief as discussed in the Solicitor General's brief doesn't make any sense, either, because number one, this statute, the one we are talking about today, doesn't apply past people who were born before 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.697" offset="4604176">But the thing is that if somebody were to come into court after an opinion that said just that were issued -- someone were to come into court and say, I want to claim citizenship through my mother, that person would still be entitled to citizenship because it's as of the day of birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.140" offset="4665929">So this is a retroactive provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.159" offset="4674079">So the prospective relief notion really doesn't makes any sense in this context, because the equal protection violations have basically all already occurred at the time that the person who would make a citizenship claim was born, and we would still be left in a situation where Petitioner's father would say that I was unable to transmit citizenship to my son and a woman who was similarly situated was able to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.488" offset="4763418">So that type of remedy is unavailable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2024.074" offset="8201759">As I mentioned, there are a number of factors that Congress takes into account in crafting a statute like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.828" offset="8220776">1401 deals with married couples and where both parents are citizens, all that is required is that one of the parents have resided in the United States prior to the birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.735" offset="8268319">Where you have mixed parentage, the background of the enactment of this in 1940 and reenactment in 1952 and continued up to this present day is Congress was concerned that such a child may not have the requisite connection to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.328" offset="8330700">They have a connection to the parent, but may not have a connection to the United States such that Congress wanted to grant citizenship to that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.582" offset="8355777">So what Congress did in the mixed citizenship situation was to require prior residency of the parent as a talisman, as the Court said in Rogers v. Bellei, for a connection to the United States of ten years, five years after the age of 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.492" offset="8411366">Congress has liberalized that, but that was the basic thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.526" offset="8423487">Where you have unwed parents, in 1409(a) what Congress did was to follow general principles of the law of illegitimacy or children born out of wedlock, if a father legitimates a child then it's as if the child was born in a marriage, and the rule in 1401 with respect to marriage applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.094" offset="8533828">That is true whether both parents are citizens or in a mixed marriage situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.765" offset="8556502">If a father legitimates a child and both parents are citizens, then not the one, then the child benefits from the rule that if either parent was present in the United States before birth he's a citizen, doesn't have to satisfy the one year unbroken residency requirement under 1409(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.495" offset="8639363">If it's mixed parentage, and the father legitimates, then the rule applicable to married mixed citizen and parents applies as if the child had been married at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.688" offset="8700176">It's a perfectly sensible and provision or approach and consistent with the way this has been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.758" offset="8728492">What Congress did with respect to the mother of the child born out of wedlock where there has not have been legitimation is to confer citizenship on the basis of a one year residency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.184" offset="8786171">Now, as counsel for the Petitioner explains, a mother in that situation who at the moment of birth, as this Court understood in Nguyen, that mother may be the only either legal parent or the only parent at the moment of birth with the requisite connection to the child to have an opportunity for this sort of connection at birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.098" offset="8865792">So the mother in that circumstance is very much like the two citizen parent family, the only parents are parents with a connection to the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2849.863" offset="11504891">And one of the members of the Court said, this is discrimination against the child, even though the classification was -- it's called a mother's benefit -- it's discrimination against the child because it should make no difference at all whether the missing parent is female or male, that that was utterly irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.347" offset="11610843">That was the Chief -- that was then Justice Rehnquist's concurring opinion in Wiesenfeld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.351" offset="11634876">So he seemed to think that the discrimination was against the child and that that counted for equal protection purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3399.088" offset="13701789">The rationale that the Solicitor General's office offers today is that further assumptions can be made that even after men do the things that the Court said were legitimately required of them, that they legitimate, that they have an opportunity to form a relationship with their child, that further gender-based assumptions should be put into place and say that, well, but you are not going to be the real father or you're not going to be the real parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.071" offset="13813697">Whereas in the case of women we are going to assume that when they had have the nonmarital child they are going to be in charge and that when a father legitimates and does whatever is required wherever the child is born, we are going to assume that the mother is involved still.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.181" offset="13870122">But the very facts of this case demonstrate that that's not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.450" offset="13883183">That in this case Petitioner's father raised him and Petitioner's mother was not involved in his growing up and he brought him to the United States -- I'm sorry, if I was getting a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.424" offset="13931144">So it's basically piling further gender-related inferences on top of the ones that are already in place in order to serve to justify this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.379" offset="13970954">Now, with respect to the Fiallo case, there is a tradition of allowing citizens to transmit citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.283" offset="14002510">Fiallo involved getting aliens into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.668" offset="14016094">There is no tradition that dates back to 1350 where citizens enjoyed rights to bring aliens into the United States, but it does date back to 1350 that you've been able to confer citizenship on your foreign-born children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.328" offset="14066772">So it is differently situated and it is differently situated in the very structure of the statute that we are talking about today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.749" offset="14092372">Congress very specifically eliminated the ability of courts to change the rules of naturalization of aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.219" offset="14118285">It basically used language very similar to the courts decision in Ginsberg and said that you can be naturalized under this provision and no other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.956" offset="14149214">It didn't say that as to citizens as of birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.991" offset="14161335">Citizens as of birth are treated differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.127" offset="14169903">There is a severability clause in the statute, so that would apply to them and that brings into play all the various remedies that the Court has granted with the respect to extension over the years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3534.568" offset="14243673">I agree that the Constitution doesn't guarantee that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.687" offset="14256212">Our point is that it's a traditional right and that Congress has always provided for it even in the period between 1802 and 1855 where the statute was strangely drafted and didn't provide for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.376" offset="14298948">This Court made clear in Montana v. Kennedy that when Congress remedied that situation it made that remedy retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.213" offset="14326324">So basically we have an unbroken tradition dating back to 1350, that's why I think that this right should be treated differently than the questions of admissions of aliens in Fiallo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.902" offset="14369061">And, again, there is also Chadha Zadvydas that made clear that the Constitution limits the Congress's power even in the context of naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.405" offset="14403020">And then with respect to the third-party standing issue, the Court has granted third-party standing to criminal defendants whose are raising third-party constitutional issues in their criminal cases, and the same analysis should apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.815" offset="14452652">We can still look at the right from the perspective of the Petitioner's father and if the Court grants a levelling down remedy, that would not remedy the situation the Petitioner's father would be in because both before and after the Court's decision the children of women, similarly situated women, would be citizens and Petitioner's father's son would not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3616.250" offset="14570412">Those are both cases where the criminal defendant asserted rights of -- in one case it's a petit juror and another in the other case it was a grand juror, and there were discriminatory preemptory challenges in those cases, and the court allowed those criminal defendants to assert those constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.646" offset="14648048">Several members of the court also found there was standing in Miller.</text>
