            <text syncTime="44.779" offset="284568">This is the most natural reading of the statute, and words matter.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen C. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="126.581" offset="611725">--Because the purpose of the Armed Career Criminal Act is not to enhance a sentence because of the prior conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.650" offset="640042">It is because the Federal firearm offense at the time it was committed is more serious based on -- based on its repetitive nature, as this Court has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.923" offset="677136">So therefore looking to, when the defendant commits the offense, what his status is at that time under the law we think makes sense and is consonant with the purpose of what ACCA is trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.183" offset="730112">ACCA is not trying to punish the State offense at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.135" offset="745994">And of course the converse, Your Honor, is that by adopting the government's reading, is individuals who at a time committed an offense when a State at that time viewed an offense as more serious but now has changed its view of the offense, does not view it as being as serious, that person also would receive a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="190.689" offset="868143">Mr. Gordon, the State does regard it -- it does -- prescribe 10 years for this defendant because it's made a -- made the change not retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.061" offset="913701">So a maximum of 10 years is prescribed for Mr. McNeill, and all others who committed the offense prior to the change in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.185" offset="962184">So it is -- it is the State's current position that for this defendant the maximum is 10 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.124" offset="993949">Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.826" offset="1008682">Where we fundamentally disagree with the government and with the Fourth Circuit is on the significance of retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.563" offset="1035640">We -- the statute requires -- or the statute directs us to look at the penalty that is prescribed for the offense, the offense in its generic context.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.870" offset="1080884">It -- it is not about what the circumstances of the defendant were that produced the particular conviction for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.941" offset="1109201">No one who commits the trafficking offenses that Mr. McNeill committed today is going to be facing a 10-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.582" offset="1151728">It's not going to happen to anyone who commits the offense from today forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.403" offset="1171059">And we think that is where the statute directs us to look: What is the penalty for the generic offense?</text>

            <text syncTime="273.307" offset="1198644">Suppose -- what would happen in this situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="276.342" offset="1210765">A defendant is convicted under a State statute that says that anybody who sells between 1 ounces -- 1 ounce and 5 ounces of a particular controlled substance is guilty of a felony and may be punished by imprisonment for a certain amount of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.172" offset="1290073">And then the State repeals that provision altogether and enacts a new provision that says anybody who sells between 1 ounces -- 1 ounce and 8 ounces is punishable by a certain penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.230" offset="1346288">And now the question comes up what -- what penalty does the court look at with respect to the earlier offense that no longer exists for which the defendant was convicted?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_c_gordon" startTime="321.888" stopTime="380.909">
            <label>Mr. Stephen C. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="321.888" offset="1392995">There -- there are two possible answers, Justice Alito.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.524" offset="1407519">First, the court could look to what the offense is now, could look back to what the defendant did consistent with Shepard and so forth, and see if the defendant's conviction contains the element of the -- the elements that apply to the present offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.569" offset="1487663">If the court could not do that, then the conviction would count for purposes of the defendant's criminal history.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.009" offset="1517443">It would not count as an ACCA predicate, and the district court would then be limited to a 10-year sentence as opposed to a 15-to-life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.048" offset="1557567">So consistent with -- with its purpose, we think that the statute should be read as speaking to the time, not of the State conviction -- not of the State sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="382.961" offset="1637292">--Mr. Gordon, is this -- is this essentially an academic question?</text>
            <text syncTime="388.513" offset="1659444">Because this district judge said that he would impose the same sentence as a variant even if he couldn't do it under the guidelines, even if it were an incorrect calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.506" offset="1719421">He said: This criminal record is violent and astonishing; essentially, I'm going to throw the book at him, and I'm going to do it through a variant if that's no -- if there's no other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.432" offset="1775114">So isn't that -- I mean, isn't this an -- an exercise, essentially an academic exercise, if -- if your -- your client would end up in the same place?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_c_gordon" startTime="430.358" stopTime="507.108">
            <label>Mr. Stephen C. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="430.358" offset="1826837">Well, Justice Ginsburg, it may be an academic exercise for Mr. McNeill or for the Mr. McNeills of the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.798" offset="1864662">The judge would -- if this Court were to agree with us, the judge could impose consecutive sentences on a remand and still achieve the same sentence, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.021" offset="1909488">For someone whose only offense, however, is a 922(g) conviction, then it makes a huge difference because, rather than looking at a 15-year mandatory minimum penalty, the defendant would be looking at no more than 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.781" offset="1972496">So, the judge's -- it would be significantly cabined in -- in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.435" offset="1995170">And the other, with respect to the Mr. McNeills of the world, the judge on a remand is still going to be required to calculate the guidelines correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.694" offset="2052221">And so if the guidelines change, if they go down in this case, for the judge to achieve a 300-month sentence, the judge is going to have to state reasons again and arguably more significant reasons to -- to achieve that same level if he's working from a lower guideline range.</text>

            <text syncTime="1445.609" offset="5887833">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.811" offset="5896714">Petitioner was convicted under North Carolina law of multiple offenses subject to a 10-year maximum term of imprisonment, and he actually received 10-year sentences for his drug crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.119" offset="5937883">He now claims that those convictions are not ones for which the maximum term of imprisonment is at least 10 years for purposes of ACCA's definition of serious drug offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.142" offset="5974037">That result is incorrect, because the sentencing court should consider the offense and the punishment as they were defined by the body of law under which the defendant was convicted and sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.248" offset="6018445">This is the simplest approach, because the Court is already looking to the statute at the time of the underlying conviction in order to evaluate whether it satisfies the substantive component of the definition of a serious drug offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.090" offset="6069750">And if I can start where Justice Sotomayor finished with my friend, we have one footnote in the first part of our argument, footnote 5, which clarifies an issue that isn't at stake here, which is that when we say that you need to look to the time of the underlying conviction, that that includes the time of the sentencing which could include some sentence modification proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.123" offset="6161910">If the State had amended the law in the meantime, made it retroactively applicable and the defendant were able to get his judgment or conviction modified, then we would not insist that -- that he still had an offense that was subject to a 10-year maximum term of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.548" offset="6227634">And we think that this approach is consistent with what the Court said in Rodriguez, where it was also evaluating the serious drug offense under ACCA and pointed us to the documents associated with the judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.940" offset="6277162">It recognizes that the relevant question here is the body of law that applied to this particular defendant in his offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.962" offset="6305270">And -- and it's the term "conviction" that actually points us to that in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.681" offset="6324182">The question is what is the sentencing regime associated with the defendant's actual conviction, and the government's--</text>

            <text syncTime="1721.939" offset="6993126">The district judge adopted this argument in response to Petitioner's objection to the PSR which had taken this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.343" offset="7022801">In the court of appeals, Petitioner relied upon the Sixth Circuit's decision in Morton, and we -- we responded the essentially the way the Fourth Circuit did, which is to say the Fifth Circuit has distinguished instances like that when the court has not -- when the State has not made the -- the intervening decrease in the sentence retroactively applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.089" offset="7105766">That's the interpretation that the Fourth Circuit adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.041" offset="7113603">But the government has made this argument before in -- in the Second Circuit in Darden, in the Fifth Circuit in Hinojosa, in the -- in the Sixth Circuit in Morton in the 1994 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.849" offset="7160832">The government has made this lead argument that we're making today in addition to the fallback argument that the -- that the Fourth Circuit adopted here, and that the Fifth Circuit adopted in -- in Hinojosa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.491" offset="7203359">But I would note that the lead argument that we're making today has several advantages that make it preferable to the fallback argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.346" offset="7238781">Some of them have already been brought up today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.396" offset="7247036">I already mentioned the fact that this is simpler, because it requires the judge to just look to one time to evaluate the substantive component of the definition and the -- the sentence component of the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.420" offset="7295101">But this also prevents the types of problems that Justice Alito addressed earlier that may arise when the State has amended the definition of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.074" offset="7329688">If you just look to the -- the actual offense at the time of the conviction, then you don't run into those sorts of problems, and the Fifth Circuit recognized this in its Allen decision and therefore ended up having to adopt what is essentially the government's lead argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.201" offset="7394262">The Sixth Circuit which generally follows Petitioner's rule also ended up adopting the government's lead argument in the context of a guidelines determination, because it recognized that it -- it was unwilling to assume that a conviction simply disappears when the State has modified the definitions in such a way that you can't precisely translate into current terms what the underlying offense of conviction is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.269" offset="7498543">The government's reading avoids that problem because it doesn't require you to recharacterize the old offense at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.340" offset="7522785">It just says what was he convicted of?</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.542" offset="7531562">What was the maximum sentence associated with that offense at the time he was actually prosecuted?</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.493" offset="7551415">There's nothing hypothetical about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.612" offset="7559879">And as the -- as the Court pointed out in Rodriguez, we would expect a lot of the documents association with a judgment of conviction to make this a relatively easy inquiry to answer what was the maximum sentence at the relevant time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.420" offset="7607108">This -- the reading also avoids the difficulty that Justice Sotomayor pointed out that -- that is associated with later increases in -- in the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.859" offset="7648904">Under the government's view, if you committed an offense at a time when it was subject to a 10-year punishment, Congress has reasonably assumed that you are a dangerous person; but that Congress could also reasonably assume that there's a distinction between somebody who commits an offense at a time when it's subject to a 10-year term of imprisonment and someone else who commits that offense at a different time when it's subject to only a 30-month term of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.426" offset="7751095">And so under North Carolina law, for instance, the -- the felony of manufacture of methamphetamine went from being a class H felony which is subject to a 30-year maximum term of imprisonment to being a class C felony -- excuse me, a 30-month maximum term of imprisonment, to a class C felony, which is subject to a 19-year maximum term of imprisonment on December 1st, 2004.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.542" offset="7843568">And we think it's reasonable for Congress to assume that somebody who committed the crime of manufacturing methamphetamine in North Carolina at a time when it was subject to a 30-month maximum sentence is not as dangerous as somebody who was willing to commit the same offense at a time when it was subject to a 19-year maximum term of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.586" offset="7911800">And the government's approach by -- by requiring the court to look to the time of the underlying conviction and sentencing unifies the inquiry across both components of the definition of serious drug offense and the definition of violent felony that Justice Kagan alluded to in the earlier part of the argument, that the definition of violent felony includes present-tense references to whether a crime is burglary, the question of whether it is punishable by a -- by a term exceeding 12 months, which is necessary to establish that it's a felony is one that -- that we believe needs to be made at the time of the underlying conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2008.007" offset="8137498">So why should the prior judgment about the severity of the offense be taken into account under ACCA?</text>

            <text syncTime="2023.182" offset="8198102">And if -- if the State actually thinks that the previous offenses that were committed were less serious, then it could make the decreased maximum term of imprisonment retroactively applicable if -- if it wanted to demonstrate that -- that it really thought that those were mistakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.061" offset="8269678">But that's not the approach that South Carolina has taken -- that North Carolina has taken here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2177.933" offset="8817204">It would be an expansion of what we proposed in footnote 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.254" offset="8834445">We think that the relevant inquiry starts with the conviction, but if -- if the court were to ask in the context of the body of law that applies to his offensive conviction, whether the State has changed its mind by doing -- by altering the precise yardstick that Congress has directed the court to look to, then -- then I think that -- that that would be an appropriate way to deal with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.952" offset="8933188">I'm not exactly sure how you get it out of the words of the statute, but it -- it would solve the problem for -- for cases like this of somebody who had been unable to take advantage of a sentence modification type of proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2235.250" offset="9046455">Several States have specific saving statutes like the Federal Government does in 1 U.S.C. 109.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.023" offset="9077488">At least three States have constitutional provisions that effectively are something like a saving statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.094" offset="9101834">Sometimes they have background common law principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.129" offset="9117926">In any instance, these types of general provisions, except where the constitutional provisions exist, could be overcome by the State legislature in a particular statute, just as is the case with the Federal savings statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.805" offset="9172679">A State legislature, if it wants to be express about the retroactive applicability of a change, would be able to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.125" offset="9201936">There may be limitations under the ex post facto clause of its increasing the severity of punishment, but for something like a decrease, there -- there would be fewer limitations.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen C. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="2293.955" offset="9281243">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.324" offset="9294723">First, the government talks about, again, the problems arising if -- if a statute is amended, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.298" offset="9338608">Again, I would like to analogize that to the violent felony prong of ACCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.619" offset="9371941">Predicate convictions disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.106" offset="9385838">Things that were predicate convictions cease to be when this Court interprets a particular offense as not qualifying as a violent felony, then -- then individuals who had committed that offense it disappears as -- as a predicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.882" offset="9448950">So it is -- it is not anomalous for that to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.667" offset="9464101">The government speaks about looking to the time of the State proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.209" offset="9506210">It is -- that -- that -- that approach overlooks that changes to drug laws very well could reflect a normative judgment on the basis of the -- of the legislature, and the question is whether -- whether in the way it wrote the statute, Congress wanted -- wanted to defer to those State judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.026" offset="9617492">Texas and New York changed their sentencing laws because they judged them to have been too harsh, that -- that they treated as more serious offenses than -- than those offenses actually were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.488" offset="9679350">We see that today with the issue of -- of crack cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.440" offset="9699203">And under the government's reading, individuals may be hit with -- with an ACCA mandatory minimum on the basis of crack convictions sustained at a time when, you know, the view of crack is very, very different from what it is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.568" offset="9763673">So we think that is an important consideration as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.619" offset="9779869">The question of retroactivity, again, as we have argued in our brief, it does not -- the savings clause in North Carolina was a general savings clause, it applied to every single offense in the -- in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.411" offset="9831069">It was not a reflection of the -- of the legislature's judgment of seriousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.498" offset="9851444">And if I -- if I may end on a point that I made earlier, the question for this Court really is when do you want to treat two individuals -- when do you -- when do you want to look at them?</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.373" offset="9898883">Do you want to look at them at the time of the Federal offense or do you want to look at them in terms of their prior State convictions and come to a conclusion that although they did exactly the same thing in the State court, one committed a serious drug offense, one did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.917" offset="9969100">We think that is an absurd result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.286" offset="9978608">It's not a fair result, and we would ask the Court to reverse the judgment of the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.856" offset="10004835">Thank you very much.</text>
