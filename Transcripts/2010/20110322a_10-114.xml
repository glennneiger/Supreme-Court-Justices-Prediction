            <text syncTime="151.828">But the liability in this case on the constitutional claim was for, and the reason it was found to be frivolous, was that he was seeking liability on a constitutional claim for being deprived of his right to run for office when in fact he won the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.737">The intentional infliction of emotional distress, the reputational harm was far greater.</text>

            <text syncTime="177.680">This case is brought in State court, it's removed to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.699">Ultimately the plaintiff says: I recognize that as a matter of law my 1983 claim is no good.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.272">But the plaintiff didn't say that until 18 months after the -- the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.475">So doesn't the plaintiff have some responsibility for running up all these costs in the Federal -- burdening the Federal court, having discovery in Federal court, instead of saying when defendant removed the case -- either dropping the Federal claim or conceding at that point that it had no merit so it's only the State claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.937">I mean, doesn't -- doesn't the plaintiff bear responsibility for keeping that case in Federal court for 18 months?</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Joshua Rosenkranz</label>
            <text syncTime="239.335">The answer is partial responsibility, yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.095">But let's -- and I think Your Honor is correct to be looking at the burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.483">The burdens of the discovery were all the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.575">It was the same nucleus of operative facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.888">Now, if this was indeed frivolous from inception, the defendants could easily have filed a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.853">It should have taken no time at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.316">And if there was incremental increase in discovery with respect to the Federal claims, then the defendants have only themselves to blame for not having moved to dismiss early on.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.481">I think the answer would be yes, they would be entitled at least to those incremental increases in the burden, but if -- if they're doing discovery on both cases, they can't say: Oh, well this is the -- all of the discovery was Federal discovery, none of it was State discovery, when they were on the same facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="529.134">First is, if the defendants see a complaint, a 1983 theory, that is flawed at the inception, they have no business incurring costs with respect to color of State law or policymaker or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1104.773">When it comes to the defendants, though, the general litigation costs could easily or almost certainly were incurred in connection with the overall defense, and so it makes perfect sense to say to them, break out the pieces, the documents that were really just about the Federal lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2523.739">But I think there's a more fundamental point, Your Honor, which is the District Court, in awarding fees, found there was no whiff of State law claims until the very -- very much the 11th hour in this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.925">And this is precisely why, Justice Sotomayor, back to your question, we really need district courts to have discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2681.633">Usually, you will push these claims simultaneously, Federal claims and State claims simultaneously, and so there will be a lot of things that are -- that go in both directions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2710.057">And then at the last second, there is, oh, we have State law claims; let's go back to State court and litigate those.</text>

            <text syncTime="2822.237">But the District Court has a series of options.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.579">First of all, if the cases -- if the claims are going back to State court, the party does have to file the motion for attorney's fees under rule 54.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.810">You have -- you have to go in and say, if you're -- if there's a judgment being entered, we want our fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2843.847">So the District Court has lots of options.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.894">But where -- particularly where the plaintiff desires to go back to State court and the Federal case is coming to an end, the District Court must have the discretion to enter a fee award at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.467">And in fact, that has been the case, and it's specifically mentioned in the House report to section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.948">The interim fee awards, where there's an order that disposes of substantial rights, are permitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3195.617">It goes on to say, the record reflects that throughout the litigation the focus of both plaintiff and defendant was plaintiff's section 1983 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.615">And if you look at the -- the correspondence between the parties, the summary judgment papers, it is 1983 from start to finish, until -- well, until the 11th hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.589">And in fact there's even a specific statement in which the city, in an abundance of caution says, just to be clear, there are no State law claims here; and I think the district court is within its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.262">I would point the Court to the cases in which this Court has examined the standard of review for rule 11 decisions, and the Court has held in Cooter &amp; Gell and in Pierce that we give district courts very, very wide berth on these questions, precisely because they're on the ground, they recognize what the -- what the standards are for pleading who is going to be on notice as to what, and this is a funny case in that regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3339.861">I actually like Mr. Stancil's cake metaphor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.120">What matters is not how big -- how much of the cake was devoted to one claim versus another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.784">What matters is how much more energy it takes to bake this particular sliver of the cake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.416">It is all the same energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.462">The central piece of Mr. Stancil's argument is that the district court found that the focus was only on the Federal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.906">That is a misreading of that one sentence, and Mr. Stancil keeps eliding the one critical word of that sentence, which was the district court said that they were not on notice that they needed to separately defend the State law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.998">Our whole point is they did not need to separately defend the State law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.404">The district court was all turned around about the need to do something separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.209">And the reason we can be sure that Justice Sotomayor's reading of the complaint is the same as everyone else's is because the lawyers in this case, the defense counsel, did realize that there were State law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.617">Their answers are rife with State law defenses, and I refer the Court to pages 50, 56, and 66 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.691">Each one of them has three separate reference to -- references to, if we are found liable under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.542">The summary judgment motion to which Mr. Stancil refers has a response, an opposition by the -- by the defendants, in which they caption -- this is on page 122B -- the caption is</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.597">"State Law Claims Against the Town of Vinton. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3557.620">I assume most district courts, when they get it, they're going to start by looking at whatever his affidavit, this is how much our fees were, and then if there's some reason, perhaps Mr. Stancil's case, where everybody thinks it's a Federal that's all, or maybe not, then they can just go "fairly attributable" rather than but-for, which gives the district court a lot more leeway and the sort of leeway we have always held in this area they should have.</text>
