            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-10876, Bullcoming v. New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.654" offset="133036">Mr. Fisher.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="7.637" offset="137007">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.856" offset="149859">The text, purpose, and history of the Confrontation Clause make it clear that the prosecution cannot introduce one person's testimonial statements through the in-court testimony of someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.080" offset="194790">Thus, having held in Melendez-Diaz that a lab analyst's statements in a forensic lab report are testimonial, this is an easy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.435" offset="228227">The State violated the Confrontation Clause by introducing lab analyst Curtis Caylor's statements in a forensic lab report without putting him on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.589" offset="260827">The New Mexico Supreme Court resisted this analysis, straightforward as it is, on the ground that Mr. Bullcoming, as the defendant, had the opportunity to cross-examine a substitute or a surrogate witness, Mr. Razatos.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.063" offset="318715">But a surrogate witness procedure violates all four components of the right to confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.051" offset="338672">It quite obviously violates the defendant's right to have the witness testify in his presence, in the presence of the jury so the jury can observe it, and under oath, as happened in this case.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="68.441" offset="380259">Mr. Fisher, when you say "in the presence", do you -- do you mean it necessarily must be in the courtroom, or would a video-conferencing set-up be permissible so that the technician or the analyst could testify from the lab, rather -- but it would be screened in -- in the courthouse?</text>

            <text syncTime="89.522" offset="464583">Well, the default rule under the Confrontation Clause is in presence, in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.390" offset="484018">Now, in Maryland v. Craig, this Court held in a child witness setting -- of course, very different than this case -- that closed-circuit TV would be permissible, and I believe, you know, in a future case, if the State perhaps made some sort of showing that the lab analyst couldn't come to court for some reason, and certainly if the defendant stipulated, and maybe even if the defendant didn't stipulate, a court could accommodate--</text>

            <text syncTime="116.505" offset="572416">The defendant didn't give his consent, so we don't -- that's not a concern, but let's -- let's suppose defendant doesn't stipulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.593" offset="604808">Is this adequate to meet the Confrontation Clause?</text>

            <text syncTime="137.919" offset="658098">Now -- now, there is an amicus brief in the case, I believe, that suggests some flexibility that trial judges might employ in -- in accommodating lab analysts' schedules.</text>

            <text syncTime="1269.791" offset="5185640">Let me -- if I give you two hypotheticals, maybe it explains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.174" offset="5195149">On the one hand, I don't think anyone would claim that a time stamp on a fax machine, for example, is a human statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.480" offset="5224406">It's a machine statement, and so therefore it can't be testimonial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.115" offset="5234855">On the other hand, if someone types out an affidavit on a word processor and hits print, you can't say, well, that's the machine talking, not the human.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.102" offset="5266829">So the question arises in the lab context whether a.21 or anything else that comes out of the machine has enough human influence that it ought to be treated as the -- as the person's statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.243" offset="5311446">Now, you don't have to resolve that in this case, and what's important to emphasize is that that hypothetical of the.21, even though the State would like it to be this case, is really miles away for the reason you said, because the State proved a lot more than.21 by Mr. Caylor's lab report, and that's why these hypotheticals I think are important.</text>

            <text syncTime="1379.741" offset="5625438">But remember, he was not convicted simply of DUI; he was convicted in New Mexico law of aggravated DUI.</text>

            <text syncTime="1404.589" offset="5724808">Let me come back to the -- to the important point, I think, though, that what the State wants to be able to do -- I don't want to ascribe a bad motive, but what the State's rule would allow States to do is to insulate people from cross-examination, not just Mr. Caylor in this case, but -- but -- but please pay attention to, for example, the Dungo case that's cited in our opening brief, from California.</text>

            <text syncTime="1473.683" offset="6001183">And if I could just finish the Dungo story, in the -- in the California Court of Appeal, when they reviewed that case, they said the prosecutor's intent in that case had been to shield Mr. -- I'm sorry, the -- the actual analyst in that case from cross-examination.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="3505.114" offset="14126937">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.564" offset="14132684">Let me try to make four quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.078" offset="14138744">First, Justice Alito, I said the first objection was at JA 40, it's actually 44-45 in the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.624" offset="14164971">With regard to the State's argument about whether this document is testimonial, I would simply urge the Court to take a very close look at the lab report itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.090" offset="14198826">It's at JA 62.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.619" offset="14204886">At the top it says, Mr. Chief Justice, in response to your question, arresting officer identification, and the officer writes, check for blood alcohol concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.038" offset="14238636">That's the order to the lab.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.645" offset="14245010">If you look at the bottom in the certification of analyst, he certifies that the following is true and correct, signs his name, and perhaps the most critical thing is at the very bottom, the actual rules of the New Mexico evidence law and criminal procedure law are referenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.311" offset="14303734">So, it's exactly like Melendez-Diaz.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.984" offset="14310421">This is a document that is expressly prepared for substitute live testimony.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3556.622" offset="14332886">Not under oath, though, that's the only difference?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="3558.248" stopTime="3571.975">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="3558.248" offset="14339469">Not under oath if a certification is actually different than an oath, that just makes this worse, as in Crawford this Court said that it would be implausible that trial by affidavit would be prohibited but trial by unsworn affidavit would be okay.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3571.975" stopTime="3577.926">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="3571.975" offset="14394326">Do the rules of criminal -- do the rules of criminal procedure in New Mexico say it should be prima facie evidence?</text>

            <text syncTime="3579.489" offset="14424419">There are -- there are several rules referenced at the bottom that all make this automatically admissible, notwithstanding the hearsay rule to prove the truth of the matter asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.251" offset="14451482">With respect to Justice Ginsburg's question about retesting, you are exactly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.029" offset="14474574">The State had many choices in the case -- in this case about how to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.369" offset="14491920">But if it wanted Mr. Razatos to be its witness, all it had to do was have him do a -- retest it and write a new report and have him be the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.899" offset="14522013">There is no reason it would have to introduce Mr. Caylor's report then and come up against any State law issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.646" offset="14541030">Mr. Razatos could have been the live witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="3613.785" offset="14561614">I mean, you have the right to look at their evidence presumably so -- so far in advance of trial, whatever, and if they had to get a new -- new technician, that would have to put off the trial--</text>

            <text syncTime="3625.047" offset="14606649">I think that goes to my last point, which is, Justice Breyer, you're talking about States that do this -- I'll combine my answer to these two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.214" offset="14635280">A continuance would have been perfectly -- perfectly appropriate if that scenario had arisen, Mr. Chief Justice, and that's what -- one thing the public -- Public Defender Service brief it talks about 23 -- 26 jurisdictions encompassing 23 different States that follow the rule that we're advocating today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.647" offset="14709049">And it -- we're not asking for more witnesses.</text>
