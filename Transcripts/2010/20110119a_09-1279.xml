            <text syncTime="10.039" offset="145596">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.974" offset="157299">The court of appeals has held that FOIA's statutory protection for personal privacy in Exemption 7(C) extends beyond the privacy of individuals and protects the so-called personal privacy of corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.365" offset="206932">That holding is inconsistent with the text of Exemption 7(C), FOIA's broader context, and the statute's drafting history, and would lead to anomalous results.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.804" offset="244652">The word "personal", standing alone, refers to individual -- an individual human being.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.458" offset="267222">"Privacy", standing alone, and even more so in the context of the phrase "invasion of privacy", invokes purely individual concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.516" offset="307451">And the sum of those terms -- that is, the statutory phrase used in FOIA, "personal privacy" -- is greater than the sum of its parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.853" offset="336812">It's long been well settled that corporations have no personal privacy.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="62.840" offset="356770">Isn't it true that there are contexts in the law in which the word "personal" is used to refer to a corporation?</text>
            <text syncTime="69.827" offset="384773">For example, you could refer to personal jurisdiction over a corporation, couldn't you?</text>

            <text syncTime="74.648" offset="403999">There are -- the term "personal" is sometimes used as a term of art, and I think personal jurisdiction is one of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.802" offset="432630">It is the modern, shorter term of art for jurisdiction in personam and reflects a distinction drawn still in the law between cases brought in personam and cases brought in rem.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.311" offset="494696">That -- the evolution of that term in the law as a term of art does not reflect what the ordinary meaning of "personal" is.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.767" offset="528447">It is just the same as the term "personal property", which also invokes long-established traditional distinctions between property that could be recovered in rem or in real actions versus property that might be recovered in actions in personam.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.527" offset="591559">So -- and, in fact, I think it -- it is important to note that there are -- although maybe there are some instances that -- I think there's one instance that AT&amp;T cites in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.221" offset="654252">Nothing -- it never cited any use of the term "personal" to mean corporate or pertaining to a corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.183" offset="734187">If you're making a personal appearance, it is not something that a corporation does.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.087" offset="753727">A corporation is a -- a legal construct.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.757" offset="772430">It doesn't exist as a thing that can make an appearance.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.025" offset="785492">Well, in ordinary speech, the term "personal" is not -- the term "person" is not used to refer to a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.298" offset="818615">That's legalese.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.931" offset="825093">But in -- but since the -- the Administrative Procedure Act defines a person to include a corporation, why is it relevant here or dispositive here to look to the ordinary usage of term "personal" as opposed to the way it's -- it's used in the law?</text>
            <text syncTime="200.562" offset="907640">And in the law, it is sometimes used to refer to a corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="203.831" offset="920701">Well, I think that -- that point actually reinforces our position, because although "person" is used in certain legal contexts to refer to artificial persons and corporations and the like, "personal" is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.173" offset="974096">And "personal", as we explained in our brief, is not simply a grammatical alteration, an inflection of the term "person".</text>
            <text syncTime="226.112" offset="1009831">It has existed in its own right since the late 1300s and has developed meaning that is unique to the term "personal", which--</text>

            <text syncTime="237.718" offset="1056329">The request came in and, as I understand it, the Commission said there are two exemptions: The one for trade secrets, commercial, financial confidential information; and then there was one with Exemption 7 itself, but as to the employee.</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony A. Yang</label>
            <text syncTime="289.600" offset="1263846">Well, I -- I don't think the touchstone is necessarily embarrassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.535" offset="1279519">What the government does, following this Court's decision in Reporters Committee is tries to determine whether there is a personal privacy interest about individuals, and that is information that pertains to particular individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.695" offset="1332182">For instance, in this Court's decision in DOD v. FLRA the Court explained, although an agency released the name of individuals, it could properly withhold the addresses, the home addresses, of those individuals, even though that might be publicly available in phone books, because individuals have at least some small personal privacy interest in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.609" offset="1415879">So what the agency will do is try to identify information pertaining to individuals and then will conduct -- if there is certain information, will try to conduct a balancing to determine whether there is a public interest in disclosure, that is whether revealing this would disclose information against the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.176" offset="1526115">Well, I think the corporation to the -- in a reverse FOIA case, for instance, which what is we have here, where the corporation is alleging that the government's decisionmaking process is arbitrary and capricious, it has Article III standing to resist the disclosure of documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.672" offset="1604065">If you're using standing kind of like a Fourth Amendment concept of standing, I don't think that--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="381.076" offset="1629769">Well, as an administrative matter, can the corporation make a FOIA objection on behalf of its employees.</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony A. Yang</label>
            <text syncTime="386.647" offset="1652025">--It can make an objection on its own behalf, which is to say that the government has not properly gone through the decision-making process.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="397.788" offset="1696538">That's the next -- that was going to be my next question: So the corporation can raise FOIA on its own behalf?</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony A. Yang</label>
            <text syncTime="404.359" offset="1722870">It's actually -- let me take a step back.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.013" offset="1745439">FOIA actions are actions which seek to increase the amount of documents that the government has released pursuant to a FOIA request.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.320" offset="1790683">We have also reverse FOIA actions, which are actions under the APA and here under the Hobbs Act's review provisions, that would give the court of appeals jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.526" offset="1835510">When there's a reverse FOIA action, the claim is that the agency's final agency action is somehow arbitrary, capricious, and not -- or contrary to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.567" offset="1875738">So in this case, the FCC has certain regulations which govern its processing of FOIA requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.988" offset="1905413">And AT&amp;T's claim, as we understand it, is that the FCC did not comply with its regulations and, therefore, its decision was arbitrary capricious because its regulations required that it consider the personal privacy interest of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.647" offset="1964032">I should note that, with respect to Exemption 6 or Exemption 7(C) the government itself invokes personal privacy of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.603" offset="1999872">That's what we do when we process FOIA requests, because individuals normally don't get any notice that there has been a FOIA request.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.478" offset="2039369">The government simply processes it and asserts those rights, in the sense that they're rights, asserts those interests on behalf of corporations -- on behalf of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.333" offset="2078762">Going back to the text of the statute, the term "privacy" and particularly an invasion of privacy invokes concepts that back to Warren and Brandeis's right of privacy, their article which explained that or identified in the law certain human dignitary interests that they gave the label privacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="559.959" offset="2345211">When we're talking about the right of privacy, those -- that word we think, again going back to Warren and Brandeis and up through the fifties and sixties when Prosser was elaborating the law of torts in his groundbreaking article on privacy, those concepts applied only to individuals, and particularly when you combine the terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.891" offset="2432982">The Restatement makes clear, and back to Prosser it was clear, that corporations have no right of personal privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.378" offset="2466941">So when Congress in 1974 was enacting Exemption 7(C), there would have been no basis for it to conclude that the rights that it was conferring through the phrase AT&amp;T is correct, foreign governments, State governments, local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.059" offset="2549697">There's no predicate for those types of entities having personal privacy in the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2612.988" offset="10557377">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.174" offset="10566154">I mean, if you're saying that personal privacy has some overlap with individual privacy -- obviously, it has to if you're going to give meaning to personal privacy -- don't we have to give meaning to "and similar files"?</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.636" offset="10635954">And so what would those be?</text>

            <text syncTime="2635.004" offset="10645462">Well, Your Honor, as this Court said in the Washington Post case, the understanding of similar files is defined by the two benchmarks that are expressly provided, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.444" offset="10687154">Personnel and medical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.312" offset="10694677">So the kinds of files are limited to the sorts of files in which individual information is likely to be contained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.334" offset="10726755">In that case, it was a passport file.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.101" offset="10733861">Again, our -- our argument is simply that it is that part of Exemption 6 that does the limited work in terms of its scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.457" offset="10767297">The words 6 as -- as they do in Exemption 7(C).</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.277" offset="10790494">The -- the other point that I certainly want to make clear is that our position is that personal privacy is only the first step in the determination whether or not a particular document is disclosed, because if the government prevails, there will be no need even to articulate a public interest in the disclosure of potentially harmful documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.428" offset="10903134">Instead, they will be automatically available to any competitor or legal adversary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.684" offset="10928107">And all we are asking for and indeed all that Congress provided for is that the privacy interests be weighed against the public interest in disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.206" offset="10966246">And what the FCC did here was to categorically exclude corporations from the protections of Exemption 7(C).</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.246" offset="11002399">And all we are saying is that those interests are legitimate and just need to be balanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.334" offset="11034791">And what the Government's obligations under these circumstances are is that they need to weigh the private interests in the documents against the articulated public interest in disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.809" offset="11088708">And that interest, of course, has to do with what the Government is up to, what do these documents tell us about what the Government is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.765" offset="11124443">And if, as the amici on the Government's side suggests, there are lots of public value and public interest in the disclosure, then that balance is more likely to be weighed in favor of disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.258" offset="11178465">All we are asking for, though, is that that balance take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.959" offset="11193302">And what's happened here is that this, as I said, a categorical exclusion that simply is inconsistent with the terms that Congress laid out in exemption 7(C).</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.450" offset="11239173">Congress did not intend for FOIA to be a tool for an organization's adversaries to obtain access to harmful or embarrassing documents compiled for law enforcement purposes where such documents do nothing to open agency action to public scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.979" offset="11309286">If the Government has its way in this case, the result will be what this Court decried in Favish, which was that it would be the failure to protect the privacy of citizens against the uncontrolled release of information compiled through the power of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.088" offset="11373756">If there are no further questions, I urge that the Third Circuit be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2830.331" offset="11426732">AT&amp;T appears to have changed or at least modified its position somewhat from the position articulated at page 14 of its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.437" offset="11459124">There AT&amp;T says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.437" offset="11467170">"By expressly defining the noun "person" to include corporations, Congress necessarily defined the adjective form of that noun, personal, also to include corporations. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.030" offset="11517534">Now, AT&amp;T has given up on the grammatical imperative that guided exclusively the court of appeals decision in this case, there's nothing left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.819" offset="11560688">AT&amp;T can provide no example where the term personal privacy has ever been used to refer to a corporation, much less a foreign government or state or local government in any context, whether it be FOIA, the law generally, or even in common usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.996" offset="11617426">AT&amp;T can provide no example of any problems that have arisen in over 35 years of the Government's consistent administration of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.018" offset="11653475">In fact, all indications point in simply one direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.620" offset="11667895">Personal privacy applies only to individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.505" offset="11679389">The terms personal and the terms privacy do that alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.290" offset="11690569">And together, personal privacy makes that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.059" offset="11701645">The legislative history, the decisions of this Court pointing to the balance applying only to individuals, individual rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.248" offset="11734455">All point in the same direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.414" offset="11743128">We would ask that the Third Circuit be reversed.</text>
