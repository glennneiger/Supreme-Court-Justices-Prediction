            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">This case, Sykes versus United States, is another in a series of cases the Court has decided under a federal statute known as the Armed Career Criminal Act, and that statute is commonly referred to as ACCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.496" offset="158365">ACCA makes it a federal crime for convicted felon to be in unlawful possession of a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.783" offset="183547">Now, the ordinary maximum sentence is 10 years of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.739" offset="199325">But if -- when the unlawful possession occurred, the felon had three previous convictions for a violent felony, then ACCA increases the punishment to a minimum term of 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.509" offset="262437">This case presents the issue whether flight from the police, when the felon uses a vehicle to flee, is a violent felony under ACAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.057" offset="296605">The Court of the Appeals for the Seventh Circuit found that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.430" offset="310084">We agree and we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.692" offset="319175">In determining whether an offense is a violent felony, the Court employs a categorical approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.421" offset="342058">That means it looks to the elements of the offense as a general matter not to the particular facts in the record of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.600" offset="374763">ACCA prescribes that a prior conviction qualifies if it is a crime enumerated in the statute, then there's a final clause, a residual clause and that residual clause says that an act is a violent felony if it otherwise involves conduct that presents serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.852" offset="463788">The question is whether a felon who uses a vehicle to flee from the police is covered by this residual clause and so, this case requires us to determine if vehicle flight from a police officer presents a serious risk of physical injury to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.589" offset="514779">Sykes was convicted of vehicle flight under Indiana law, and that introduces a slight complication, and that's because Indiana has a statute with a separate provision for using a vehicle to resist law enforcement office -- law enforcement in a variety of ways including flight, where that resistance involves a substantial risk of bodily injury to -- to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.050" offset="616552">Both relevant provisions carry the same penalties however, so they do not reflect an expectation that risky vehicle flights will be prosecuted only under the separate provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.465" offset="658244">We hold that the bar in flight from police, when the defender uses a vehicle to flee, involves a level of risk that qualifies it as a violent felony for ACAA purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.350" offset="697846">The -- the determination of the fleeing suspect to elude capture, show -- shows an inherent lack of concern for others' safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.320" offset="737656">However, he drives, the criminal attempting to elude capture, creates the possibility that the police will, in a legitimate and lawful manner, accelerate or use force to bring him within their custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.197" offset="785199">Although not dispositive, statistics confirm this commonsense conclusion, for instance, personal injury rates for arson and burglary are about 20% lower than they are for vehicle flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.758" offset="835459">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.082" offset="844758">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.335" offset="857715">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.918" offset="868059">Justice Kagan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg joins.</text>
