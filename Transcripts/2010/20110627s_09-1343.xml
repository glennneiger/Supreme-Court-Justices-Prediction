            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">This case arises from a products liability suit filed in a New Jersey state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.193" offset="129212">Robert Nicastro seriously injured his hand while using a metal shearing device, a machine that was manufactured by J. McIntyre Machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.165" offset="173098">The accident occurred in New Jersey, but the machine was made in England and England is where J. McIntyre is incorporated and that's where it operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.583" offset="210714">The question here is whether the New Jersey courts have jurisdiction over J. McIntyre, not withstanding the fact that the company at no time either marketed goods in the State or shipped from there.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.668" offset="255018">Of course, Nicastro was the plaintiff in the New Jersey trial court and is the respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.787" offset="275498">McIntyre was the defendant and is now the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.247" offset="289395">The New Jersey Supreme Court held that its states courts -- its state courts could exercise jurisdiction over petitioner McIntyre.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.081" offset="328683">It held that the company knew or recently should have known that its products were distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead to those products being sold in any of the 50 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.078" offset="376748">Six members of the Court agree that this judgment must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.475" offset="390332">I've written a plurality opinion joined by the Chief Justice and Justices Scalia and Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.142" offset="413006">That opinion explains that, at least in products liability cases, the sovereign's exercise of judicial power requires some act by which the defendant purposely avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the foreign State, thus invoking the benefits and the protection of its laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.167" offset="485104">This Court's decision in an earlier case, a case called “Asahi” may impart be responsible for the New Jersey's Supreme Court's contrary conclusion that the mere placement of goods in the stream of commerce can substitute for purposeful availment.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.822" offset="555635">Although, this Court invoke the stream of commerce metaphor in Asahi, it should be clear that there is no special rule of personal jurisdiction for products-liability cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.709" offset="595237">Justice Breyer has filed an -- an opinion concurring in the judgment joined by Justice Alito.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.691" offset="619165">He argues that none of this Court's precedence would support the exercise of jurisdiction over the defendant by petitioner who had only a single sale in the State as occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.323" offset="665663">Because the incident at issue in this case does not invocate modern concerns, the concurring opinion would avoid using this case as an opportunity to make broad pronouncements on basic jurisdictional rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.736" offset="711325">The petitioner is, thus, entitled to a dismissal of the suit for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.529" offset="726476">The contrary judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.883" offset="739955">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Sotomayor and Kegan joined.</text>
