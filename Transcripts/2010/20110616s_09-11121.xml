            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">This case comes to us from the Supreme Court of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.649" offset="128042">Under our decision in Miranda versus Arizona, a suspect must be warned of his rights before being subjected to custodial police interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.555" offset="175689">A suspect is in police custody if given all of the objective circumstances a reasonable person in the suspect's position would not feel at liberty to terminate questioning and leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.912" offset="237025">This case presents the question whether the age of a child subjected to police questioning is relevant to the Miranda custody analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.272" offset="282478">Petitioner was a 13-year-old child attending middle school classes when police removed him from his classroom and escorted him to a school conference room.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.867" offset="332842">There, petitioner was met by school administrators and an investigator with the local police force.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.462" offset="363248">For at least 30 minutes, petitioner was questioned about his involvement in two home breakings that occurred the prior weekend.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.814" offset="400656">Eventually, petitioner confessed to the crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.148" offset="418001">Petitioner was charged with breaking and entering and larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.211" offset="438272">He argued in the state court that his confession must be suppressed because he had been interrogated in a custodial setting without first receiving the warnings that Miranda requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.620" offset="495950">The (Inaudible) trial and appellate courts rejected this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.522" offset="515490">The North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed refusing to consider petitioner's age as part of that custody analysis, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.892" offset="560943">As we explained in our opinion filed with the clerk of the court today, we conclude that a child's age properly informs the Miranda custody analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.125" offset="605874">A child's age is an objective fact that would affect how a reasonable person in the suspect's position would perceive his freedom to terminate questioning and leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.927" offset="657178">Police officers in courts can account for that reality without compromising the objective nature of the custody analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.783" offset="692600">So long as the child's age was known to the officer at the time of police questioning or would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer, a child's age properly informs the Miranda custody analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.363" offset="762922">The judgment of the North Carolina Supreme Court is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.347" offset="778804">The case is remanded for the state courts to evaluate whether petitioner was in custody, when police interrogated him, this time taking into account of his age at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.519" offset="831467">Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas joined.</text>
