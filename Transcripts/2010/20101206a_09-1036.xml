            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1036, Henderson v. Shinseki.</text>

            <label>Ms. Lisa S. Blatt</label>
            <text syncTime="10.022" offset="145492">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.564" offset="175689">The Federal circuit's decision in this case forecloses judicial review when the very disability for which a veteran seeks benefits prevents the veteran from filing a timely appeal with the Veterans Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.134" offset="237965">That decision is wrong, and for three reasons the court of appeals erred in holding that the deadline at issue in this case is jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.256" offset="282478">First, the statute contains no clear indication that the deadline is jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.396" offset="311003">Rather, the text and structure points away from a jurisdictional reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.705" offset="328244">Second, the deadline that applies to disabled and largely uncounseled veterans seeking their first day in court is not the type of deadline that Congress would be expected to rank as jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.510" offset="391461">And third, a jurisdictional reading would render some of the most disabled of veterans the least likely to obtain benefits and would treat veterans worse off than almost all litigants in our federal system.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="87.536" offset="455513">Ms. Blatt, you do have a substantial hurdle to contend with in this Court's decision in Bowles v. Russell, which seemed to say if you have a time limit and it's statutory, it is mandatory and jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.949" offset="533253">So here, we have a time limit set by statute, not by rule, and why doesn't -- why isn't that dispositive?</text>

            <label>Ms. Lisa S. Blatt</label>
            <text syncTime="118.924" offset="581110">Because neither this Court's decision in Bowles nor any other decision by this Court holds that this type of an appeal from a pro-claimant and non-adversarial proceeding to a court of first review clearly speaks in jurisdictional terms, notwithstanding the lack of a jurisdictional label.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="138.293" offset="658641">Gee, I thought Bowles was a nice, clear case.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.824" offset="668672">I mean, you could always find some distinction in the next case, and I thought the object of Bowles was to say if it's a limit on appeal, it's jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.820" offset="712662">That would -- and that's, I gather, what the Federal circuit took it to mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.065" offset="733665">And I would have done that if I was down there, probably.</text>

            <label>Ms. Lisa S. Blatt</label>
            <text syncTime="159.923" offset="745159">I can understand why maybe the Federal circuit did it, because of the one statement that the Court, I think, took out of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.455" offset="771281">But this Court's decision in Bowles didn't purport to extend to any statute, no matter what the statute said or what the context it arose in, and the most closely analogous context of an appeal of agency action to a court of first review is a Social Security context.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.746" offset="840453">And even if you don't think that that context is directly on point, then the historical backdrop at most would be inconclusive, and that hardly would rise to the type of--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="193.443" stopTime="200.003">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="193.443" offset="879219">Doesn't the Social Security context -- it doesn't speak of an appeal, does it?</text>
            <text syncTime="198.251" offset="898445">It talks of a civil action.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="201.750" offset="912447">I mean, you're right that there is -- you know, there is a parallel in what's going on, but the statute does not call it an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.296" offset="942644">It calls it bringing a civil action to challenge the decision.</text>

            <label>Ms. Lisa S. Blatt</label>
            <text syncTime="212.965" offset="957273">--Right, and there is nothing inherently jurisdictional about the word "appeal".</text>
            <text syncTime="217.010" offset="973469">And Justice Scalia, if Congress that passed this statute wanted to pick up on the jurisdictional rule under 28 2107, presumably it would have written a statute that looks something like that statute with the safety valves.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.533" offset="1035536">Of course, when a -- all litigants, civil litigants who are appealing a district court judgment to a Court of Appeals, they have a jurisdictional deadline, but the district court can extend it for good cause or excusable neglect or when the party lacks notice of an adverse judgment or, importantly, the Federal rules of appellate procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.651" offset="1115993">Here's a situation when a litigant timely files his appeal, but does so in the wrong form.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.193" offset="1138145">In this statute Congress knew how to incorporate the jurisdictional rule of Bowles.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.581" offset="1159774">It did so in a separate provision of the statute in 7292(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="268.080" offset="1177746">It said when a litigant wants to go from the Veterans Court and appeal that decision to the Federal circuit, the litigant has to follow the time and the manner prescribed for appealing district court judgments to Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="315.434" offset="1367186">I think what's important is that Bowles is relying on a series of decisions that had nothing to do with the word "notice of appeal", of course, because they were dealing with cases involving writs of error and petitions for a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.975" offset="1417341">It was all in the context of court-to-court appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.943" offset="1429149">Bowles doesn't even mention agency appeal of agency action to a court of first review.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.112" offset="1449838">So what's the rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="337.142" offset="1454017">Justice Scalia said those seem to establish a sensible, clear rule, which is if Congress uses the word "notice of appeal", it intends a jurisdictional restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.636" offset="1503963">That appears to be the rule that Justice Scalia articulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.604" offset="1523816">What would be your rule or test now to determine Congress's purpose?</text>

            <text syncTime="399.191" offset="1702181">Notice of appeal is not jurisdictional in the criminal context and Congress used the word "appeal" throughout this particular statute in a non-jurisdictional meaning in all the proceedings that go in the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.172" offset="1746066">It used the term "appellant" and "review on appeal".</text>
            <text syncTime="414.606" offset="1763830">It's actually called the board of veterans appeal, substantive appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.356" offset="1778876">None of those words have "jurisdictional".</text>
            <text syncTime="419.854" offset="1784832">And if Congress was just thinking of the word 7252(a), and that makes no reference to the 120-day deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.016" offset="1901443">And I think in terms of the context, let's -- this is exactly the type of deadline that Congress would be expected to be subject to equitable tolling.</text>

            <text syncTime="471.476" offset="1991304">And perhaps that's not a big problem, if there are not a lot of other statutes like this one that use the term "notice of appeal" and with respect to which it is not settled whether it is jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.031" offset="2045534">Do you have any sense of how many others there might be?</text>

            <text syncTime="488.420" offset="2059118">I think I found four that used the term "notice of appeal", and it was in connection with the district court, and they weren't even reported cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.214" offset="2086285">They were very esoteric situations, like an order from the Department of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.101" offset="2101854">I mean, maybe the government has different.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.711" offset="2108228">What you mostly see is the Hobbs Act context, where you are talking about either an organic statute or 28 U.S.C. 2344, which is just a simple petition for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.895" offset="2152950">That doesn't even use the word "notice of appeal".</text>
            <text syncTime="514.110" offset="2161831">So this case is not going to dictate a whole lot, except for the veterans context, where not only do you have the standard lack of indication that this is not a jurisdictional, but you have the unique features in that Congress established this Court to open the door to veterans seeking disability benefits, and it would just conflict with that purpose to, at the same time, shut the door when the veteran's disability prevents him from getting to the courthouse.</text>

            <text syncTime="560.354" offset="2346883">The government's position assumes that no matter what the circumstances were -- and remember, a lot of these cases, the veteran is actually timely filing his appeal; he mistakenly files in the Veterans Administration rather than the Veterans Court -- and the government assumes that these uncounseled veterans are simply out of time and out of luck with no exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="2111.047" offset="8549606">And the fact that there are exceptions written into it lends some support to the notion that we, as a court, should not read other exceptions into it that weren't mentioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2147.733" offset="8696310">The first is that there are many statutes, including the Hobbs Act, the immigration statute, that have no provision for exceptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2192.075" offset="8873733">So sometimes you will see that Congress, given the context, probably did want to give the court some leeway to make exceptions -- where, for example, it is no fault of the litigant -- and in other instances, they didn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="3526.766" offset="14212535">--And I understand the government representing that there is notice, and I am telling you that is not my understanding; that when he said authorized representative, I don't think that that meant veterans service organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.781" offset="14248584">I may be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.811" offset="14252659">It sounds like we have a different understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.998" offset="14261436">But if I can get back on to what is really before this Court, is that when there's no indication, all we have is the three words -- "notice of appeal" -- when we know that those three words are non-jurisdictional in the criminal context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.148" offset="14313994">There is nothing jurisdictional about the words "notice of appeal".</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.539" offset="14323608">It accurately describes that an appeal is going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.570" offset="14331653">It doesn't say anything about whether the deadline is jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.615" offset="14343879">And the question is: Was Congress thinking about the type of people who appeal district courts to courts of appeals?</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.189" offset="14374181">Yes, they were, but they made separate provisions for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.127" offset="14381913">Or were they thinking about the Hobbs Act, which deals with licensing of the nuclear power plants and orders by the FCC, and has an express statement in the text that it is jurisdictional?</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.323" offset="14422664">I doubt that -- I think it is safe to say that Congress was not thinking about any of those contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.946" offset="14445234">They were trying to give veterans their day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.664" offset="14456101">And this decision would say no matter what the circumstances were, they are deprived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.179" offset="14478148">Now there was some discussion on the 120-day deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.332" offset="14486716">I think another thing that is very safe to say is that time is not of the essence in the veterans system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.392" offset="14510958">It never has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.425" offset="14515137">120 days is a blink of an eye.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.108" offset="14525900">It is true that Social Security are given 60 days and other appellants are given 30.</text>
