            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Police officers responded to a call that a man had been shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.603" offset="128857">They found Anthony -- Anthony Covington lying in a gas station parking lot, bleeding from a mortal gunshot wound to his stomach.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.013" offset="166473">The police officer first asked him, “What happened?”</text>
            <text syncTime="18.603" offset="180893">He told them the respondent Richard Bryant had shot him about 25 minutes earlier in a few blocks away.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.586" offset="212762">Covington died a few hours later.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.271" offset="223525">At Bryant's trial, the police officers testified about what Covington said to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.822" offset="249752">Bryant was convicted but on appeal, the Michigan Supreme Court reversed holding that Covington's statements to the police were inadmissible hearsay under our decisions in Crawford versus Washington and Davis versus Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.922" offset="314117">We granted certiorari to decide whether the Michigan Supreme Court was correct that Covington statements were testimonial.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.517" offset="348494">We now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.476" offset="356331">In Crawford, we held that the confrontation clause in the Sixth Amendment to our Constitution requires that defendants have the opportunity to confront those who provide testimonial evidence against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.226" offset="411397">In Davis, we explained that statements made in the course of police interrogations are non-testimonial when they have a primary purpose of enabling police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.372" offset="471897">They are testimonial when they have a primary purpose to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.791" offset="513588">To determine the primary purpose of an interrogation, we objectively evaluate the statements and actions of the parties to the encounter in light of the circumstances in which the investigation occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.761" offset="569490">The existence of an ongoing emergency or the parties' perception that an emergency is ongoing is among the most important circumstances in forming our analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.348" offset="615884">The scope and duration of an emergency depends on the context including the type of dispute, the type of weapon employed and the medical state of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.566" offset="660710">The formality or informality of the interaction also sheds lights on its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.628" offset="688922">In addition, the statements and actions of both the decelerant and interrogators provide important evidence about the interrogation's primary purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.660" offset="737092">In this case, we conclude that the primary purpose of the interrogation was to address an ongoing emergency, first, the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.238" offset="775440">Here, an arm shooter whose motive for and location was unknown had mortally -- mortally wounded Covington within a few blocks and a few minutes of where the police found him.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.260" offset="823505">Unlike the domestic violence situation in Davis, this disputes possible scope and thus the emergency potentially threatened the police in the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.566" offset="868749">This case also involved a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.591" offset="880765">Turning to the statements and actions of the parties, we first did consider the decelerant.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.176" offset="903126">The police found Covington lying in a gas station parking lot, bleeding from a mortal -- mortal gunshot wound and statements were punctuated with questions about when emergency medical services would arrive.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.259" offset="959446">We cannot say that a person in his situation would have had a primary -- primary purpose of providing testimonial statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.755" offset="993510">That is statements to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.376" offset="1023916">For their part, the police responded to a call that a man had been shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.821" offset="1041680">They did not know why, where or when the shooting had occurred, the shooter's location or anything else about the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.193" offset="1075221">They asked exactly the type of questions necessary to enable them to lead an ongoing emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.962" offset="1102284">Nothing in Covington's responses indicated that there was no emergency or that the emergency had ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.230" offset="1131332">Finally, this situation was quite informal.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.050" offset="1142617">The officers all arrived at different times as repetitive questions and generally did not conduct the structured interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.504" offset="1176472">For the four going reasons, we hold that Covington statements were not testimonial and that their admission at Bryant's trial did not violate the confrontation clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.051" offset="1218685">We reversed the judgment of the Michigan Supreme Court and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.639" offset="1248987">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.759" offset="1265497">Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg have each filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
