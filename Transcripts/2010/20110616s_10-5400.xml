            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">The question in this case is whether a federal judge can impose or lengthen a prison sentence because he believes that imprisonment will aid in a criminal offender's rehabilitation, for example, by enabling that person to get drug treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.210" offset="174226">Petitioner Alejandra Tapia was convicted of several federal crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.085" offset="193766">At sentencing, the judge chose a 51-month prison term for her sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.231" offset="214350">In explaining this sentence, the judge referred several times to Tapia's need for drug treatment, citing a prison rehabilitation program called the 500 Hour Drug Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.384" offset="262938">The court said some things that suggested that Tapia should serve a prison term long enough to qualify for and to complete that program.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.470" offset="303271">On appeal, Tapia argued that the judge had erred by lengthening her prison term to make her eligible for the 500 Hour Drug Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.647" offset="340052">She argued that this violated a provision in the Sentencing Reform Act, which tells the sentencing court, and I'm quoting here, "to recognize that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation".</text>
            <text syncTime="73.783" offset="400551">The Court of Appeals disagreed with Tapia.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.688" offset="412150">We took this case to resolve a conflict among the Circuit Courts and we now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.659" offset="432107">We agree with Tapia's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.963" offset="445273">Our decision starts with the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.516" offset="455513">The provision at issue here, Section 3582, instructs sentencing courts, and I'm going to quote it again, "to recognize that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation".</text>
            <text syncTime="101.579" offset="511728">That is a straightforward statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.964" offset="521237">It tells a court that imprisonment is not a suitable sanction for the purpose of facilitating a criminal offender's rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.524" offset="555510">And it tells courts that they should recognize this fact either when determining whether to impose a term of imprisonment or when determining the length of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.139" offset="597932">In other words, the defendant cannot be sentenced to prison to promote his rehabilitation and his sentence also cannot be lengthened for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.306" offset="634608">The statutory context supports this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.859" offset="648819">There is another provision of the Sentencing Reform Act that says something quite similar to a different audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.879" offset="672956">It tells the Federal Sentencing Commission to write Sentencing Guidelines that reflects the inappropriateness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.352" offset="726873">That is the same message that Section 3582 sends to sentencing courts, do not use prison to promote the defendant's rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.784" offset="772535">And we also note that Congress do not give judges the power to make sure the defendants actually gets treatment while behind bars.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.028" offset="809524">That is yet another sign that Congress did not want judges to order imprisonment for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.565" offset="835647">The United States does not disagree with this interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.329" offset="850693">In fact, it declines to defend the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.980" offset="873368">And so, we appointed an amicus curiae, a friend of the Court, to make arguments on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.121" offset="901893">The amicus we chose did an exceptionally good job, making a variety of arguments that rehabilitation may sometimes, under some circumstances, be taken into account as the basis for a prison sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.970" offset="961348">We address these arguments in the opinion, but here, it is enough to say that they are insufficient to overcome the clear statutory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.036" offset="997606">Returning to the details of this case, the District Judge's statements suggest that he may have lengthened Tapia's sentence to ensure that she received drug treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.884" offset="1040969">If so, the sentence would conflict with the Sentencing Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.541" offset="1059568">We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.675" offset="1084123">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.295" offset="1094572">Justice Sotomayor has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Alito joins.</text>
