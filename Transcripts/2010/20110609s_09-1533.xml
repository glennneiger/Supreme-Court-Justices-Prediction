            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">In the first case, at the time of petitioner Frantz DePierre's conviction in sentence, clause (iii) of 21 U.S.C. 841 (b)(1)(a), provided a mandatory ten-year minimum sentence for certain drug offenses involving 50 grams or more of a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.980" offset="200265">DePierre, was convicted by a jury of distributing 50 grams or more of cocaine base, and he was sentence to ten years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.958" offset="236210">This case presents the question whether the term "cocaine base" in clause subdivision (iii) refers to the chemically basic form of cocaine as the government who argues, or whether it refers strictly to crack cocaine as DePierre would have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.102" offset="308830">Cocaine is a chemically basic compound derived from the coca plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.524" offset="330459">The leaves of which can be processed into a smokable paste-like substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.014" offset="352402">When this coca paste is processed with hydrochloric acid, the result is cocaine hydrochloride, the powder form of cocaine which is most commonly snorted.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.184" offset="405170">Cocaine hydrochloride is not a base.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.525" offset="418544">It is a salt with a different molecular formula than chemically basic cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.877" offset="443935">However, it can be converted into chemically basic cocaine by processing it with a base like baking soda, producing crack cocaine which is smoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.336" offset="489702">Cocaine hydrochloride can also be processed with ammonia to produce a less common smokable drug known as "freebase".</text>
            <text syncTime="106.008" offset="528468">Coca paste, crack cocaine, and freebase, all contain cocaine in its basic form.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.070" offset="560650">We agree with the government that the most natural reading of the term "cocaine base" is chemically basic cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.918" offset="596072">In arguing that the term should be read instead to mean only crack cocaine, DePierre asked so as to stray far from the statute's text, as the term "crack cocaine" appears nowhere in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.067" offset="652706">Although the term "cocaine base" is somewhat redundant, from a chemical prospective, cocaine is a base.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.749" offset="683426">We think Congress had good reason to use cocaine in clause (iii), namely to distinguish the substances covered by that clause from the cocaine related substances enumerated in another clause in the statute, which provides lower penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.598" offset="754792">At the time Congress enacted the statute, the word "cocaine" was commonly used to refer simply to cocaine hydrochloride that is powder cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.907" offset="800037">And in the scientific and medical literature, if it wasn't confusing enough, the word "cocaine" is often used to refer to all cocaine related substances including powder cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.068" offset="848624">Thus, the term "cocaine base" serves to delineate the precise set of substances subject to the higher penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.537" offset="882584">As we explain in our opinion, we are also not convinced by DePierre's additional arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.503" offset="910378">We do not agree that reading cocaine base in clause (iii) to mean chemically basic cocaine, renders superfluous, the word "cocaine" used elsewhere in the statute, nor does our interpretation produce an absurd result.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.340" offset="969728">We are also not persuaded by DePierre's suggestion that when Congress enacted this provision, it was all -- it was solely concerned with the special dangers produced by crack cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.397" offset="1018002">And finally, the fact that the United States Sentencing Commission has defined cocaine as used in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to mean "crack cocaine," does not mean that the statute in this case must be interpreted in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.173" offset="1081114">In some, we hold that the term "cocaine base" as used in 841 (b) (1), means chemically basic cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.744" offset="1115387">The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is affirmed.</text>
