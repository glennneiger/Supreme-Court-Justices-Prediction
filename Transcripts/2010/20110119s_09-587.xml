            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">The Court today decides two cases in which the Court of Appeals for Ninth Circuit granted federal habeas corpus relief to persons convicted under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.323" offset="146745">In both cases, we find the Court of Appeals committed error.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.555" offset="159598">The first of this is Harrington versus Richter, Number 09-587.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.957" offset="181227">The respondent was Richter, claims he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial because his attorney did not consult experts in preparation for the trial or call experts to the stand during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.898" offset="237025">The experts that Richter now says counsel should have consulted where experts in blood evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.222" offset="258341">In order to reach the legal issues, the opinion recites the details of the crime at some length, just a brief account is necessary here.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.637" offset="288016">The crime occurred among four persons and they all knew each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.660" offset="304107">The prosecution maintained that -- that there were two victims and two assailants and one of the assailants was -- was Richter.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.890" offset="332946">The prosecution said Richter and the accomplice returned to the house where the four men had all been present earlier in the evening and Richter and his accomplice shot the other two.One survived, the other died.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.002" offset="377459">Richter wanted the jury to believe that one of the victims had fired at his companion and that the companion had fired back in self-defense and that the deceased was killed in the crossfire.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.354" offset="418837">And to support his version of the events, Richter suggested that after he and his friend left the scene of the shootings, the victim who survived moved the other victim's body to another room.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.010" offset="465439">And according to Richter, this was the theory that the defense counsel should have supported, by consulting and offering testimony from experts, blood experts in serology and blood spatter patterns and -- and pathology.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.987" offset="521341">Now, the jury did not hear any defense experts on blood nor did Richter's counsel consult blood experts in preparation for the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.806" offset="556659">The jury did not accept the self-defense theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.648" offset="563973">They convicted Richter of first degree murder, he receives a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.585" offset="575781">A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals, in agreement with the state courts and the Federal District Court, denied relief on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.813" offset="616636">Sitting en banc, however, the Court of Appeals ordered the habeas relief be granted and we now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.742" offset="640355">The controlling case on effective assistance of counsel, which contains the standards that we apply here today after reaching the procedural points, is Strickland versus Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.478" offset="691346">But in considering whether to order federal habeas corpus relief to vacate a state conviction, after the state courts have denied relief, federal courts are constrained by the limitation in a federal statute and that statute is the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, commonly known as AEDPA and the relevant provision is 28 U.S.C. Section 2254(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="168.721" offset="780267">That statute limits federal habeas relief for any claim presented in the federal habeas petition that was adjudicated on the merits in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.683" offset="816107">In rejecting Richter's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the State Court, the Supreme Court of California, issued a one line order.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.714" offset="848290">And the first question addressed in the opinion is whether the California Supreme Court order was an adjudication on the merits of Richter's ineffective assistance of counsel claim and we hope that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.788" offset="892594">The text of the statute requires only a state court adjudication on the merits, that's the statutory phrase, it had to be an adjudication on the merits but it doesn't require an -- an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.308" offset="938674">On the basic issues in the case, the Court of Appeals failed to accord the deference required by AEDPA and by Strickland.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.182" offset="966154">As a condition for obtaining habeas corpus from a federal court, AEDPA requires a state prisoner to show that the State's ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification, that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fair-minded disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.374" offset="1050896">Now, this standard was meant to be difficult to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.080" offset="1065733">Section 2254 stops short of imposing a complete bar on federal court relitigation of claims already rejected in state proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.205" offset="1102200">And it preserves the authority to issue the writ in cases where there is no possibility, fair-minded jurors -- jurist could disagree with the state court's decision as conflicting with this Court's precedence.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.986" offset="1161341">But it goes no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.696" offset="1168238">And the reason for this approach -- the reasons for this approach are familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.589" offset="1187777">A federal habeas review frustrates State eff -- efforts to punish offenders and it undermines State efforts to honor constitutional rights and disturbs society's interest in repose.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.513" offset="1227483">Federal habeas corpus intrudes on state sovereignty to a degree matched by few exercises of federal judicial authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.511" offset="1259457">So, the question in this case is not whether counsels' action satisfies Strickland's standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.640" offset="1279937">Section 2254(d) applies so the question is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfy that standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.959" offset="1309299">If the Court of Appeals gave Section 2254 no operation or function in its reasoning, its analysis -- illustrates a lack of deference to the state court's determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.636" offset="1347960">This was contrary to the purpose and mandate of AEDPA and to the now well-settled meaning and function of habeas corpus in the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.489" offset="1375336">Even apart from the limitations imposed by AEDPA, the Court of Appeals misapplied Strickland.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.310" offset="1394667">Relief is warranted under Strickland only if an attorney made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.281" offset="1430507">The question Strickland asked is whether an attorney's performance amounted to incompetence under prevailing professional norms, not whether it deviated from best practices or most common custom.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.248" offset="1482439">And there is a strong presumption that counsel's representation was within the range of reasonable professional assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.376" offset="1510964">Here, counsel could decide not to consult with blood experts for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.186" offset="1530190">There are many differences between the prosecution and defense version of the shootings.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.425" offset="1547118">Reliance on the harsh light of hindsight to second-guess trial proceedings is precisely what Strickland and AEDPA forbid.Even if it had been apparent that blood evidence could've supported the defense, a reasonable attorney could choose not to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.208" offset="1602288">To support a defense argument, the prosecution has not proved its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.175" offset="1618171">It is sometimes better for the defense to try to cast pervasive suspicion of doubt rather than to try to prove a certainty that exonerates.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.702" offset="1660280">The Court of Appeals also erred in finding that Richter suffered prejudice as a result of the failure to pursue forensic evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.980" offset="1685358">The evidence Richter says his counsel was required to introduce, could be reconciled with the considerable evidence that re -- remained that pointed to his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.126" offset="1717959">There was ample basis for the California Supreme Court to think any possibility of Richter being acquitted was eclipsed by the other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.752" offset="1752440">The writ of habeas corpus stands as a safeguard against imprisonment of those held in violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.549" offset="1775637">And judges must be vigilant and independent in reviewing petitions for the writ, a commitment that entails substantial judicial resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.136" offset="1813985">But those resources are diminished and misspent and confidence in the writ and the law it vindicates or undermined, if there is judicial disregard for the sound and established principles that informs it proper issuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.158" offset="1866021">And that judicial regard is inherent and in the Appeals' Court judgment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.565" offset="1883679">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.925" offset="1893083">The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the Court's opinion.Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.466" offset="1923281">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
