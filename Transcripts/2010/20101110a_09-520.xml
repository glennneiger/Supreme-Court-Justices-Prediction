            <text syncTime="11.306" offset="150612">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.558" offset="159702">The pivotal, and in my judgment, incorrect holding of the Eleventh Circuit in the Norfolk Southern case is reproduced in the appendix to this case, because Norfolk Southern is the controlling precedent for our -- for our particular dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.131" offset="209962">And at page 29A of the appendix to the petition, in there, the court of appeals said that there is nothing in the 4-R Act's plain language that indicates an intent to reach exemptions content from generally applicable sales and use taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.208" offset="262207">To our way of thinking, all this case is about: Whether or not the State has free reign to employ exemptions without exposing the effects of those exemptions to a challenge under (b)(4) of the statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="54.235" stopTime="74.298">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="54.235" offset="322393">But in light of our AFC case, it seems to me that what you are arguing is that the statute -- the effect of your argument is that the statute gives more protection in the case of non-property taxes than property taxes, and that's an -- an odd reading of the statute, which is directed primarily to the -- to the property tax.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="74.298" stopTime="118.243">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="74.298" offset="402641">No, I think, Justice Kennedy, what we are doing is recognizing that Congress was very specific and very explicit about how to treat property taxes and set up an entire quite carefully articulated scheme in dealing with them in (b)(1) and (b)(3), and then said, in general, when you are dealing with areas that are not approved by (b)(1) and (b)(3), then you have to examine whether or not the overall scheme, in fact, discriminates against rail carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.830" offset="500757">So, while it is true that there could be circumstances in which you may end up with somewhat more protection as a consequence of (b)(4), I think that's a function of Congress not having limited the (b)(4) exemption to property, and just saying it's -- it's a discrimination against the rail carrier generally that the statute is aimed to prevent or to protect against.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="118.243" offset="578393">But what's the -- what's the possible rationale for that distinction?</text>
            <text syncTime="121.195" offset="590200">Why would that distinction make any sense?</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="123.045" offset="597619">Well, I think because Congress didn't have the full run mine of possibilities in front of it at that point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.632" offset="627921">I mean, it probably had some sense of what other taxes were out there that might pose discrimination, but I do think that Congress is very much concerned that the States, once they saw the roadmap laid out for them in (b)(1) through (b)(3), might seek other ways to recoup what they were going to lose in revenues when the 3-year period lapsed, and to be in a position to protect the railroads in the (b)(4) -- through (b)(4) in a situation when there would be future actions taken by the States.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.984" offset="749338">Not -- there's very little in the legislative record, Your Honor, because the -- the specific formulation of -- of this (b)(4) catch-all provision comes in very, very late in the 15-year process.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.827" offset="808688">Every other lower court that -- every lower court that has looked at it has drawn the inference, which seems to me the only fair inference to draw, when Congress said: Look, this is not just for in lieu taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.350" offset="850798">I mean, there was -- there was some debate about that going on between the House and the Senate, and the conference committee makes it clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.836" offset="876816">This is not just something that's adopted by the States in lieu of a broader property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.221" offset="894265">It is intended, then, to have, I think, the language that you would normally give to a term as broad and sweeping as any other tax that discriminates against rail carriers.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.841" offset="1684835">You know, when Congress says, we want to -- we want to eliminate any tax that discriminates against, the one thing it seems to me, clearly, Congress did not intend to exclude from that was a tax that discriminates against the -- the immediate direct competitors of the railroads in a way that would undoubtedly undermine the stability of the -- the financial stability and success of the railroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="559.028" offset="2341554">And if it's -- if it's a discrimination that doesn't achieve either of those, then it seems to me you either say they are -- are not similarly situated or you would held -- you would hold that the State has a legitimate reason for doing what it's doing, and that that's just not a discrimination within the meaning of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="645.384" offset="2686997">It seems to me the right answer to this is, there is no reason to include your widow as a relative comparison class for purposes of (b)(4) and get out of that problem as opposed to setting this up.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.072" offset="2733704">To me, the fallacy of this analysis is to try to use exemptions and say that there is something special about exemptions beyond the (b)(1), (b)(3) context where Congress clearly acted, recognizing that it had to protect the States' ability to have exemptions for property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.284" offset="2806533">But then Congress goes to non-property taxes and to other taxes not covered by (b)(1) and (b)(3).</text>

            <text syncTime="708.886" offset="2941012">Because one answer to your argument is: Well, they haven't created a non-tax situation for the other interstate carriers; they are just subject to a different tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.228" offset="2998376">The motor carriers have to pay motor fuel tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.680" offset="3012169">So are you saying to the State about that, you have to have the same sales tax, use tax, for everyone; you can't have a motor fuel tax for one and sales tax for the other?</text>

            <text syncTime="741.956" offset="3073296">I think, ultimately, my conclusion would be that you can't have one -- you can't have this kind of a tax on us and not tax the motor carriers the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.896" offset="3113002">But I do think it's important to recognize two considerations, at least as this case comes to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.614" offset="3135885">One is that the State and the trial court conceded that the appropriate comparison class was the motor and water carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.036" offset="3165560">So the question of who is the -- who is properly in the comparison class has never been adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.838" offset="3188757">And second, it seems to me that the question of what constitutes discrimination is not the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.158" offset="3214043">The only question in this case is whether there is something special about exemptions that makes them off-limits to the (b)(4) inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.329" offset="3246749">So I think, candidly, Justice Ginsburg, while I'm quite certain that Alabama and I would disagree fundamentally about how to approach this, it doesn't seem to me that that's a question that this Court should tarry long over, and instead ought to simply evaluate the very narrow question that was both presented by the holding below and presented in the petition as it came through the Solicitor General's invitation stage, which again, as I say, very narrowly focuses exclusively on exemptions, and of course allow us to have them.</text>

            <text syncTime="834.326" offset="3442772">And the property tax, we know, they wanted to preserve the exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.730" offset="3468372">So why not take this latecomer of thought or discussion and say: Well, we'll assume that they want to treat that with regard to exemptions the same way that they treated property tax, which was the big-ticket item.</text>

            <text syncTime="860.960" offset="3549247">Well, I think part of the reason, it may well be because the property tax was a big-ticket item, so you were trying to protect certain State interests, and Congress did it very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.916" offset="3593132">I think it is quite a remarkable stretch of -- of construction of the statute for the Court to say, we're going to take this very carefully reticulated scheme, which creates the inference that Congress meant to protect these kinds of exemptions for the States, and say we are going to now incorporate that wholesale, when Congress didn't use language that in any way compares.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.697" offset="3688218">It didn't include -- it didn't limit it to railroad property.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.816" offset="3704728">It didn't define a class in any particular way, and instead, it basically said, what we need here is something that will protect the railroads when the States become more innovative and come forward with additional problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.326" offset="3762719">And we would leave it to the courts, unfortunately -- I recognize that is not the most satisfying solution sometimes, but we will leave it to the courts to decide what forms of discrimination we would have intended to preclude, because we are here to protect the railroads.</text>

            <text syncTime="950.266" offset="3906497">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="953.801" offset="3920603">The only question that the Court needs to resolve today is whether a non-property tax that's imposed on a rail carrier but from which its competitors are exempt can ever be another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier under subsection (b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="968.728" offset="3980372">The answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.228" offset="3986328">A lot of the Court's questions focus on some of the difficulties that are inherent in a discrimination inquiry, but as Mr. Phillips pointed out, those difficulties are just as inherent in a discrimination inquiry under (b)(4), whether we are talking about exemptions or whether we are talking about differential tax rates or whether we are talking about any other type of discrimination claim that can be brought under (b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="993.759" offset="4080473">That is the very nature of (b)(4): It broadly prohibits another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier, and inherent is that is the notion that courts are going to have to decide what it means to discriminate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1016.709" offset="4172215">I don't think the Court has to decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.244" offset="4182350">As Mr. Phillips pointed out, that was an issue that was conceded below by the State, at least at this stage of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.462" offset="4203248">And they acknowledged that in note 7 of their brief, so it wasn't something that was addressed by the Eleventh Circuit below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.949" offset="4233237">I think, as the Court wants to address it, it should reject the notion that the only comparison class in a (b)(4) case, no matter what the (b)(4) case looks like, is all other commercial and industrial taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.625" offset="4287885">And I think the Court should reject that primarily because that's not what the tax says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.927" offset="4305126">If you look at the language of (b)(4), it talks about another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.564" offset="4327696">Congress easily could have said another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier, as compared to other commercial and industrial taxpayers, and it didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.170" offset="4366148">And Justice Ginsburg, to your question involving whether we should be focusing on interstate versus local businesses and whether that was Congress's focus, of course that was -- that was certainly one of their concerns, but the reason that doesn't work is if you look to even subsections (b)(1) through (3), the comparison that is very clearly spelled out there is not between local businesses and interstate businesses; it's between rail transportation property and other commercial and industrial property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.570" offset="4479728">Now, that other commercial and industrial property can be owned by an interstate business like Wal-Mart just as easily as it can be owned by a local coffee shop, and so I think to suggest that the only thing Congress wanted to prohibit was this local interstate type of discrimination is not borne out by the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.965" offset="4553289">If you look at subsection (b)(4), we think the language speaks for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.933" offset="4569172">It speaks broadly of another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.469" offset="4587248">Another question that a number of you have asked is why Congress would want to treat property taxes' exemptions differently than non-property tax exemptions, and I think the answer has to come from the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.377" offset="4642941">In ACF, this court concluded that Congress did not want to prohibit property tax exemptions based on the text of the statute and its structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.382" offset="4678990">And when it comes to non-property taxes, the text of the act and the structure of the act simply tell a different story, and that has to be the best indicator of what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.373" offset="4722876">Again, subsection (b)(4) speaks broadly of another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.175" offset="4746073">This court has long recognized that taxes can discriminate in a number of different ways, including by granting some taxpayers an exemption and not granting that exemption to other taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.983" offset="4793302">That's the ordinary meaning of (b)(4) is easily susceptible to that meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1205.970" offset="4929348">I'd also note that the arguments that were made with respect to subsection (c) in this case were brought up by the government in ACF; and in ACF the government explained why the best reading of subsection (c) is a broad grant of jurisdiction over all violations of subsection (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.145" offset="4989952">That's clearly what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.645" offset="4996012">While Congress intended to provide a substantive right for rail carriers to come into court and claim discrimination on one of the four -- under one of the four subsections, it also intended to provide a Federal forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.869" offset="5048884">And the reason that it did that was because at the time, rail carriers were having a very hard time bringing claims in the State court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1584.894" offset="6444972">Justice Kennedy, you hit on the proper definition of a tax that discriminates in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.779" offset="6464512">A tax that discriminates under (b)(1), (2), and (3) is a tax that singles out railroads as compared to the general mass of taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.683" offset="6496172">So another tax that discriminates is a tax that singles out railroads as compared to the general mass of taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.888" offset="6525012">The pivotal question in this case is the one raised by Justice Kagan and Justice Scalia, and that is: Why in the world would Congress, on the one hand, say you can exempt property taxes under this statute, but you can't -- you -- we are prohibiting sales and use tax exemptions, when for 15 years Congress never had a single hearing, a single study, and never even heard a single complaint from the railroads about discriminatory sales and use taxes?</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.224" offset="6642354">Well, it may be because the universe of non-property taxes is -- so infinitely large that there's a much greater room for -- a much great danger of discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.681" offset="6700136">But again, I think the answer is what Justice Ginsberg was pointing out, that we would say the United States and CSX still has not come up with a good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.620" offset="6735872">They basically said -- the United States said, you just look at the statute and it tells a different story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.822" offset="6752695">There are three good reasons that Congress would have intended, and the Court should read property tax exemptions and non-property tax exemptions to be read the same way, and the first one is the one that Justice Ginsberg was pointing out: The purpose of the statute was to protect out-of-State, interstate businesses from being easy prey in the State legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.069" offset="6833674">They don't have voting power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.085" offset="6837750">But if you put an interstate business in the generally applicable tax scheme, that means they are paying the same tax as the local businesses and local taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.924" offset="6873067">They are protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.190" offset="6878187">If the tax rate goes up, the local businesses, the local taxpayers, will protect them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.078" offset="6897727">If too many exemptions occur, the local taxpayers and the local businesses will protect them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3208.305" offset="12938595">But there is one clear, easy way to see that the railroads didn't really believe that this was a clear statement against generally applicable sales and use taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3220.947" offset="12989168">It's very telling that the railroads didn't sue any State, despite we have been taxing this way since the 1930s, until the late 80s or early 90s under this theory, because even they when they read this statute, understood it to mean only if we are singled out or targeted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.889" offset="13053012">That's the way they litigated (b)(4) for the first decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.222" offset="13062311">It's only when they couldn't win those cases any more that they changed what they believed it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.459" offset="13083209">But the fact that this was able -- again sales and use taxes is their most expensive tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="3391.987" offset="13673368">Just a -- a few quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.439" offset="13683190">First of all, with respect to the reason why the States didn't challenge these tax exemptions earlier; for some of us it's relatively easy to remember what the price of fuel oil was back in the 1970s, it was somewhere in the sort of 10 to 30 cents a gallon range.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.032" offset="13749541">Therefore exemptions of that amount of tax, 1 percent exemption of that amount of tax is not a whole lot of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.452" offset="13775245">Today the rates are $4 a gallon, and an exemption under those circumstances, particularly when you have a fixed rate for your major competitor, gives you a more than substantial incentive to bring an action under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.946" offset="13829162">The notion that somehow the -- the State has gone down this path because of Federal law has not been true for at least 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.485" offset="13863330">That statute was repealed and Alabama could have modified its tax however it wanted to and chose not to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.590" offset="13895826">Justice Alito, your hypothetical I think is almost exactly this case, because as my friend indicated, diesel fuel is by far the biggest expense that the railroads have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.946" offset="13941175">It's also a very significant expense for the motor carriers, and it is a pretty trivial expense for everybody else in the -- in the State of Alabama.</text>

            <text syncTime="3496.304" offset="14090595">If you're doing -- you know, it would be one thing if you are just singling them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.940" offset="14101149">But it seems to me that in a statute like (b)(4), where you -- where you are more broadly, and you don't have the (b)(1) to (b)(3) baggage to deal with property taxes, the idea that you would then limit (b)(4) solely to the situation of singling out is -- is simply not a fair way to characterize it.</text>
