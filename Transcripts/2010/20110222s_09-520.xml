            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">In 1976, Congress enacted the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act, sometimes called the “4R Act,” to restore the financial stability of railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.765" offset="156463">A provision of the Act prohibits state governments from discriminating against railroads through their tax systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.711" offset="188228">The provision contains four separate prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.568" offset="203692">The first three are directed at discriminatory property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.494" offset="223441">The fourth is the one at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.910" offset="237025">It prohibits states from imposing “Another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier.”</text>
            <text syncTime="41.752" offset="272447">This case involves a challenge that's brought by a railroad, CSX to an Alabama tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.910" offset="301077">The tax is a 4% sales and use tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.869" offset="316855">Railroads pay this tax whenever they purchase or consume diesel fuel, which of course they do a lot of.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.754" offset="348411">But railroads' main competitors, motor carriers, trucks and water carriers, ships, those competitors are exempt from the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.036" offset="393550">What CSX said in this suit was that, Alabama sales and use tax was another tax that discriminated against railroads because railroads had to pay the tax, while these other entities, their competitors did not have to pay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.255" offset="458439">But the Eleventh Circuit dismissed CSX's suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.125" offset="473903">It said that the statute did not allow railroads to challenge the tax on the theory that the tax exempted other entities, and in reaching that decision, it relied on the prior decision of this Court called, ACF Industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.965" offset="537328">We held in ACF that a railroad could not challenge a property tax based on the tax exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.461" offset="571288">The Eleventh Circuit thought the same rule should apply to non-property taxes like the one in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.718" offset="600336">Today, we reversed the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.825" offset="612770">We hold that a railroad can challenge a non-property tax like this one, on the ground that the tax contains exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.339" offset="650804">We rely on the plain language of the prohibition, again, another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.246" offset="682360">First, a sales and use tax is another tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.278" offset="698556">The meaning of that phrase is very broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.804" offset="708587">There are lots of different kinds of taxes in the world as all of you taxpayers know, and this provision includes all of those taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.791" offset="748607">Second, a tax that contains exemptions can discriminate within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.301" offset="770654">Simply put, discrimination is the failure to treat people in the same way without a good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.438" offset="795209">So if one person has to pay a 4% tax and another identically situated person has to pay 2% tax, that's discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.183" offset="834184">And the same is true if the first person has to pay a 4% tax and the second person pays 0%, nothing, which is of course what an exemption is.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.233" offset="874308">That's also discrimination, it's even worse discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.582" offset="887787">So with sales and use tax that contains exemptions can be challenged as discriminatory under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.885" offset="916940">Now, all of this would be easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.294" offset="922582">It would be obvious except for the case of the Eleventh Circuit relied on ACF Industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.670" offset="948078">In that case, you'll recall, we held that a railroad could not challenge a property tax as discriminatory based on the tax exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.781" offset="984545">So a very considerable part of this opinion is devoted to explain why a different rule should apply for non-property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.462" offset="1023310">And I won't say very much about that, it's -- it's complicated but it comes down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.331" offset="1050791">The Congress drafted a set of provisions that concerned property taxes alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.987" offset="1069390">And those provisions, for whatever reason, prevent property tax exemptions from being viewed as discriminatory under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.423" offset="1103141">But those provisions have nothing to say about non-property taxes and so, we can hold and today we do hold that the sales and use tax, unlike a property tax, might discriminate because of its exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.169" offset="1162073">But one last point, we do not decide today whether Alabama's tax in fact discriminates against CSX and other railroads because it exempts their competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.192" offset="1210138">Alabama might, well have a sufficient reason to make that distinction and that is a matter for the trial court on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.814" offset="1240649">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg joins.</text>
