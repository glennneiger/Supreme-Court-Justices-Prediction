            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="7.654" offset="136088">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: By accepting Federal funds for its prisons, Texas consented to suit for appropriate relief for violations of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.795" offset="180600">The question in this case is whether that appropriate relief encompasses damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.912" offset="197110">If you simply asked what kind of relief is generally appropriate against a State, the answer would be no relief, not even an injunction, because States ordinarily are not subject even to suit without their consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.368" offset="238905">And so RLUIPA necessarily asks a more precise question, and that is what relief is appropriate against a State that has consented to be sued for violations of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.160" offset="278089">Damages, for example, are perfectly appropriate against a State that has consented to be sued for breach of contract.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="79.849" offset="424793">--In our view they are, although it's a different context, and we recognize that the government disagrees with us on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.836" offset="448721">We can't point to the Spending Clause-contract analogy that applies with respect to Spending Clause legislation as RFRA applies to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.358" offset="486860">But there are other indications, including for example the long tradition of damages being appropriate relief for the violation of civil rights.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="101.945" stopTime="109.249">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="101.945" offset="513191">Well, could we back up.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.445" offset="515176">You are saying you could get them against the Federal Government too, but the government doesn't think so?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kevin_k_russell" startTime="109.249" stopTime="152.708">
            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="109.249" offset="542448">That is our view, although we recognize that RLUIPA is different in this respect, in that it's a Spending Clause statute under which -- and this Court's decision in Barnes v. Gorman makes clear that damages are traditionally appropriate relief for the violation of any Spending Clause statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.727" offset="608277">Of course, there is also a tradition that damages are for the violation of civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.945" offset="625204">Take statutes like Title VI, Title VII, Title IX, section 504 of the ADA, the list goes on and on, where Congress has created damages as the quintessential remedy to enforce civil rights, and when Congress has subjected States to suits under such statutes, it has always put them on equal footing with other defendants and subjected them to damages as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.092" offset="705766">But even beyond that--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="152.708" offset="716215">But did it use such language as "appropriate relief"?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="156.246" stopTime="173.338">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="156.246" offset="730425">I mean, that's the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.146" offset="733978">Our cases say it has to be clear to the State when they go into one of these schemes, it has to be clear what liability they are subjecting themselves to.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.202" offset="774207">And in these other cases I think it was clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.804" offset="784656">I don't think it's clear with simply the word "appropriate relief".</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kevin_k_russell" startTime="173.338" stopTime="237.679">
            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="173.338" offset="798762">--No, we are not saying that the word "appropriate relief" in itself supplies the clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.807" offset="816630">It's looking at that language and the way the court interprets statutes generally, among other things, looking at the tradition of what constitutes appropriate relief for a violation of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.079" offset="853723">We do think that Barnes v. Gorman is appropriate precedent in telling the court -- in telling Texas what kind of relief is generally thought appropriate to satisfy Congress's desire to remedy violations of a Spending Clause statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.156" offset="914014">We recognize, of course, that Barnes didn't involve sovereign defendants, but the local governments in that case had the same rights as a State would.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.762" offset="944421">It just comes out of the Spending Clause rather than the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.214" offset="958318">That is, both constitutional provisions prohibit Congress from subjecting defendants to damages suits under Spending Clause legislation without their consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.502" offset="995412">And this Court has enforced that identical constitutional right with the same clear statement test derived from Pennhurst v. Halderman.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.723" offset="1024355">Even more, the contract analogy the Court relied on in Barnes is no less apt simply because one of the recipients is a State.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="237.679" offset="1056120">The contract analogy, I suppose, would provide that the meaning of the contract is interpreted against the drafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.851" offset="1088825">Right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kevin_k_russell" startTime="247.818" stopTime="249.887">
            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="247.818" offset="1096662">That would have been true in Barnes as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.403" offset="1107007">So to the extent the State is arguing for a restrictive interpretation, it gets at least a little help from the fact that the Federal Government wrote the statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="259.092" offset="1141802">Well, it gets the same amount of help that the local governments got in Barnes, which wasn't enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.312" offset="1158625">And Not only does the analogy, I think, apply; so does the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.114" offset="1177851">Damages are a quintessential appropriate remedy for breach of contract by a State so long as the State has agreed to be sued for violation of a contract.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="276.470" stopTime="315.412">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="276.470" offset="1211288">Mr. Russell, the State looks at this statute and says, oh, this statute preserves the PLRA, and under the PLRA there are no damages without having a physical injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.687" offset="1316195">So putting the PLRA together with PLRA is telling us it's not appropriate relief when there is no physical injury.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kevin_k_russell" startTime="315.412" stopTime="353.953">
            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="315.412" offset="1367082">Well, I would say two things about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.031" offset="1373560">One, keep in mind that the PLRA limitations only apply to incarcerated individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.983" offset="1389338">It doesn't apply to the people RLUIPA protects in State-run nursing homes or mental health facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.470" offset="1411281">So Congress wouldn't have been thinking that appropriate relief is defined in some sense by the scope of the PLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.874" offset="1436881">In addition, we think that the fact that Congress expressly said that the PLRA applies to limit the relief that's otherwise available under RLUIPA shows that Congress didn't think that the PLRA itself made the relief inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.049" offset="1497590">It's simply that there is some relief that is otherwise appropriate that will be limited in some circumstances by the PLRA.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="353.953" stopTime="360.523">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="353.953" offset="1521204">But in the prison setting, then, isn't it an academic question, because there are not going to be damages anyway?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kevin_k_russell" startTime="360.523" stopTime="401.628">
            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="360.523" offset="1547536">No, that's not true, for a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.892" offset="1556940">One, there are many cases involving pecuniary damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.558" offset="1567702">There is destruction of religious items that won't be subject to the PLRA limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.795" offset="1584630">There are -- there are cases that give rise to pecuniary claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.247" offset="1602393">So there is destruction of a religious item, a Bible or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.615" offset="1615872">There are also cases in which the violation will result in a physical injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.167" offset="1634053">There are cases where people are deprived of food for long periods of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.285" offset="1650563">There is a case where a prison refused to transport an inmate for medical treatment outside the facility because he wouldn't take off his yarmulke.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.689" offset="1676163">Congress, I don't think would have thought that the PLRA limitations rendered a damages remedy unimportant.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.593" offset="1707823">And at the very least--</text>

            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="405.913" offset="1729034">The statute, I think, does not in light of Barnes, because Barnes said that you get traditional contract remedies and punitive damages are not a traditional contract remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.470" offset="1771248">Beyond that tradition, though, there's also textual cues in the statue itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.005" offset="1793400">There are three of them that I would like to focus on.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.291" offset="1802595">I'll list them and then discuss them.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.791" offset="1808551">One is the definitions section, which lumps States in together with local governments in the definition of "government".</text>
            <text syncTime="431.028" offset="1829554">The second is the Federal enforcement provision, which specifically allows suits by the United States, but only for the equitable and declaratory relief that the State says is the only thing that's available under appropriate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.503" offset="1875425">And finally is the fact that the statute separately already authorizes suits for injunctive relief against State officials, making the addition of suits against States effectively surplusage unless some other kind of relief is available against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.727" offset="1928296">Beginning with the definitions section, this Court recognized in the United States v. Nordic Village that where Congress, in the Bankruptcy Act, defined "governmental unit" to include both the United States and a State, that Congress was making clear, quote, that</text>
            <text syncTime="470.670" offset="1988065">"States and Federal sovereigns are to be treated the same for immunity purposes. "</text>
            <text syncTime="474.724" offset="2004365">I think the same lesson comes out of the fact that RLUIPA defines "governments" to include not only States, but local governments, and subjects all governments to the same cause of action for the same appropriate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.913" offset="2045116">Congress was expressing there as clear as it could that there was a definitional equivalence between States and local government.</text>

            <text syncTime="492.602" offset="2075836">Yeah, but -- but, I mean, that means either that the Federal Government -- that the State government is liable for damages just as municipalities are, or that municipalities are immune to suit for damages just as the States are.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.128" offset="2141978">I mean, that -- you don't know which way that cuts, do you?</text>

            <text syncTime="516.082" offset="2169772">One is the fact that, as I mentioned before, the statute -- and I think the State agrees -- already allows suits for injunctive relief against State officials in their official capacity.</text>

            <text syncTime="557.723" offset="2336329">I think by defining "officials" as a form of government and authorizing suits for appropriate relief against officials, I think everybody agrees that that authorizes suits against the officials for at least injunctive relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="607.303" offset="2534651">It seems to me you couldn't sue the State legislature, so it would make sense to have an injunction against the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.514" offset="2611451">So I don't think that naming -- having a State as a defendant is necessary for that purpose here.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.786" offset="2644574">In addition, as I mentioned before, I think even the State acknowledges that damages are appropriate relief against local governments, but Congress made clear that when it intended the identity of a party to result in a dramatically different scope of relief, it did so expressly, and you can see that in the U.S. enforcement provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.581" offset="2719702">There, Congress specially authorized suits by the United States and had its own remedial provision which provides only for declaratory and injunctive relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="684.432" offset="2843105">One is Congress didn't limit that provision to suits against States.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.384" offset="2862958">It's anybody who gets sued by the United States is limited to equitable injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.002" offset="2877377">And that's, again, an example of Congress treating States the same as everybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.906" offset="2893051">Whether they are sued by the United States or sued by a private party, it is the same relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.942" offset="2909142">It's the same remedial provision and we think that suggests the same relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.477" offset="2923353">That provision also kind of -- the language of that provision, "injunctive or declaratory relief", stands in pretty stark contrast to the facially broader phrase "appropriate relief" in the general provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.117" offset="2969851">In addition to RLUIPA itself, I think it's also worth pointing out that the State had independent notice under section 2000(d)(7) -- this is the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, where Congress made clear to Texas that it would be subject to suit for damages under any statute that -- under a section of any statute that prohibits discrimination by Federal funding recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.250" offset="3066399">And I think the question here boils down to whether RLUIPA is materially distinguishable from section 504, which is listed in section 2000(d)(7) as an example of a statute prohibiting discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.576" offset="3119689">And if -- I think that means that the catch-all has to at least be broad enough to encompass section 504, and in our view, the two statutes are not distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.032" offset="3157514">Both prohibit both the kind of disparate treatment of similarly-situated individuals that the State acknowledges constitutes discrimination and requires accommodations in some circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1500.271" offset="6106530">And the Court said that the validity of Congress's constitutional action in exercising its Spending Clause authority depends on it giving the recipients of the funds clear notice of the conditions that they are agreeing to because of the contract-like nature of Spending Clause legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.733" offset="6176329">Now, that same rule was applied in Franklin and Gebser and Davis and Dole, even though the defendants in those cases were not sovereigns.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.612" offset="6247905">To be sure, the State government has more to give up.</text>

            <text syncTime="1619.345" offset="6582794">The traditional line drawing that you see in sovereign immunity is injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.797" offset="6600558">Any prospective relief is less intrusive on sovereign immunity than any form of retrospective relief, damages and that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.486" offset="6639323">But especially true in this context, because when you talk about the Spending Clause, we can walk away from injunctive relief, from an injunction at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.259" offset="6670461">We can simply stop receiving the funds and stop accepting the funds and the injunction evaporates, but we can't walk away from a damage remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.030" offset="6701495">So we are construing the express cause of action in RLUIPA, like in RFRA, to do the judicial minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.617" offset="6727931">Which is that judicial relief which requires states to do what we are already required to do, which is to comply with the substantial burden mandatory under RLUIPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.742" offset="6772339">So the fact that appropriate relief is essentially inherently ambiguous should end the analysis, because after all, the Court is required unmistakably clear text and rejected merely permissible inferences for two reasons, to ensure both careful, robust deliberation by Congress before disturbing the federal state balance of power, as well as to ensure clear notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2627.237" offset="10614324">West v. Gibson which talks about how the words appropriate relief, remedies in that context, by definition have no fixed meaning; they can't possibly have fixed meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.592" offset="10655807">So it has to enlarge or contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.044" offset="10661554">And prior to 1991 -- prior to 1991 amendment at issue in that case -- the Court would unanimously agreed that appropriate relief would not have included money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.417" offset="10703036">Ruckelshaus provides similar guidance, in that I think the phrase was, there was no possible -- no comprehensible or principled meaning to the phrase "appropriate" as attached to a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.375" offset="10750892">I will briefly touch on the 2000d-7 issue unless there are questions about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.314" offset="10782657">Assuming the issue is even preserved for this Court's consideration, 2000d-7 doesn't allow relief, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.050" offset="10809616">I think there are a lot of reasons why that would be so, but I think the simplest is simply to acknowledge the difference between section 2 of RLUIPA and section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.673" offset="10848068">Section 2 of RLUIPA is much like the four provisions expressly enumerated in 2000d-7, in that all of them have the word discrimination and more importantly turn on the concept of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.381" offset="10898954">A discrimination is an element of a cause of action under section 2, or under any of the four provisions enumerated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2707.353" offset="10934794">You can have discrimination as -- as part of your fact background if you want but it will have nothing whatsoever to do with whether have you a valid section 3 claim or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2789.702" offset="11264251">So it should be the same standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.654" offset="11276058">I -- I certainly acknowledge that when it comes to the Spending Clause as you wrote in your dissent in Davis v. Monroe, that the Spending Clause if anything does raise special constitutional considerations as a general matter, inasmuch as the Spending Clause could be used to impose Federal restrictions on States that they could never dream of under Article I otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.483" offset="11359336">RLUIPA of course is a prime example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.333" offset="11370726">But at the end of the day, the Spending Clause is not doing any work with regard to providing an assumption or presumption of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.124" offset="11409910">Again, it's exactly precisely the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.843" offset="11420776">Franklin and Barnes both articulate that it's the traditional presumption that applies to any exercise of Federal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.181" offset="11454109">That traditional presumption is what's doing the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.581" offset="11463722">The Spending Clause if anything is a cut back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.633" offset="11471976">So the notion that just invoking the Spending Clause suddenly puts States on this fabulously clear notice, I think just does not work.</text>

            <text syncTime="2862.764" offset="11556509">Nearly every argument the state made here today could have been made by the local governments in Barnes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.084" offset="11581795">Ranging from the complaint that the language like appropriate relief is too unclear, to the assertion that they were not on notice, that by accepting federal funds they were subjecting themselves to suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.225" offset="11630279">And that's because the local government, like any other state, had the same right to the same clear statement rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.593" offset="11651803">Unless this Court is, in fact, going to create a proliferation or hierarchy of clear statement rules, the Pennhurst rule that applies in the Spending Clause context of local governments applies in exactly the same way to a state government under the Eleventh Amendment and Barnes' Court construed the express private right of action under section 504, which incorporated by reference the remedies available under Title XI, which this Court construed to authorize appropriate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.910" offset="11761100">Exactly the same remedy that RLUIPA authorizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.195" offset="11778236">And so the state for the first time today has suggested that the city of Austin is not bound by Barnes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2927.198" offset="11814181">Barnes quite clearly says that the local government is subject to -- and is on notice that it has clear, there is a clear statement in every Spending Clause statute that they are subject to a damages remedy so long as they accept the funds because of the contractual nature of the obligation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="2965.304" offset="11966631">Well, the legal principle this Court adopted to resolve that issue was one that, I take it, was not just a principle for that case, but that in general, funding recipients are on notice that they are subject to contract remedies and unless this Court is going to back away from that as a general matter, unless the Court is going to say that Pennhurst applies differently in the Spending Clause context than it does in the sovereign immunity context, I don't see how you can come to a different result in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.454" offset="12079271">Justice Breyer, with respect to RFRA, as far as I know, there is only one court of appeals case that says the United States is not subject to suits and that was decided six years after RLUIPA was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.910" offset="12121067">With respect to the IDEA, there are a handful of lower courts decisions that say damages are unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.797" offset="12140607">Those -- they give reasons that are specific to the IDEA and the fact that that remedial provision is part of the due process hearing process there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.050" offset="12169655">In general, damages are the quintessential appropriate relief for violations of civil rights, and there is no reason to think that Congress was creating in RLUIPA a second class civil right that wasn't deserving of a remedy that Congress has provided even against states in every other context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.429" offset="12239141">With respect to the state's belief that the Eleventh Amendment somehow prefers injunctions over damages remedies, as counsel for the United States pointed out, the Eleventh Amendment is no basis for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.403" offset="12286997">It treats injunctions and damages as equally offensive to state sovereignty, and in fact, particularly in RLUIPA, where damages are often capped significantly by the PLRA, the concern really ought to be on the states by injunctive relief, which will frequently have a much more significant effect on the public FISC than a small damages award.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.816" offset="12364633">And finally with the state's argument that the words appropriate relief are too inherently ambiguous to meet any clear statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.720" offset="12392323">Well, this Court rejected that kind of argument in West where it construed appropriate remedy to encompass a damages remedy by engaging an ordinary statutory interpretation, which is entirely appropriate in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.480" offset="12447389">This Court has repeatedly in cases like Ruckelshaus, for example, like Richlin, relied on how statutes apply with respect to private parties to give meaning to the otherwise ambiguous word "appropriate" in the federal statute waiving the federal government's sovereign immunity.</text>
