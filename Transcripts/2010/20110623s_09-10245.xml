            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">The first case is William Freeman versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.351" offset="122817">The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 calls for sentencing guidelines to inform judicial discretion in federal sentencing, and that at issue in this case is the meaning of one statutory provision in that Act in its 18 U.S.C. Section 3582 (c) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="22.998" offset="197423">The statute permits defendants who were sentenced based on a sentencing range that has since been amended to seek a reduced to sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.256" offset="234412">The question is whether a defendant who enters into a plea agreement that recommends a particular sentence may be said to be sentenced based on the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.176" offset="278089">If so, that would make him eligible to seek 3582 relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.380" offset="298987">The petitioner in this case, William Freeman, entered into a plea agreement with the Government, and the agreement recommended a sentence of 106 months, a sentence which corresponded with the bottom of -- then applicable, crack cocaine guideline range.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.328" offset="362726">The District Court accepted the plea and entered the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.287" offset="374533">The sentencing commission later amended the crack cocaine guidelines and it made that Amendment retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.293" offset="398566">Freeman sought a sentence reduction, but the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that Freeman was sentenced based on the plea agreement rather than the guidelines so it held he is ineligible for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.464" offset="451229">Five members of the Court agreed that this judgment must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.651" offset="468052">Now, I've written the plurality opinion joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer and Kagan.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.761" offset="488427">Now, the opinion concludes that the Sixth Circuit's categorical bar finds no support in the statute or the rule governing plea agreements or in the guideline policies issued by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.824" offset="536701">In the plurality -- plurality's view in every case, the judge must exercise discretion, framed by the guidelines to impose an appropriate sentence regardless of whether the conviction is obtained by trial or by plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.620" offset="583931">Justice Sotomayor has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment but outlining a different approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.279" offset="606501">She concludes that sentence is following plea agreements that bind the District Court to impose a particular sentence, are based on the agreement rather than the guidelines but whereas here, the agreement itself ties the recommended sentence to the guideline's range that a defendant may seek 3582 relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.004" offset="677449">In this case, the petitioner is thus entitled to seek a sentence reduction under the statute, and the contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals has reversed, the Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Scalia, Thomas and Alito joined.</text>
