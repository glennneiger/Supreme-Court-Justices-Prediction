            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.776" offset="131511">The Jicarilla Apache Nation filed a breach of trust action in the Court of Federal Claims, seeking monetary damages for the Government's alleged mismanagement of the Tribe's trust funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.162" offset="181039">During discovery, the Tribe moved to compel production of certain documents and the Government asserted the attorney-client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.271" offset="213431">Court of Federal Claims granted the motion impart holding that communications relating to the management of trust funds fall within a fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.141" offset="260974">Under that exception, which courts have applied to common-law trusts, a trustee who obtains legal advice related to trust administration is precluded from asserting the attorney-client privilege against trust beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.515" offset="322414">The Government petitioned the Court of Appeals for a writ of mandamus which the Court denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.151" offset="341013">The Court of Appeals held that the trust relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes is sufficiently similar to a private trust to justify applying the fiduciary exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.367" offset="389914">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.390" offset="393989">The analogy between the Government and a private trustee cannot be taken too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.643" offset="418962">The Government's trust obligations to the Tribes are governed by a statute, not the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.852" offset="443831">In fulfilling in statutory duties, the Government acts not as a private trustee but pursuant to its sovereign interest in the execution of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.186" offset="481134">The two criteria, justifying the fiduciary exception, are therefore absent in the context of this trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.249" offset="513421">Because its sovereign interest is distinct from the beneficiaries' private interest, the Government seeks legal advice in its own rather than a fiduciary capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.376" offset="553859">In this case, the relevant statute delineates specific disclosure obligations of the Government to the Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.843" offset="579772">Common law does not override the specific trust-creating statute and regulations that apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.822" offset="607671">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.678" offset="631077">Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Breyer has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.772" offset="655527">Justice Sotomayor has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.756" offset="667439">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
