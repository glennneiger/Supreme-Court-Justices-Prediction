            <text syncTime="10.681" offset="149128">Formality is indeed essential to testimonial utterance.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.210" offset="163234">So said this Court in Davis, which dealt with two related situations: On-the-scene questioning by police officers and questions by 9-1-1 operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.629" offset="196984">This Court noted that such questioning may often lack the formality essential to testimonial utterance, as officers called to investigate need to know whom they are dealing with in order to assess a situation, the threat to themselves, and the potential danger to possible victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.326" offset="263753">The question here is whether those same assessing questions -- "what happened", "who did it", "where did it happen" -- asked by police officers who, upon receiving a radio report of a man shot, found a wounded man lying on the ground next to a car at a gas station, bleeding, visibly in pain and having trouble talking -- were made in a formal context sufficiently similar to a magisterial examination so that the answers by the dying -- by the dying victim are testimonial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1531.090" offset="6230852">But this Court rejected that argument, because it understood, I think quite rightly, that there is a difference between providing that sort of information to law enforcement with a sort of vague awareness that that might be its potential use, and doing so with the kind of focused understanding that has been characteristic of the testimonial statements this Court has so far identified, like Sylvia Crawford's station house interview in Crawford or Amy Hammon's interview with the police officer from the safety of her kitchen that resulted in the execution of a formal affidavit in the Davis case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.430" offset="6704191">I think that in examining the exigencies of a situation a court would be justified in looking at the circumstances in which the crime occurred, and could very well take into account the fact that the crime occurred at 3:00 in the morning as opposed to 5:00 in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.891" offset="6766049">But I think that we would expect any reasonable police officer to do precisely what the police officers in this case did, which is proceed directly to the scene, not use their interview with Anthony Covington as an occasion to execute an affidavit or otherwise--</text>
