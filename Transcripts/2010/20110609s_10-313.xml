            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">The -- this case has come to us on a writ of certio -- on writs of certiorari to the United States -- from the United States Court of Appeal for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.443" offset="143193">The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires incumbent local telephone providers like -- or such us respondent AT&amp;T to share certain parts of their physical networks with competitors at cost-based prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.146" offset="214037">This case concerns an incumbent's obligation to lease entrance facilities which are typically wires or cables that connect to networks.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.235" offset="262311">Entrance facilities can be used for two different purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.994" offset="277358">One is called "backhauling" and the other is called "interconnection".</text>
            <text syncTime="49.002" offset="301390">The FCC recently decided that incumbent local telephone providers are not required to lease entrance facilities for backhauling.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.720" offset="344336">It emphasized however, that it was not changing incumbent's existing obligation to provide facilities necessary for interconnection.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.862" offset="392819">After the FCC's decision, AT&amp;T notified its competitors that it would no longer provide entrance facilities at cost-based prices for either backhauling or interconnection.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.676" offset="460110">The competitors argued that AT&amp;T was violating its duty to provide interconnection.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.410" offset="491039">The District Court ruled that AT&amp;T -- ruled for AT&amp;T and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.596" offset="531790">In an opinion filed with the clerk today we reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals because no statute or regulation expressly addresses AT&amp;T's obligation to lease its entrance facilities, we look to the FCC's interpretation of its regulations in its amicus brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.603" offset="623846">The FCC argues that an incumbent must lease existing entrance facilities to competitors at cost-based rates if the facilities are to be used for interconnection.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.248" offset="678390">We find the FCC's interpretation reasonable and defer to that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.217" offset="706288">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.943" offset="717155">Justice Scalia has filed the concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.096" offset="729799">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</text>
