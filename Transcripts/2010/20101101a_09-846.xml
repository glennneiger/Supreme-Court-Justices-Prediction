            <text syncTime="8.856" offset="140894">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.808" offset="152701">This Court in Keene held that section 1500 of Title 28 deprives the Court Of Federal Claims has jurisdiction when the plaintiff has a pending suit in another court based on substantially the same operative facts and left open the question whether some overlap in the relief requested is also necessary to trigger that bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.102" offset="229815">The Federal Circuit erred in holding that section 1500 applies when both suits -- only when both suits seek the same relief, and that the critical distinction in this regard is whether the particular relief in the plaintiff's plea for relief is deemed legal or equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.314" offset="294703">Section 1500's text broadly bars CFC jurisdiction whenever any suit that the plaintiff has pending in any other court is a suit for the CFC claim or is merely a suit in respect to that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.656" offset="356039">In other words, another suit for a different but a related claim will trigger section 1500.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.910" offset="381012">That provision was intended to protect the government from simultaneous duplicative suits against the United States and its agents by forcing plaintiffs to elect between those related suits.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="80.535" offset="427510">But you recognize that sequential suits could be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.987" offset="445377">So that if the case in the district court went to final judgment, then it would be okay to go to the Court Of Federal Claims.</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony Yang</label>
            <text syncTime="99.247" offset="502429">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.699" offset="508176">In some, in perhaps a good number of cases, it's possible to, if you are seasonably prompt in your Court Of Federal Claims case or your district court case first--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="112.173" offset="554151">But you don't have control over how long the district court case is going to take, and there is no mechanism to stop the running of the statute of limitations.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_yang" startTime="124.314" stopTime="268.956">
            <label>Mr. Anthony Yang</label>
            <text syncTime="124.314" offset="602634">--Well, I think there is some control that you can exercise over the -- how promptly the suit proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.635" offset="627921">Particularly if we are talking about suits against the government, many suits proceed on an administrative record and go directly to summary judgment; that can be done in a relatively prompt manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.824" offset="664701">But even if not, the Congress that enacted section 1500 in 1868 knew that essentially what it was doing in many, many cases would prevent a second suit from going forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.398" offset="710990">That's because the Congress was concerned with the cotton claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.083" offset="729799">The cotton claimants had authorization to bring suit in the Court of Claims, but there was a two-year statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.939" offset="757175">That statute ran from the end of the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.391" offset="766997">And this Court in a case called U.S. v. Anderson at 76 U.S., and the relevant pages are 70 to 71, made clear that the end of the Civil War for the purposes of that statute was August in 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.401" offset="826974">Congress enacted section 1500 in June of 1868.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.869" offset="844946">There was a two-month window, if that, to bring suit and Congress recognized, it would have recognized, that if you filed suit or were forced to elect at that point, that would be the end of the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.577" offset="887683">There was also another statutory provision that Congress enacted during the Civil War that put a two-year statute of limitations on suits against officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.116" offset="921851">That was discussed in this Court's decision, Mitchell v. Clark, 110 U.S. 633 at pages 641 and 642.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.520" offset="955496">So given the time at which Congress was enacting section 1500, it knew it was putting plaintiffs to a very hard choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.161" offset="994053">You had to elect between the Court Of Federal Claims remedy and between a remedy in another court against an officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.914" offset="1021116">That remedy would likely be the end of the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.766" offset="1032505">And Congress did that in a very particular way.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.135" offset="1041910">It did it in a targeted statute that limited the authority of the court that had its hands on the purse strings of the Federal Government, and that performed the very function that Congress just a few years earlier had itself exercised through the enactment of private bills through its appropriations power.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.395" offset="1107007">So section 1500 ultimately states in essence that if you are going to bring suit in this specialized court where Congress has vested the Court of Claims with the very special power of distributing money from the Federal fisc, that you could only bring one suit arising from the same operative facts in order to be in that court.</text>

            <text syncTime="295.626" offset="1287879">Why isn't our view of 1500 just simply you can't have two suits that are seeking the same pot?</text>

            <text syncTime="307.516" offset="1335526">The Abandoned and -- Abandoned Property Collection Act -- we will call it APCA -- provided for a special statutory trust remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.205" offset="1378262">That remedy was for the net proceeds of anything -- any -- any auction sales that might have resulted from cotton.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.911" offset="1413057">If the cotton was lost, it was damaged, it was destroyed, if the proceeds were paid but ultimately didn't make their way into the fisc, you got nothing or you got a substantially reduced fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.071" offset="1465720">If you sued in court, you might be able to sue, as we explained in our reply brief, under certain doctrines that would give you the property in specie, or you could seek monetary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.212" offset="1514308">These are quite different things.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.797" offset="1532594">I mean, that's I think Justice Sotomayor's point, about duplication.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.870" offset="1560910">It's not -- even if you can say, yes, it's a different mode of relief, but you could -- couldn't get -- I mean, suppose we didn't have 1500 and you prevailed in your suit on the APCA or whatever you call the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.182" offset="1642099">You could not then turn around and sue the government official, because you have the -- the single claim, you've been compensated.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.041" offset="1701554">I mean, one suit is not precluded by the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.328" offset="1714719">You -- you recognize that by saying you could bring the Claims Court suit after the district court suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.767" offset="1756515">That's not so in -- in the cotton cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="415.219" offset="1766337">--You may in certain instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.838" offset="1776786">But particularly in the cotton cases, Congress knew that it -- what it was doing was forcing one path and only one path.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.944" offset="1809178">It wasn't about duplicative recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.561" offset="1815656">You had to choose and you not -- you weren't going to have time to bring another suit, and Congress would have known that when it enacted the section 1500's predecessor two months before the statute ran in APCA and perhaps after the statute ran for bringing a tort suit against officials under the cases -- the statute that this Court construed in Mitchell.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.624" offset="1895905">So it wasn't simply that duplicative relief was at issue, Congress was actually forcing you to make a choice in cases where the types of relief are quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.146" offset="1938014">And the type of relief, for instance, that you would get in a suit against an agent of the United States, what you get out of that suit is not a pot of money; the court does not say at the end of the case, here you go, you asked for $1,000, here it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.757" offset="2000499">The court enters an order; it enters a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.893" offset="2013038">It says,</text>
            <text syncTime="477.576" offset="2015754">"Defendant, perhaps Tony Yang, officer of the government, you pay $100 million, $50 million. "</text>
            <text syncTime="484.899" offset="2045012">It doesn't mean much to the plaintiff if they get at Tony Yang as an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.684" offset="2068208">This is very different relief than a money judgment against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.236" offset="2086390">It's not the same relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.588" offset="2091823">And in fact, we don't normally think of a claim as embodying a particular type of relief, which is the submission of the trial here.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.396" offset="2255036">The -- I'm not sure that there was an instance of this happening because of section 1500's existence, but if you had, for instance, obtained damages against an individual agent in a suit and you still could have brought suit within the Abandoned -- Abandoned Property Collection Act, the Abandoned Collection Property Act provided a statutory trust for the owner of the cotton.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.880" offset="2360989">It's not at all clear that that would have been precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.332" offset="2374781">There may well have been, but for the statute of limitations problem, the ability to get a double recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.621" offset="2407905">But nevertheless, I mean, our submission ultimately turns on our understanding of the text of this statute, which is quite broad.</text>

            <text syncTime="1560.440" offset="6347170">Two suits are for or in respect to the same claim under Section 1500, only if they stem from the same operative facts and seek duplicative relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.866" offset="6400878">And in response to the Government's argument, I would like to explain why that's the best reading of Section 1500's text, as well as the only reading that harmonizes Section 1500 with the overall jurisdictional and remedial scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.376" offset="6462945">Congress has made a broad range of remedies available to Plaintiffs wronged by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.613" offset="6487918">And it's directed Plaintiffs to seek certain remedies only in the Court of Federal Claims, and certain remedies only in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.552" offset="6527624">The Government's reading of Section 1500 assumes that Congress intended to penalize Plaintiffs for following that direction by barring them from the only forum where they can obtain money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.959" offset="6577256">But nothing in the statute's text or history suggests that Congress intended to create such a nonsensical scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.181" offset="6702122">And so in a way we are resolving a very strange question, that is if as is not clear, you have a right to sue in the district courts for an injunction, can that suit proceed because of 1500 when there is a suit pending in the Court of Claims and that is sort of an abstract question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3098.063" offset="12497648">And what this Court has said, though, is that even if it's not a completely full substitute -- even if, say, the damages sought in one court are less than the damages sought in another -- if they are duplicative relief for the same injury, they are barred by section 1500.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.744" offset="12584375">And I think that is completely consistent with the holding in Keene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.013" offset="12597436">In Keene, the plaintiff was bringing multiple suits against the United States in different courts for duplicative relief, money, and compensation for funds it had paid out to asbestos claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.057" offset="12657622">And notwithstanding the fact that it brought some of those suits on a contract theory and some of those suits on an equitable tort theory of indemnification, the statute barred those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.900" offset="12721048">But Keene was not faced with a situation in which the plaintiffs were forced, as in Casman, to proceed in two different courts to obtain different relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.356" offset="12762843">And another particularly good example is an example of a regulatory taking suit, in which if a plaintiff wants to challenge the legality of government regulation affecting his property, he needs to do that in the district court under the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.983" offset="12837345">And according to the government, he cannot bring a suit for just compensation in the Court of Federal Claims until that district court suit is completed and any appeal is completed and any cert petition is completed, by which time the six-year statute of limitations on the just compensation claim may very well have expired.</text>

            <text syncTime="3245.458" offset="13087284">I mean, it's as if in Casman, Casman had been told, well, you know, first get reinstated -- I'm sorry -- first get your backpay; then go get reinstated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3261.734" offset="13152381">In addition, if it were the case that the accounting uncovered additional mismanagement, this statute of limitations, the six-year statute of limitations might well expire while the district court suit for an accounting is pending, those suits tend to last a very long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.830" offset="13244750">Indeed in the Indian Claims Commission they have been known to last for up to 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.234" offset="13266380">And it would force the Nation to run the risk of losing its right to damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="3326.926" offset="13413083">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.842" offset="13420816">The Tribe is unable to identify a textual basis for its same relief defense to the court of federal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.282" offset="13454566">If it's definition of claim is as narrow and circumscribed as it defines, it wouldn't capture the cotton claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.820" offset="13484659">Moreover, putting aside the definition of claim, the statute applies when there is a pending suit or process in another court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.993" offset="13521439">That is not only for the claim, but in respect to the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.028" offset="13533560">That substantially broadens the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.761" offset="13540456">Two, there are two problems with the same relief test that's as a practical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.782" offset="13564594">In order to determine whether the same relief is being sought in the other court, which is the relevant question under their test, you have to ask, what relief would be sought in district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.007" offset="13605449">But Rule 54(c) makes clear that the relief which is available in district court is not specified by the complaint, it's whatever develops through the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.715" offset="13648290">So you might not know until the very end whether duplicative relief is being sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.916" offset="13665113">Secondly, if you are going to limit the relief that is available in the district court based on what the court of claims' view is of the district court's jurisdiction to issue relief, you are inviting the court of federal claims and the federal circuit to be opining on the jurisdiction of the district court under the APA, in very complicated cases which involve questions of Bowen, Utah Wilderness, this is not the way that you would construe normally a jurisdictional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.352" offset="13786843">The specter of 50-year old suits proceeding simultaneously in the court of federal claims in district court certainly would have motivated, or spoken to the Congress that enacted Section 1500's predecessor in 1868.</text>

            <text syncTime="3454.007" offset="13921426">There are differences in terms of the procedure and what is a relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.061" offset="13937622">The other you would have to show that there was some kind of a breach and you get a full kind of accounting to quantify damages that relate -- in aid of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.833" offset="13976701">But at the end of the day, the example, losing $10 and you collect 20 but only debit -- put 10 on the books, that is a claim which is cognizable in the court of federal claims if they have a money mandating statute of regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3505.208" offset="14126226">They do not proceed on dual tracks where the very premise of liability in the court of federal claims is being litigated in district court, or they are seeking to challenge, you know, an accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.163" offset="14166037">Accounting normally would be, you know, here's an account of your -- your assets, but they're seeking to challenge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.634" offset="14195921">If you went back to equity, for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.269" offset="14206474">A trustee does, as an equitable matter, have a duty to account when requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.554" offset="14223611">But the cost of the accounting is taken out of the trust corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.273" offset="14238553">That's not what is going on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.891" offset="14245031">They are trying to seek to use the APA to force something which we don't think is authorized under statute as a secondary means of discovery for the same claims that are at issue in the court of federal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.949" offset="14297172">That type of duplicative litigation and the burden on the federal courts is precisely what Section 1500 was intended to prevent against, and in the absence of a textual basis for the same relief test that the court of federal claims or federal circuit adopted here I think is fatal to the case.</text>
