            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-525, Janus Capital Group v. First Derivative Traders.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.745" offset="137425">Mr. Perry.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark A. Perry</label>
            <text syncTime="8.759" offset="141500">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.805" offset="161667">Affirming the judgment below would authorize private securities fraud class actions against every service provider that participates in the drafting of a public company's prospectus.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.752" offset="217464">It is therefore nothing less than a frontal assault on this Court's decisions in Central Bank and Stoneridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.622" offset="248916">In those cases, Your Honors, this Court held that service providers may not be sued primarily in private class actions and left that matter for Congress to resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.806" offset="293637">And Congress did respond, not once, not twice, but three times, to those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.851" offset="313804">First, in the PSLRA, the Congress authorized a Federal action, a government action, only against aiders and abettors, leaving the question of private class actions for this Court's resolution.</text>

            <text syncTime="69.797" offset="385588">Not in the complaint, but in the briefs?</text>
            <text syncTime="72.733" offset="397396">As I read the briefs, they claim that Janus itself did not make the false statement, that the two appellants did, that they are the actual speakers because they were talking about their activities, and they used Janus as a conduit to deceive the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.345" offset="511812">That's, I think, what they're alleging.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="112.153" offset="555071">So how do we sustain the intermediary cases when the company, through market analysts, divulges misleading statements?</text>
            <text syncTime="122.479" offset="596344">We don't talk about the market analysts' falsity; we talk about the company's falsity, because the market analysts didn't have scienter.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark A. Perry</label>
            <text syncTime="132.038" offset="634587">Your Honor, the company -- excuse me -- the conduit or analyst cases fall under two categories, neither of which is met here.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.832" offset="657784">First, they are a scheme between the company -- orchestrated by the company to distribute its information through the analysts to the market, and they are brought under 10b-5(a) as scheme cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.107" offset="706894">That is most of the analyst cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.014" offset="714522">There is no 10b-5(a) claim in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.779" offset="725598">This is only a 10b-5(b)-making claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.903" offset="738032">Second, those few cases, the analyst cases that are brought under (b), involve an admission; that is, the company has failed to correct a statement made by an analyst where there is a duty to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.445" offset="784217">There is no omission claim in this case because there is no duty--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="172.865" offset="797905">Well, what's the difference between an omission or a commission if a company purposely divulges a falsehood to an analyst, knowing it's going to be distributed and told?</text>
            <text syncTime="184.532" offset="844612">So who is making the false statement, the analyst or the company?</text>

            <text syncTime="190.089" offset="866764">Under basic, the analyst is the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.354" offset="875854">It is the ears of the market that takes the information.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="195.197" offset="887244">So why isn't -- why aren't the two appellants, on their theory, on -- we can talk about whether the complaint does or does not adequately allege their theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.397" offset="924024">That's a different issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.286" offset="927577">I accept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.163" offset="931129">But under their theory, why isn't the appellants the primary violator, not even a secondary?</text>
            <text syncTime="213.861" offset="961849">Because they -- they claim, I think -- and I'm going to find out from them -- that Janus had no scienter, that it didn't make the false statements, that all of this was done in secret by the appellants, so they were the only violator.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.834" offset="1221820">In fact, the Court's questions go to the distinction between primary and secondary liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.256" offset="1239479">But I -- but if Janus had no scienter, if its board of directors did not know that the statements were false, they had no way of knowing, because as I understand the complaint, and this is alleged, the deal was secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.500" offset="1300396">So Janus itself could not be a primary violator.</text>

            <text syncTime="3301.571" offset="13312752">Is there a way to confine our holding just to the mutual fund situation, and if there is, how would you do that?</text>

            <text syncTime="3309.772" offset="13345562">Well, I think the easiest way would be to analogize it to the cases involving corporate employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.751" offset="13365415">As Petitioners acknowledge, there are cases where a corporate employee drafts a statement that's issued in the company's name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.392" offset="13384014">In this instance the investment advisor is management for the company, and the fact that they happen to be management by virtue of contract rather than just the internal arrangements of the corporation shouldn't change that arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.824" offset="13429781">It -- it's also the case that if the Court were -- were looking for a way to narrow its holding, it could do so by talking about the elements of the 10b-5 cause of action, which -- which would apply only to private suits and -- and not to enforcement actions brought by the Commission or by the Department of Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3468.002" offset="13978457">You notice 20(b) does not require a primary violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.985" offset="13990369">It allows the Commission to proceed directly against any person who acts indirectly where it can't act directly.</text>
