            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.469" offset="131281">Candidates for Federal Civ -- Civil Service have long been required to undergo a standard employment background check.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.045" offset="165554">Several years ago, the Government extended this requirement to federal contract employees who require long-term access to Government facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.428" offset="203170">The respondents in this case who were the plaintiffs below are Government contract employees at a NASA laboratory, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.039" offset="245593">They challenged two aspects of the Government background check.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.187" offset="262207">Their first challenge concerns a question on the standard form that asks employees about any treatment or counseling that they have received for recent illegal drug use.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.925" offset="309123">The second concerns a series of open-ended questions on a form that the Government sends to the employees designated references.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.493" offset="343395">The respondent's claim that this inquires violate a constitutional right to informational privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.231" offset="370354">The Court has considered similar arguments in two other cases, Whalen versus Roe and Nixon versus Administrator of General Services both decided in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.513" offset="419464">In both of those cases, the plaintiffs claimed that the Government's collection of their personal information violated the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.977" offset="453319">This Court rejected those arguments, however, because the practices at issue were reasonable and because the information collected was subject to protection against the public disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.792" offset="496577">We take the same approach in this case that the Court took in Whalen and Nixon.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.989" offset="517371">We assume without deciding that the Constitution protects some right to informational privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.188" offset="542135">We hold, however, that the challenged portions of the Government's background investigation do not violate such a right in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.339" offset="574736">These inquiries are reasonable and they further the Government's interest in managing its internal operations and responses to the challenge, inquiries are shielded from public disclosure by the Privacy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.469" offset="627294">Those protections are sufficient to satisfy any privacy interest that may arguably be rooted in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.243" offset="658432">We reversed the Court of Appeals' contrary judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.615" offset="679852">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.015" offset="701482">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.223" offset="718305">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
