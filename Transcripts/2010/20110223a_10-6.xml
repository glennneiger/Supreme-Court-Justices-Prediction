            <text syncTime="3294.069" offset="13282764">Number two, the jury charge that was sent to the jury was more than sufficient under any of these standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.389" offset="13308050">But number three, the alternative argument we made, there was a finding of direct infringement.</text>
