            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1163, Milner v. The Department of the Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.737" offset="136401">Mr. Mann.</text>

            <label>Mr. David S. Mann</label>
            <text syncTime="8.704" offset="140267">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.289" offset="150612">There are four points I would like to make this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.891" offset="160956">First, the plain language of Exemption 2 dictates an extremely narrow category of materials, those related solely to internal personnel policies and rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.381" offset="202961">Second, even if you look beyond the plain language and look to the legislative history, the legislative history is focused, and the additional legislative history from the House is focused, only on law enforcement or investigatory materials, items that were covered through the 1986 amendments to FOIA, making any additional judicial High 2 unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.831" offset="300763">The third point: Because of FOIA's purpose, if you find that the language, the plain language, is not clear or if you find that the legislative history isn't sufficient, then the focus must be on an interpretation that supports disclosure, not secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.673" offset="364084">And finally, Congress in enacting FOIA conducted the balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.744" offset="388430">It reserved for it, itself, the authority to add to or expand FOIA through Exemption 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.702" offset="424270">It did not leave agency discretion available for the agencies to decide what documents they can provide or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.939" offset="453214">Moving into our first argument, the plain language.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.343" offset="474843">At issue is a very short sentence related solely to internal personnel rules and procedures -- and rules and practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.650" offset="524058">Congress chose to use the words "related solely" on purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.173" offset="558122">That's an extremely narrow view.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.208" offset="570243">Now, we understand if you look at the words in isolation, perhaps you could see that there is some conflict between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.212" offset="598246">"Related" could be broad, "solely" is extremely narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.331" offset="610785">But when read together, as they should be in this statute, "related solely" is an extremely narrow class of documents.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="135.003" stopTime="168.407">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="135.003" offset="645475">Could I ask you this.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.789" offset="648610">The D.C. Circuit's decision in Crooker has been the leading decision in this -- on this issue for nearly 30 years and there has been a great deal of reliance on it, certainly by the lower courts in general, and perhaps also by Congress and by the Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.868" offset="732933">Do you think there is anything to be said for deference to that decision based on the fact that it has been -- there has been reliance on it to such a great degree for such a period of time?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_s_mann" startTime="168.407" stopTime="203.479">
            <label>Mr. David S. Mann</label>
            <text syncTime="168.407" offset="779013">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.759" offset="788417">When Crooker came down, the Court was faced with an extremely -- a circumstance dealing with these FBI or ATF search and seizure manuals, and the Court adopted and created the High 2 exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.470" offset="851320">But again, we believe in 1986 Congress dealt with that expressly, explicitly, and took the exact same language and inserted it into a stand-alone exemption, Exemption 7(A), making Crooker no longer needed or necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.313" offset="914641">In the past the Court--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="203.479" offset="919343">I ask -- I ask the question because the world has changed in a lot of ways since 1981, and one is that there is now I think much greater concern about the disclosure of information that has perhaps profound security implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.906" offset="985067">That was not as much of a concern in -- in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.976" offset="1005338">If you think about, for example, suppose there is a Federal building with a hallway that is accessible only to somebody who has a code key.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.467" offset="1047239">Would that be -- is that -- does that have to be disclosed under FOIA?</text>
            <text syncTime="240.854" offset="1068868">Or architectural plans for a Federal building that would disclose the size of the bomb that would be necessary to bring the building down or bring part of the building down; is there any FOIA exemption that covers things like that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_s_mann" startTime="256.464" stopTime="292.554">
            <label>Mr. David S. Mann</label>
            <text syncTime="256.464" offset="1131248">--Well, Your Honor, there could be a variety of FOIA exemptions that could fit under 7 depending on whether or not it's law enforcement-related.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.903" offset="1164999">For example, if it's FBI instructions on guarding a facility or guarding individuals, perhaps that would be law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.073" offset="1193733">And if it's protecting individuals within that building, under 7(F).</text>
            <text syncTime="275.675" offset="1208153">Or it could be something addressed specifically through Exemption 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.663" offset="1224035">And coming to your original -- the original part of your question, that times have changed, we recognize that; and Congress recognized certainly that times could and would change when it adopted it; and that's why we believe Congress kept for itself Exemption 3.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.687" offset="1284117">--Even though you -- you said that -- about Exemption 7, the amendment to that, so you don't need 2, you still -- as far as I know every court of appeals that has weighed in has accepted Crooker.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.349" offset="1354856">And I was a little puzzled why you were so intent on rejecting so-called High 2, because after all, in this very case, Judge Fletcher dissenting to, but he said he accepts Crooker, he accepts High 2, and he still thinks you win, so you don't need to reject Crooker to prevail.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="342.737" offset="1476378">We don't need to project -- under Judge Fletcher's viewpoint, we did not need to reject High 2 to prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.074" offset="1505740">But again, he was the dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.009" offset="1517443">But more importantly, Crooker -- again we think this language -- this case rises and falls on the plain language of the statute, and Crooker was an expansion to that, and we need to accept that Crooker was an expansion of that, and Congress accepted that it was an expansion when they came up with 7(E).</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="376.041" offset="1609603">I mean, if Crooker was interpreting section 2, that was the interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.862" offset="1636874">If everyone had followed it, every court, nobody disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.397" offset="1650981">All your four arguments Judge Edwards went into thoroughly.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.116" offset="1665923">Everyone but Judge Wilkie approved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.984" offset="1677312">And so Congress reads that, and they make it specific in 7 but they say nothing about 2.</text>

            <label>Mr. David S. Mann</label>
            <text syncTime="398.704" offset="1700195">--I think there are three points to look at on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.489" offset="1711376">First of all, Congress originally did look at amending section 2 -- Exemption 2, at the same time they looked at amending Exemption 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.909" offset="1745021">They chose not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.761" offset="1748470">Now, we don't -- we can't read everything into that, but they chose not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.880" offset="1760904">They made 7 specifically and 7 covered all of the language that we would be looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.617" offset="1783892">So really, if you are still reading Exemption 2 to include a High 2, then 7(E) becomes superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.538" offset="1811581">And then a final point and I think a very important point--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="429.557" offset="1823598">Well, you get a different Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.590" offset="1827777">I mean, the Congress that passed the law is not necessarily the same Congress that failed to amend the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.629" offset="1863931">Are we to consider laws to be in effect only for so long as the Congress that passed them is sitting, and then the failure to make any changes in light of judicial decisions by later Congresses effectively amends the law?</text>

            <text syncTime="462.942" offset="1957240">The proposition I am making is that when in 1984, '84 to '86, took place and looked at this, and as they saw the issue of Jordan and they saw the issue of Crooker, their decision was to consolidate that decision, what had been called 2&gt; ["], into 7(E).</text>

            <text syncTime="484.308" offset="2042608">7 E says we want to be sure something like Crooker's interpretation of 2 applies for law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.461" offset="2071239">It's simply a case -- so they apply it with law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.246" offset="2086390">Absolutely now it's guaranteed.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.115" offset="2093913">Crooker is not guaranteed because it could be overturned.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.702" offset="2116274">But what in that suggests they don't want Crooker to apply to the Fed for example, or to the Navy, which is here storing -- it's here storing explosives.</text>

            <text syncTime="837.411" offset="3455101">As we point out -- as we set out for you in our briefs, if you look at the legislative history, many of the agencies and Department of Justice that came before Congress asked for that discretion, and Congress did not give it to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.985" offset="3505361">They reserved and instead we have Exemption 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.187" offset="3518213">So what we're saying is that you do not need to -- there may be reasons that you want to take high security information and have it isolated from the public's review, but it's not through using an exemption that was really designed for minor internal matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2444.229" offset="9882373">Well, there were -- I can give you a few examples from the legislative history, for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.681" offset="9900136">One of the problems that Congress was concerned with is that the old exemption, exemption in section 3, had been construed to apply to internal management, including things such as phone books, agency phone books for personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.690" offset="9960218">That would no longer be encompassed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.408" offset="9975056">Things like budgets that the agency produces, that arguably would be internal management, that would not be under the internal personnel rules and practices of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.550" offset="10019568">And I think it's important to remember that when Congress drafted this statute, it initially started with internal personnel -- or excuse me, internal employment rules and practices and changed that to personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.989" offset="10065335">In the report that effectuated that change, the explanation and the only explanation was that that change was similar -- made the exemption similar but more tightly drawn than the APA's management exemption, which at the time existed in another part of the statute; there was a cross-reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.235" offset="10138373">When Congress then continued to revise the statute, the House made very clear in the hearings, in the House Report and on the floor that its intent was to cover these types of rules and manuals and instructions to agency personnel when doing so would risk the functions that are at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.781" offset="10208590">And when Congress in 1986 amended FOIA by adding -- or amending Exemption 7 E, it ratified the existing rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.902" offset="10249028">And it did so because -- it ratified it and it had to -- it extended it in two important ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.489" offset="10279330">Crooker left open the question or at least made it vague as to whether prosecution guidelines would be protected by Exemption 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.630" offset="10323947">The reason that was unclear is because the D.C. Circuit had previously concluded in Jordan that Exemption 2 did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.470" offset="10359265">Crooker rejected all of Jordan 's rationale but the someone enigmatically said, but we would reach the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.374" offset="10386954">Justice Ginsburg's concurrence explained in Crooker that this muddied the waters, and when Congress revisited FOIA and Exemption 7(E), it specifically provided an exemption for law enforcement investigations and prosecutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3400.800" offset="13708581">The one open-ended one is the one that Congress kept for itself, Exemption 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.823" offset="13732718">If the Navy doesn't believe that these documents can be or should be classified, but the Navy doesn't want to release these documents for some reason, then the Navy's recourse is to go to Congress as other agencies have done and seek a special protection for these documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.868" offset="13808891">But it's not to distort the words "personnel practices and rules" to expand to every document that is used by personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.139" offset="13849955">And that is precisely what the Navy is asking for on page 51 of their brief and we responded to it in our reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.877" offset="13876914">They are looking for an exemption that covers a wide range of information concerning internal rules and practices where disclosure would risk circumvention and where other FOIA exemptions are unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.785" offset="13924561">They are asking you to create for them what they -- what Congress wouldn't give them in 1964 or '66, broad discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.159" offset="13966043">And it doesn't belong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.325" offset="13970745">It certainly doesn't belong under the very narrow Exemption 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.711" offset="13988300">If there are no other questions, I am complete.</text>
