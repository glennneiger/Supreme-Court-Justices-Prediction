            <text syncTime="395.269" offset="1686507">To the first question, Your Honor, even as of 1950, the drafters recognized that this was a fully appropriated river; it had reached its maximum practical limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.708" offset="1724228">So each individual downstream knows how much water they should be getting.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.112" offset="1745857">I mean, we have 80 years of measurements on one of these rivers alone, and you could go online right now and find out what the flow is at the State line occurring as of this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.353" offset="1794863">So a piece of it that this is something we have been doing for a long time in the West as far as knowing what water is in the river, where it is, and throughout, you know, downstream appropriation.</text>

            <text syncTime="445.016" offset="1885456">Now -- then the question is have the senior appropriators or the upstream appropriators reduced it in a way that's inconsistent or that's an overuse of their beneficial rights, and you're right -- again right where we started from.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.490" offset="1935402">And then you have to regulate exactly how each irrigator is using the appropriative rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="3560.952" offset="14349208">Briefly, as Justice Scalia pointed out this is a compact, and it's a compact between two different States, and Montana gave up things, a right of priority administration across State lines as a result of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.294" offset="14402602">Justice Breyer, as an issue of fairness, we don't get all the water.</text>

            <text syncTime="3582.382" offset="14434994">We are now the downstream appropriator, so -- but one example, if half the water is flowing now that it was, as of 1950, Montana may not get anything at that point, because just by the virtue of some say it's "highology", whoever is higher on the river gets to take first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.927" offset="14505106">So we -- we don't get to fulfill our rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.814" offset="14520675">All we get is to ensure that given a like supply of water, that our rights shall continue to be enjoyed as it existed as of 1950.</text>

            <text syncTime="3631.615" offset="14631852">That's what the hydraulics and the engineers will ultimately determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.250" offset="14646376">We made calls in 2004 and 2006.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.035" offset="14657557">We said, wait a minute, we're not getting enough water here, and we believe it's the -- the pre-1950 uses that are depleting that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.308" offset="14686605">Will you give us water?</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.725" offset="14692352">Ultimately why we're here is to sort this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.193" offset="14706145">I guess, I would also point out that there was some discussion about an appropriative right is the right to use a quantity of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.532" offset="14731536">That makes sense other than if you're in a compact, and Montana gets no water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.750" offset="14752434">The Solicitor General even pointed out then in his brief at a footnote; he said well, what we might do, then, is that Montana could bring an equitable apportionment action for the pre-1950 water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.427" offset="14811157">That highlights the, I think to me, the illogic of just focusing on the rights and not looking at the uses and how much each State was consuming, because at that point I'll be right back here saying we want the same water under like conditions that we had in 1950.</text>
