            <text syncTime="11.172" offset="150089">The question presented is how to interpret a since-amended version of Regulation Z.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.795" offset="176630">In amicus briefs filed, solicited by the First Circuit and by this Court, the Federal Reserve Board has confirmed that it has long interpreted its regulation just as Chase Bank and the rest of the regulated credit card industry understood.</text>

          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="37.923" stopTime="120.493">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="37.923" offset="257087">Can I ask you about the deference that we should give to the briefs that have been filed in the First Circuit and the invitation brief in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="46.879" offset="292927">Auer deference seems pretty four-square with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.349" offset="310794">It's a brief that was filed to interpret an agency regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.385" offset="326990">But I'm wondering whether Auer continues to remain good law after Christensen and Mead.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.406" offset="359069">In Christensen the Court held, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="66.692" offset="372234">"Interpretations such as those in opinion letters, like interpretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which lack the force of law, do not warrant Chevron-style deference. "</text>
            <text syncTime="80.885" offset="428972">And Mead said pretty much the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.987" offset="437332">So it seems to me that there are three possibilities for why Auer remains good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.289" offset="458543">One is that briefs are somehow different from all those other things that we talked about in Christensen.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.843" offset="480799">Another is that an agency gets more deference when interpreting regulations than when interpreting its own statutes -- something that I think I just don't quite understand, but maybe you could convince me of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.769" offset="532522">And a third is, well, look, they are just basically inconsistent, but Auer was Auer and we don't feel like overruling cases, and we're not so sure we got it right in Christensen and Mead anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.243" offset="582363">So which is it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="120.493" stopTime="147.494">
            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="120.493" offset="587379">A lot of the above.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.545" offset="599604">First of all, Auer has been applied in the context of amicus briefs since Christensen and Mead, both -- unanimously both in Kennedy and in Long Island Care at Home.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.205" offset="658223">And I must say, in both of those cases the deference was to a brief that acknowledged a change in the agency's position, which is quite unlike what's going on here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="147.494" stopTime="157.218">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="147.494" offset="695421">Absolutely right, Mr. Waxman, but in each of those cases it was basically a sentence or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.798" offset="712662">We never really addressed the possible conflict between Auer and Christensen and Mead.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="157.218" stopTime="279.581">
            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="157.218" offset="734292">Nonetheless, I think those cases stand for the proposition that Auer is alive and well.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.022" offset="757488">And in any event, as your question pointed out, both Mead and Christensen and the passage in Christensen that you are referring to dealt with the question of Chevron deference to informal letters from the -- from, you know, a -- somebody who was employed by an administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.318" offset="830736">And the question in the case, the interpretive question in the case, in the Chevron context, is: What confidence can we have that Congress has in fact delegated to the agency interpretive or rulemaking authority in this context?</text>
            <text syncTime="198.862" offset="900848">And so, for example, in Mead, the Court distinguished between notice and comment regulations that Customs put out, as opposed to the kind of determinations that were made by 46 different offices at the rate of something like 15,000 letters a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.372" offset="962915">In the -- when Christensen dealt with the Auer question, because it did involve a -- an informal opinion of the wage and hour administrator both interpreting the Fair Labor Standards Act and the regulation, when it came to interpreting the regulation what this Court said is: Our deference doesn't apply here because we read the regulation as clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.320" offset="1058732">And Auer, of course, made clear that deference is due to an agency brief unless it is plainly erroneous or the regulation is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.962" offset="1105230">Now, here we have a situation in which it is not an agency staff or whatever that has applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.068" offset="1137727">The First Circuit asked the government for -- solicited the Federal Reserve Board itself to explain the meaning of its own regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.975" offset="1185270">And the brief that was filed represented that it was the longstanding and consistent interpretation of the Federal Reserve Board that--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="279.581" offset="1223722">Mr. Waxman, I take it from this whole discussion that you are recognizing that this is not a crystal-clear regulation; there is some ambiguity, and that's why we are talking about how much deference we owe to the agency?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="295.341" stopTime="334.466">
            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="295.341" offset="1286834">--That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.057" offset="1289655">We think that the Federal Reserve Board's reading of the two regulatory provisions is the better reading, but we acknowledge, as every court I think that has addressed this, that there is some ambiguity just looking at the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.683" offset="1344199">But I think it's important to understand also that the views expressed in the amicus brief solicited by the First Circuit and by this Court are entirely consistent with explanations that the Board, as a Board, provided in the course of a 4-year rulemaking process about what these provisions mean.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="334.466" stopTime="345.707">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="334.466" offset="1443255">So you think the same deference is owed to ANPR's as to the amicus briefs?</text>
            <text syncTime="342.255" offset="1474393">What is your position on that?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="345.707" offset="1488290">I -- I think that if it weren't for the amicus briefs in this case which are later in time and address the very specific question that is presented in this case, our deference would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.616" offset="1543879">And it's not just an ANPR.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.485" offset="1551402">There was the Federal Reserve explanation accompanying the ANPR, a functionally identical explanation accompanying the proposed rule, and one also accompanying the final rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.726" offset="1608349">And those explanations of the Board are entitled to Auer deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.197" offset="1630187">After all, in Anderson Ford, another case involving the construction of Regulation Z, this Court acknowledged that deference was due to a proposed -- the commentary accompanying a proposed change in Regulation Z which had not in fact even been implemented.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.681" offset="1840107">Now, of course Judge Cudahy was deciding this before the First Circuit had solicited the views.</text>

            <text syncTime="1939.206" offset="7862272">Section 226.9(c)(2) says that no notice is required when any component of the finance charge decreases or is changed in the customer's favor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1966.206" offset="7970210">And we disagree with that as well, first of all because, as I was saying to Justice Ginsburg, you need to have the notice that there has been a change at all in order to -- to realize that you might want to avoid making extra purchases or consider -- not throw away the low APR offer that comes in the mail, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.519" offset="8047532">And also, aside from that, we think that when you have only a -- a maximum rate, that is basically the equivalent of a range of possible rates between the initial rate and the maximum rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.577" offset="8095702">And that undercuts the ability to compare loans at the time of the cardholder agreement, even before the whole default comes into play, because at that point you have to compare two loans with two possible ranges of rates, and the key factor between the two, the value of the two loans, is how the credit card company will issue -- will use its discretion--</text>

            <text syncTime="2391.200" offset="9670259">--Well, I would say that even the government doesn't -- doesn't agree with that, that "may" means that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.437" offset="9695128">Because that would -- the government doesn't argue initial disclosures don't have to be specific and don't have to be -- don't have to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.591" offset="9719787">The government's argument is a little bit different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.443" offset="9727206">What they are saying is that the word 226.9 means contractual terms rather than credit terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.299" offset="9762628">And that's a different argument because it doesn't -- it wouldn't -- it wouldn't affect the initial disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.001" offset="9785407">It would only -- it would only mean that you don't have to give subsequent notice if you haven't changed the contract in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.439" offset="9811216">And so these are actually somewhat -- somewhat different theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.141" offset="9825949">And under the government's theory, there would be no role for section 226.9 to play because you would -- the only times it would come into play is when there is a change in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.080" offset="9865759">And any time there is a change in the contract, under the basic contract law of every State, you have to provide notice at least to the other party to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.055" offset="9905674">So the only time notice would be required under section 226.9 would be when the -- when contract law requires that notice to be given anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.042" offset="9937544">And even worse than that, it would -- it would actually cut back on the required notice that would be available under contract law, because, for example, Delaware says you have to give 15 days advance notice of a change in terms to a credit card agreement in the event of a default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.687" offset="10008179">And under this reading, you would -- even if the creditor changed the terms of the contract, as in increased the default rate above the maximum that the contract would authorize -- so the contract says we can charge you 30 percent in the event of a default and you impose an interest rate of 100 percent -- then even in those circumstances, you only have to provide contemporaneous notice of the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.286" offset="10098563">So you would basically have to put a letter in the mailbox on the day that you implement the new 100 percent interest rate that was not disclosed in the initial agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.392" offset="10130954">And our submission is that that is not a reasonable interpretation of section 226.9.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.343" offset="10150808">And it is true that the rules have been amended, but we have to look at the purpose of the rules from the point of view of the -- of the board which enacted those rules in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.584" offset="10191768">And you can't assume that the Board at that time expected a set of rules that would never -- that would never require subsequent notice to be -- to be supplied unless there is a change in the terms of a contract, in which -- in which notice would have to be required anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.844" offset="10256760">The next point that the parties -- aside from the language of the -- of the regulation itself, the parties rely on official staff commentary, as do we, in supporting their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.039" offset="10317573">And the parties argue that the word "specific" allows them to -- I'm sorry -- the government and Chase Bank argue that the word "specific" allows them to specify in advance only the maximum rate and that the word "specific" encompasses a maximum, and the circumstances of causing that maximum to go in effect of a universal default situation, where if you default to any creditor or make a late payment to any creditor, then it triggers the new rate, which goes up to a discretionary maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.295" offset="10462605">It's our contention that that kind of situation of a universal default and a discretionary maximum rate is not a specific disclosure under any sense of the word.</text>

            <text syncTime="2996.352" offset="12090870">And that's very different from a case where you are not sure, first of all, whether the bank is going to use its discretion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.023" offset="12113544">You don't know for sure if whether there is anything negative on your credit report that would even trigger that discretion to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.492" offset="12139353">And you don't know if the discretion is triggered what the rate will be because the bank reserves discretion to set it anywhere up to the maximum.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gregory A. Beck</label>
            <text syncTime="3023.452" offset="12199225">There is the discretionary difference, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.406" offset="12215003">In the bank situation the rate is automatic and it does not base, it doesn't just trigger an exercise of discretion.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="3034.644" offset="12243947">Well, I don't see that in the example that's given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.529" offset="12255545">I don't see that it limits it to a situation in which there is an automatic increase in your rate rather than a discretionary increase in your rate.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gregory_beck" startTime="3046.535" stopTime="3180.503">
            <label>Mr. Gregory A. Beck</label>
            <text syncTime="3046.535" offset="12291594">For that I would look to section 226.6(a)(2), which says that each periodic rate and the range of balances to which it is applicable must be set forth initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.342" offset="12338824">And so you know from the very beginning which balances on your account would trigger a certain interest rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.013" offset="12365469">So there is no, in that case there is no uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.281" offset="12374559">But the other difference is that in a bank account situation, you're balance either above the maximum or below the maximum, but when you are talking about universal default, it is not always going to be obvious to you, first of all, whether anyone has reported anything to the credit agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.125" offset="12433910">Oftentimes certain creditors will overlook a certain late payment, for example, and maybe they reported one and it might not show up on your Experian credit report for months or years later and then you will not know at what point it comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.300" offset="12490648">So the only way to know for sure in that circumstance is to subscribe to the Experian credit reporting service just like Chase does so that you would know when there are any negative events that are reported to the credit agency that would possibly trigger Chase's discretion, but even in that case you would not know for sure whether Chase had implemented its discretion or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.512" offset="12567448">And I wanted to say the Government, its own interpretation of the regulation is, especially when considering the amendment is itself inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.118" offset="12613841">Because the Government says that the new regulation fixed the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.486" offset="12627320">But the new regulation uses the same language as the old regulation when it comes to what's required for a later change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.926" offset="12661175">It does carve out the default rate situation is a special case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.561" offset="12679670">But for every other kind of rate increase that has happened subsequent to the initial disclosure, it still uses as a triggering event any change in terms required to be disclosed by section 226.6.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.935" offset="12725123">And if it were true that what the Board wanted to do was fix this ambiguity and this problem that was set forth, that was in the original regulations, then it would be very, very unlikely that the Government would then implement the same language in the amended regulation to meet that same ambiguity in place rather than clarifying exactly when subsequent notice would be required.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="3180.503" offset="12827418">I'm not following that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.486" offset="12835359">I thought that the new regulation says now any time there is a change in the rate, whether it was announced originally or comes up later, just keeping it nice and simple, a rate change, you send notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.964" offset="12901292">And that's -- and you have to do it -- give 45 days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.868" offset="12924907">I thought that is what the new regulation was?</text>

            <text syncTime="3207.903" offset="12937028">That's why I am saying the Government is inconsistent because that's what the Government says that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.605" offset="12955836">But what the regulation actually says in 226.6(c), the new version, any change required to be disclosed -- a change in any term required to be disclosed within section 226.6 is the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.532" offset="13011529">It is true that there is a new subsection g that applies just to default rates, and it is very extensive because it covers a lot of aspects of default rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.137" offset="13041936">So now I think it is clear that default rate increases would have to be disclosed, so the problem in this case would certainly be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.974" offset="13069312">But the Government's position is that there was a consolidation of all change notices into one 45 day notice period, and that's not clear from the regulation because it still uses this same ambiguous language that was in the old version.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.151" offset="13130021">So I think the Court -- the Court should -- and for us that's an independent reason for the Court to view skeptically the Government's submissions in this case and view it with some skepticism instead of granting it the force of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.525" offset="13179549">The Court should consider that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.643" offset="13188012">The Board itself hasn't adopted a consistent interpretation of the language at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3290.607" offset="13267843">My interest was peaked when Justice Breyer said that he acknowledged that he may have no idea what he was talking about with respect to a reservation of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.580" offset="13307758">And I just want to be clear that reservation of rights clauses, which are also referred to as change in terms clauses, are ubiquitous in these contracts and initial disclosures, they are a term of art as the Board has recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.457" offset="13371288">And what they are is simply a statement by the credit card issuer in a consumer open credit account arrangement that, you know, it may decide to change any term in any respect at any time and the Board's regulations make clear that if you do that, that is if you implement a change in terms pursuant to a reservation of rights clause, you have to provide notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3395.540" offset="13687578">"If the initial rate may increase upon the occurrence of one or more specific events such as a late payment or an extension of credit that exceeds the credit limit, the creditor must disclose the initial rate and the increased penalty rate that may apply. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.840" offset="13780783">And this was an amendment in 1998 that the Board made to Reg Z in what it recognized, what it stated was on account of the increased use of default penalty terms in the initial disclosures, that it wanted to make clear that if both the triggering event and the maximum rate was specified there would be no change in terms if an increased rate were implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.711" offset="13904290">And finally, I just want to address my friend's point that there may be some question about whether TILA even authorizes the Board's explanation of the type of subsequent disclosure that was or wasn't required and underscore Mr. Palmore's observation that in TILA until 2009 there was a requirement for initial disclosures, there was a requirement for periodic statements, but nothing at all about subsequent disclosures.</text>
