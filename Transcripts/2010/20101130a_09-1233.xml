            <text syncTime="10.846" offset="148835">What this Court has under review today is an extraordinary and unprecedented order issued by a three-judge District Court, requiring the release of between 36,000 and 45,000 inmates, currently incarcerated in the California penal system within a two-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.721" offset="232323">The order in this particular case is made particularly remarkable because it strikes me that at a minimum it is extraordinarily premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.496" offset="271402">That it may come at some point in this process that an order, probably substantially smaller in scope than this one, may become appropriate, but if this is supposed to be an order or remedy of last resort, and what the district court has done here is leapfrogged a series of steps that should have been taken ahead of going this particular route.</text>

            <text syncTime="87.706" offset="456244">I think, obviously, the length of time you have to wait in some ways depends on what the state of the remedial phase is in the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.410" offset="487069">And in this case and in recognition, frankly, of the substantial problems that were inherent in the penal system as it existed during the 1990s and up until the early 2000s, a receiver was appointed, specifically in the Plata class, but there was also a connection between the receiver and the special master even in the Coleman class before the three-judge panel was convened.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.921" offset="589155">And under those circumstances and given the extraordinary powers that the receiver had been accorded, what should have -- the most logical course if this is supposed to be a remedy of last resort was to allow the receiver an opportunity to implement the extraordinary powers that were conferred upon him, and then see, because if it turns out that we are making progress –</text>

            <text syncTime="151.432" offset="711199">The court below talked about some proposals like construction and said the legislature has struck them down.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.667" offset="748084">There's -- the fiscal crisis has gotten worse, so construction is really not an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.527" offset="771490">I don't see how you wait for an option that doesn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.217" offset="790298">They talked about hiring more staff, but the conclusion was that even if you maximize the staff, you don't have the facilities to add more staff, which is what you need to cure the constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.094" offset="849753">So tell me what specific steps outside of this order should have been given time to be implemented because the receiver has basically said, “I've tried, and the small progress we made has been reversed because the population just keeps growing.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.518" offset="931464">So we can never get ahead of the problem.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1276.683" offset="5212202">So I think that is still a difficult and open question as to how to proceed, but it still strikes me that the sequence that Congress envisions and the one that would make the most sense and ultimately the one that hopefully would accommodate both the plaintiffs' interests and the State's interests, and the Department of Corrections' interests, is to allow the receiver to stay on a course that candidly I think will in fact get you there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.153" offset="5310004">I mean, again, one of the real flaws in this case, Justice Kennedy, is nobody doubts for a moment that there have been very significant violations of constitutional rights years gone by, and indeed a failure on the mental health side ultimately to get you -- get to the point where we are in fact providing a significant remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.760" offset="7072434">You know, you have these judges who have been involved in these cases since the beginning, for 20 years in the Plata case, who thought, we've done everything we can.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.349" offset="7182775">So how can we reach a result essentially without, you know, re-finding the facts that they have been dealing with for 20 years?</text>

            <text syncTime="1782.349" offset="7234811">First of all, remember that the receiver gets appointed and then three months later you get a motion for a three-judge court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1797.377" offset="7294892">So the reality is that is the fundamental legal error I'm asking this Court to correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.082" offset="7313701">But even if you get beyond that and you are looking at the primary cause analysis, it seems to me that's -- that's at most, at best, a mixed question of law and fact, and it's the kind of standard that this Court ought to analyze to determine in the first instance and on an independent review whether or not the overcrowding is "the primary cause of the violation."</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.514" offset="7391441">And what makes that inquiry particularly appropriate for this Court, as opposed to simply slavishly adhering and deferring to the district court in this circumstance, is that the district court arbitrarily cut off the record in August of 2008 and there have been enormous developments since then and there were enormous developments --</text>

            <text syncTime="2033.047" offset="8237599">But even that it seems to me would be a mistake under these circumstances where the special master and receiver have been in a sense joined at the hip in a variety of ways, it only makes sense, because the receiver is controlling the provision of medical care in the CDCR and the special master is taking care of or trying to promote a very small slice of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="4507.023" offset="18133514">I believe in this case, the court gave the State the maximum degree of flexibility to make all the policy choices surrounding -- surrounding the incarceration of these prisoners.</text>

            <text syncTime="4797.487" offset="19295336">I think so, but I'm still concerned because the district court in this specific says, we have not evaluated the -- the safety impact of each of the State's -- of the elements the elements of the State's proposed plan, and it seems to me they had an obligation to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4812.206" offset="19354269">The other point I want to make with respect to Justice Kennedy's question is that there is not a shred of evidence that 137.5 makes any sense whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4819.531" offset="19383526">That is a pulled out of the air number.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.597" offset="19391781">Theirs was aspirational.</text>
            <text syncTime="4823.622" offset="19399931">None of that is based on what is the constitutional violation that exists at the time you adopt that particular percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.230" offset="19434308">And it seems to me this is the entire problem with this -- this exercise, which is to say we are going to fix this across the board, rather than what would make much more sense, which is to evaluate these matters facility by facility, to evaluate these matters on the basis of various discrete elements of how you can reduce the prison population, and to do it in -- in conjunction with a receiver who is in place who can help to implement this in a very systematic way and that will get us to where we want to get to.</text>

            <text syncTime="4860.599" offset="19547784">So why didn't you give the court that as your plan?</text>
            <text syncTime="4863.678" offset="19560114">The court gave you absolute discretion to implement the plan that you wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.167" offset="19582056">It said we don't want to do facility by facility, because we want you to figure out where you need to implement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4877.388" offset="19614971">So, your client didn't do that, why, either in your 5-year plan or in your 2-year plan?</text>

            <text syncTime="4883.252">Because the district court's order said you are going to have to reach 137.5 percent in two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.215">That's the categorical rule, and the first time we went in to suggest something above 137 and a half, Judge Henderson said, "I'm not hearing that".</text>
