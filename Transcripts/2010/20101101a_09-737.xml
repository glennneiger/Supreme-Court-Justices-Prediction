            <text syncTime="7.760" offset="137529">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.804" offset="153621">Denial of summary judgment is not reviewable on appeal after trial, especially where the decision depends on whether the evidence on the merits of the claim is sufficient to cross the legal line for liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.940" offset="226241">In this case--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="31.952" offset="234287">I'm sorry to interrupt so quickly, but that especially I take it -- I take it as a concession that there's a difference between claims for qualified immunity based on evidence and claims that are based on law.</text>

            <label>Mr. David E. Mills</label>
            <text syncTime="43.729" offset="281412">--Well, there's a difference between defenses that depend on the evidence at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.709" offset="301265">What I would say about qualified immunity is that to the extent any court of appeals is going to enter judgment based on qualified immunity, it needs to understand the conduct of the officials in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.860" offset="349853">And so you're always talking about the evidence of that conduct.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="65.765" offset="369497">Well, of course there is always -- there are always facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.607" offset="380886">There are often disputed facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.013" offset="390499">But suppose the issue is whether or not this right -- and maybe there are two rights here -- this right was clearly established.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.086" offset="422787">That is an issue of law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_e_mills" startTime="80.446" stopTime="82.884">
            <label>Mr. David E. Mills</label>
            <text syncTime="80.446" offset="428220">That is -- that is an issue of law, Your Honor.</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="82.884" stopTime="120.118">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="82.884" offset="437938">And doesn't that fall within the "except" clause that the Chief Justice was talking to you about, which you haven't had much time to fill out, I understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.849" offset="473882">But -- well, if you're going to say -- and it's really not whether the summary judgment is appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.736" offset="501363">That's a little bit -- it's whether or not the issues resolved by the summary judgment motion are appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.762" offset="533441">As I read into your response or implied from your response to what the Chief Justice said, maybe sometimes the summary judgment motion, say on an issue of law, is sufficient to preserve the issue.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_e_mills" startTime="120.118" stopTime="187.104">
            <label>Mr. David E. Mills</label>
            <text syncTime="120.118" offset="586940">Well, and that gets to what I think is the heart of the split in the circuits and the confusion, is that every circuit recognizes a very general rule that where the evidence at trial moots that at summary judgment we are not going to review the summary judgment decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.656" offset="653082">Now, a number of courts said: Well, wait a second; there are summary judgment issues that don't depend on the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.934" offset="678160">Those are typically called questions of law, and Respondents point to a number of good examples in their brief of defenses such as statute of limitations, preemption, and the like, that indeed very often don't depend at all on the evidence at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.384" offset="731972">The difference with qualified immunity is that qualified immunity requires the court to look at the evidence of the claim itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.345" offset="775858">Now, statute of limitations, for example, is actually quite different, because in statute of limitations -- let's suppose Michelle Ortiz filed her suit 20 years late.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.093" offset="818803">It would not matter at all how much evidence she adduced of the Respondents' misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.511" offset="844507">It would be barred by statute of limitations.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="187.104" stopTime="236.242">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="187.104" offset="854852">So Mr. Mills, what then is the difference?</text>
            <text syncTime="189.868" offset="865928">You point out, quite rightly, summary judgment looks to what evidence there was and the question for the Court is: What could the plaintiff prove?</text>
            <text syncTime="203.303" offset="919636">When we get past trial, the issue becomes: What has the plaintiff proved?</text>
            <text syncTime="212.470" offset="956312">So what was brought out at trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="216.951" offset="974284">What was the record at trial that was larger than the record at summary judgment?</text>
            <text syncTime="224.527" offset="1004586">Because if there was no -- no new fact presentation, no more ample fact presentation, then it wouldn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.836" offset="1041784">It would be the same body of evidence, right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_e_mills" startTime="236.242" stopTime="288.561">
            <label>Mr. David E. Mills</label>
            <text syncTime="236.242" offset="1051397">Well, I think that's largely -- largely right, Justice Ginsburg, and here's an example of what did change in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.862" offset="1081908">At the summary judgment stage, what we had were affidavits of the Respondents discussing their role in relation to this case, with no comment whatsoever about what the consequences would have been had Ms. Jordan immediately reported the first sexual assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.823" offset="1153693">The record was bare at summary judgment from Respondents' perspective on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.899" offset="1174068">At trial, under cross-examination Ms. Bright testified that Respondent Jordan indeed violated prison policy by not reporting it and then, very crucially, also agreed that the second, more violent assault would have actually been precluded had that report taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.031" offset="1258600">Now, that's--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="288.561" stopTime="344.524">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="288.561" offset="1260690">This gets to what troubles me about this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.532" offset="1272602">Although the Sixth Circuit referred to summary judgment in its opinion, it seems to me the Sixth Circuit actually reviewed the evidence at trial and determined that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the evidence at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.554" offset="1348671">So I don't know why this case actually presents the question on which cert was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.317" offset="1375734">It seems to me it presents a question of -- a purely factual question in the end, whether there was -- whether judgment as a matter of law was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.816" offset="1413663">And you never raised the judgment as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.876" offset="1425993">You never raised in the court of appeals, as I understand it, the argument that the defendants' ability to object to the entry of judgment as a matter of law was waived because they never filed the Rule 50(b) motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.572" offset="1480746">Isn't that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_e_mills" startTime="344.524" stopTime="377.089">
            <label>Mr. David E. Mills</label>
            <text syncTime="344.524" offset="1484507">--Well, there's a couple points in there that I need to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.352" offset="1499867">First, I think that you are exactly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.211" offset="1511257">What the Sixth Circuit did here is it reviewed a summary judgment decision, but it did peek ahead to the trial evidence, and it said it was doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.550" offset="1548664">I think that highlights the fundamental problem of reviewing summary judgment after the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.532" offset="1572592">The Sixth Circuit is implicitly recognizing it would be illogical to look at that summary judgment record, those affidavits, and then ignore this cross-examined testimony--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="377.089" stopTime="424.646">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="377.089" offset="1614806">Well, suppose we were to hold that they couldn't review the denial of summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.211" offset="1635286">The case is remanded to them and they say: Okay, well, we made a slip of the pen when we referred to summary judgment in the prior decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.722" offset="1665379">We really were saying that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law and, although there wasn't a Rule 50(b) motion, that was waived because it wasn't raised on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.081" offset="1702787">So we are -- we come back to exactly where we are now.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.860" offset="1717833">All we have done is to correct a slip of the -- what was arguably a slip of the pen, perhaps motivated by their belief that the Rule 50(b) issue is jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.243" offset="1771436">But it really is not under our cases distinguishing between jurisdictional questions and claims processing questions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_e_mills" startTime="424.646" stopTime="471.363">
            <label>Mr. David E. Mills</label>
            <text syncTime="424.646" offset="1804978">--And I agree with that last point.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.036" offset="1814591">But here's the problem and here's why it isn't just simply a slip of the pen that can be fixed by remanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.017" offset="1842489">Even if this was not summary judgment whatsoever and it was, as Respondents say, essentially a Rule 50(a) review, that conflicts with an entire line of this Court's decisions leading into Unitherm which makes clear that the court of appeals absolutely lacks the power to review the sufficiency of the evidence where that question wasn't ruled upon by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.022" offset="1954503">And so the court of appeals here, regardless of any sort of forfeiture argument, absolutely lacked the power to consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.300" offset="1983655">The additional point about your--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="471.363" stopTime="479.173">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="471.363" offset="1991910">But that's not the point that you have made here, I mean, and that is not the point on which we granted certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.173" offset="2023152">--That's right and I think -- I think what I just said about the 50(b) point is that I think it highlights that this really was a summary judgment review by the Sixth Circuit.</text>

          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="488.996" stopTime="506.068">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="488.996" offset="2062440">Mr. Mills, if I could just understand your answer to Justice Alito.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.980" offset="2082398">You concede that the Sixth Circuit opinion is using the record built on the whole trial and that that's a different record from the record that existed at summary judgment; is that correct?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_e_mills" startTime="506.068" stopTime="513.687">
            <label>Mr. David E. Mills</label>
            <text syncTime="506.068" offset="2130672">I do concede it, except to the extent that I concede they did an adequate review of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.799" offset="2149689">But I concede that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.486" offset="2156377">For example--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="513.687" stopTime="533.851">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="513.687" offset="2161183">So they have that first paragraph where they suggest that they're ruling on a summary judgment motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.499" offset="2180409">Then they go through an entire opinion that talks about the facts and the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.450" offset="2196292">And there are very few citations, but your understanding is that when they talk about the facts in the record they are talking about the post-trial, I mean the record that has been built up as a result of the trial?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_e_mills" startTime="533.851" stopTime="595.823">
            <label>Mr. David E. Mills</label>
            <text syncTime="533.851" offset="2241849">--There are certainly a number of instances where they definitely are talking about the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.630" offset="2257000">I do think it is even muddy the extent to which they are incorporating trial facts with summary judgment facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.955" offset="2282287">The example I gave about this point where Mrs. Bright conceded on cross that Ms. Ortiz indeed would have been separated and the assault, second assault, precluded, it's one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.748" offset="2337458">Either the Sixth Circuit's reviewing summary judgment and picking a couple of trial facts it thinks helps to review and missing the facts; or it's doing -- it's looking ahead at these trial facts and because -- particularly because the district court never weighed in on that, on a Rule 50(b), it's botching the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.536" offset="2420632">And it goes to the heart of this Court's cases from Cone v. West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper in 1947 up through Unitherm, which says we have to have the district court review the sufficiency of the evidence before the court of appeals could even have the power to possibly consider this.</text>

            <text syncTime="604.632" offset="2525017">You are in essence claiming it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.928" offset="2534107">You are saying they lacked the power, but Justice Alito's question to you said they don't, that they've misread the fact that this is not a jurisdictional motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.748" offset="2617386">But I am making a distinction among jurisdiction and power, and it's the same distinction actually the Tenth Circuit employed in a case called Williams v. Gonterman, which is cited in our reply brief, I think it's at page 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.697" offset="2681229">But the exact issue came up, where the verdict loser said: Wait a second; this issue's been forfeited.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.131" offset="2706934">The Tenth Circuit, reading Unitherm, reading the debate between the majority and the dissenters, who said plain error and those doctrines should apply, said: We lack the power to review this; we have jurisdiction, but we lack the power.</text>

            <text syncTime="730.036" offset="3026568">That's the whole reason why there is this 50(a)-50(b) litany, why the verdict loser must repeat the 50(a) motion, after the verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="917.672" offset="3777118">As this Court's explained repeatedly, a requisite of a court of appeals reviewing that evidence that went to the jury is that the district court first, who has the feel of the case, who saw the witnesses, who saw Respondent Bright on cross-examination, first have the opportunity in the judge's discretion to grant a new trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.963" offset="13842307">Now, I think what that shows is the Sixth Circuit was definitely reviewing summary judgment but it, implicitly at least, recognized that would be entirely illogical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.988" offset="13886401">So it tied its decision to the only decision by the district court on qualified immunity, summary judgment, and said: We've got to look at what really happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.859" offset="13921928">And so they looked ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.764" offset="13925480">Now, the reason the question is adequately presented is because I think the Sixth Circuit's decision shows this entire debate about Unitherm and whether this was a quasi-50(a) review is one of the precise reasons the Sixth Circuit hinged its decision on summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.837" offset="13997787">I think it was quite aware that an appellate court, since at least 1947, in Cone, cannot review the sufficiency of the evidence at trial and overturn the jury's verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.253" offset="14047420">And so the Sixth Circuit said: Wait a second; we can look to the summary judgment record.</text>

            <text syncTime="3521.426" offset="14192138">You say if you want counsel judgment, simply make your motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.456" offset="14204259">But I would add that whichever way this court goes, the decision here has to be reversed, because there is no doubt that the legal issue of qualified immunity at summary judgment depended entirely on the officer's conduct at trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3565.830" offset="14369771">It's easily preserved, but to the extent a trial occurs on the officer's conduct and the officers want to say: Wait a second, we're still immune, that evidence even at trial is insufficient for liability.</text>
