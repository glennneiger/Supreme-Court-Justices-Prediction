            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">This is a ERISA pension case which means it's pretty complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.648" offset="128042">But in the case, petitioner was a company called CIGNA runs a pension plan for its employees and the plan is governed by ERISA, the Employment Retirement Security Act of 18 -- 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.099" offset="181854">Now under ERISA, participants in a pension plan are entitled to get periodic summaries of their benefits and obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.503" offset="219470">In 1997, CIGNA decided to change its pension plan and it sent notices to the plan participants but the notices omitted certain key details about reductions of the rate that employees would accrue benefits in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.670" offset="276104">And in particular, it -- they -- CIGNA did not tell its employees that -- because of a mathematical core of a certain kind, the way in which the -- they were going to calculate those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.984" offset="317377">Those employees could work many years without accruing any additional benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.902" offset="337021">After the bench trial, the District Court found that CIGNA's disclosures violated ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.474" offset="359278">So, there's a violation, but what's the remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="67.475" offset="375369">CIGNA claimed that there is no remedy unless the participants proved that they relied upon the misstatements to their detriment.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.303" offset="410582">The District Court found there could be a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.039" offset="421554">If the false disclosures resulted in likely harm to the plan participants and it said, "Well, the participants here can get -- recover the benefits because -- under a remedy provision, 502(a)(1)(B)", which I'm going to call remedy prong one.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.387" offset="498981">That prong one permits the participant, “to recover benefits due to him under the terms of the plan.”</text>
            <text syncTime="106.470" offset="531268">So, the Second Circuit affirmed to get the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.215" offset="546314">But we granted cert to determine what standard of harm the participants have to satisfy.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.999" offset="569407">Is it as the District Court thought likely harm?</text>
            <text syncTime="119.423" offset="583095">Or is it as CIGNA said reliance to ones detriment?</text>
            <text syncTime="123.949" offset="601172">But we first found that we have to consider whether the District Court should have treated the summary benefit descriptions under remedy prong one.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.168" offset="638056">Was this whole thing benefits due under the terms of the plan?</text>
            <text syncTime="137.514" offset="655506">Well, so now what do we hold?</text>
            <text syncTime="139.334" offset="662716">Well, in a sense we hold that that prong one, benefits due under the plan in this case is the wrong prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.077" offset="689779">The District Court's remedy consisted of two steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.314" offset="702631">The first step was to reform the terms of the plan to comport with the summary documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.404" offset="723007">The second was to make CIGNA enforce the plan as it was rewritten.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.434" offset="743173">Now that second step is certainly part of enforcing the plan benefits but we don't see how changing the plan can be part of -- in giving them the benefits due under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.912" offset="785074">So where does the District Court get the authority to do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="173.720" offset="800329">Well, the failure of the District Court to bring us remedy within prong one does not mean that the participants are necessarily out of luck.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.673" offset="836065">That's because there's another remedial provision, 502(a)(3) called prong two and that permits the participants to obtain, “other appropriate equitable relief to redress ERISA violations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="198.281" offset="898550">The District Court thought that that relief was unavailable but we disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.014" offset="917462">Under one of our earlier cases called Mertens, the phrase appropriate equitable relief refers to those categories of relief that before the merger of law and equity were typically available in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.585" offset="967722">And so we looked it up and we found that there are at least three remedies here from equity, consistent with what the District Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.923" offset="1005129">It might satisfy the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.180" offset="1014115">Courts in equity use to reform an instrument to reflect the parties' mutual intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.227" offset="1038357">They used to be able to stop a party from benefiting from its factor misrepresentations.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.629" offset="1059986">And they used to be able to surcharge awarding money damages against the trustee for a breach of his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.515" offset="1087467">We'll leave it to the District Court to determine which if any of these remedies is appropriate in light of the facts of this case and that leaves us with the question we initially agreed to decide, whether showing of likely harm is sufficient under ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.257" offset="1146399">For purposes of this prong two, we conclude that the standard of prejudice that applies must be the standard -- the same standard that would've applied to the particular (Inaudible) -- equitable remedy that's imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.560" offset="1195614">For example, detrimental reliance would've been and it would be required for relief based on the equitable remedy of the estoppel as it used to be in the Court of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.485" offset="1235320">But, its only a showing of actual harm would've been necessary for relief based on the equitable remedy of surcharge for these reasons and those given at even greater length.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.007" offset="1289446">In our opinion filed today, we vacate the judgment of the Second Circuit and we remand for further proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.942" offset="1317240">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Thomas joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.618" offset="1339914">Justice Sotomayor took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
