            <text syncTime="11.572" offset="151656">William Freeman's plea agreement, his presentence report, and the sentencing record all show that his term of imprisonment was based on a crack cocaine guideline that was retroactively lowered by the United States Sentencing Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.615" offset="207872">This case asked the Court to decide whether the fact that a sentencing court accepted a plea agreement under Criminal Rule 11(c)(1)(C) precludes eligibility for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="40.708" offset="268267">We submit that Mr. Freeman is not barred from eligibility for a (c)(2) sentence reduction for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.397" offset="295016">First, under the ordinary definition of Mr. Freeman's term of imprisonment, that term of imprisonment was based on the subsequently lowered guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.942" offset="369204">Second, the categorical ban on eligibility adopted by the Sixth Circuit and advanced by the Government frustrates the purpose underlying section (c)(2) and finds no support in the plain language of the statute, of the rule, and under the terms of Mr. Freeman's plea agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.487" offset="447363">Third, a record-based analysis that reviews the plea agreement, the presentence report, and the sentencing record to determine the basis of the sentence is -- is best suited to correctly implement section (c)(2), and it's -- that record-based analysis supports the conclusion that Mr. Freeman's sentence was indeed based on a retroactively lowered guideline.</text>

            <text syncTime="2334.198" offset="9442262">So it seems to lead logically to the conclusion that 3582 is yet another provision of the Sentencing Reform Act that was tied to the old pre-Booker mandatory sentencing regime, and now that that is out the window with Booker and Fanfan, the whole -- the whole mechanism is -- is superfluous.</text>

            <text syncTime="3302.348" offset="13314863">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.431" offset="13319147">And that specifically contemplated in Rule 11(c) and in the guidelines, that the judge may postpone acceptance of the plea agreement until after the presentence report is prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.322" offset="13370661">And the judge did do that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.941" offset="13377139">So he was aware of what the PSR recommended, but once, and had he decided that he did not like the 106 month sentence and he wanted to preserve his sentencing discretion, the option at that point was to have rejected the plea agreement, at which point the parties would have been free to do different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.402" offset="13454984">And among other things, the Government could then have then argued for a higher sentence within the range.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.854" offset="13468881">Could have argued that the criminal history failed to represent the seriousness of the defendant's criminal past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.258" offset="13490406">Could have argued for an upward departure even, but the Defendant got the benefit of the 106 month agreement of not having the Government raise any of those other arguments at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.530" offset="13535545">And now he is asking for essentially another bite of the apple and we think that because the basis for the sentence was indeed the negotiation and the agreement between the parties, that the court of appeals decision was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.991" offset="13597403">If there are no further questions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank W. Heft, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3379.395" offset="13623003">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.930" offset="13641185">Just a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.465" offset="13647245">First of all, the record here leaves no doubt that the judge based his sentence on the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.786" offset="13672532">The sentencing transcript specifically states that the judge and I'd like to quote this, this is at page 47 of the joint appendix and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.557" offset="13715686">"the court will adopt the findings of the probation officer disclosed in the probation report and application of the guidelines as set out therein. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.663" offset="13748078">On page 48 of the joint appendix the judge says, having considered the advisory guidelines, he went on to impose that sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.984" offset="13777335">So it is quite clear that the judge and even in his statements of reasons on page 95 of the joint appendix, again reaffirmed that this sentence was based on the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.309" offset="13822683">Now, the other point that I'd like to make is that the Government acknowledges that it has carved out a very small exception to its argument that C pleas regarding specific sentences and sentencing ranges are not eligible for (c)(2) relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.753" offset="13892483">But it seems to me that reading, taking the Government position into account, if this plea agreement had not stated 106 months, then Mr. Freeman's under the terms of this plea agreement in the Government's view and under the Government's argument of what exception exists under the C pleas for purposes of 3582, Mr. Freeman would be eligible for the relief that was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.821" offset="13996659">And we would simply urge the Court in this case to adopt a rule that does not exclude specific sentences and C pleas for eligibility in 3582.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.663" offset="14060084">Thank you.</text>
