            <label>Mr. Pratik A. Shah</label>
            <text syncTime="8.437" offset="138094">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.558" offset="154603">Relying on common law trust principles applicable to private fiduciaries, the Federal Circuit imposed on the United States a duty to disclose attorney-client privileged communications to an Indian tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.865" offset="199847">That abrogation of the privilege should be reversed for at least three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.983" offset="216357">First, reflecting the sovereign nature of the United States function, the Indian trust context lacks the factors essential to recognition of a private trust fiduciary exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.089" offset="260765">Unlike in a private trust, government attorneys and other Federal officials owe an exclusive duty of loyalty to the United States, not to the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.445" offset="294201">The government pays the cost of trust administration out of appropriated funds, not out of the trust corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.699" offset="319175">The government, not the trust, owns the resulting record, and the release of such governmental record, including to a tribe or individual Indian, is governed by specific statutes and regulations as well as the Freedom of Information Act, not the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.624" offset="378943">Second, the decision below conflicts with this Court's precedents that distinguish the United States from a private trustee and that reject enforcement of duties governing the administration of Indian property that are not set forth by specific statute or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.618" offset="438920">The fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege is premised on a private trustee's general common law duty to disclose trust information, but no statute or regulation imposes such a duty on the United States.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="96.711" stopTime="172.811">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="96.711" offset="491269">Counsel, all of the statutes relating to these funds use the word "trust".</text>
            <text syncTime="105.066" offset="524706">Not one statute defines trust and says in any way this is not a fiduciary relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.172" offset="561068">To the contrary, in fact, most of the statutes require what would be consistent with fiduciary obligations, and at least one of them that you rely on says "but not limited to".</text>
            <text syncTime="126.980" offset="612268">So the issue before us doesn't involve a competing sovereign interest by the U.S. You've conceded that in your cert petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.621" offset="658871">The circuit below said this is not a case where there is an independent sovereign issue governing the U.S. activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.910" offset="696069">Just explain to me what's the rationale that would permit a trustee of a trust fund to withhold from the beneficiary the kinds of documents that relate to the management of the fund?</text>
            <text syncTime="164.705" offset="763256">If the funds exist for the benefit of the Indian tribe, why aren't they entitled to management documents?</text>

          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="173.978" stopTime="178.346">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="173.978" offset="800350">That's the part that doesn't make -- that you're not explaining.</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="178.346" stopTime="187.470">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="178.346" offset="817800">Mr. Shah, you might want to make your third point.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.882" offset="827935">You said you had three points preliminarily, so why don't you make your third point and then respond to the question.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="pratik_shah" startTime="187.470" stopTime="294.157">
            <label>Mr. Pratik A. Shah</label>
            <text syncTime="187.470" offset="854267">--Sure, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.270" offset="857506">The third point is that the Federal Circuit's decision poses serious practical problems for the government because the general common law duty to disclose which undergirds the fiduciary exception extends to all trust information without regard to the existence of litigation; excepting it implies a broad and burdensome disclosure obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.051" offset="936605">For example, there are over 300,000 individual account holders, individual Indian account holders on top of the tribal, tribal account holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.407" offset="974012">If this Court were to accept the fiduciary exception and thereby ratify the underlying rationale, presumably then any one of those or all of those 300-plus thousand individual account holders could simply call up the Interior Department and request all related trust records outside of the existing statutory and regulatory regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.653" offset="1054992">Now, Justice Sotomayor, let me turn back to your set of questions, and let me start with the first point that you made, which is the statutes here use the term trust; why doesn't that connote some sort of broad fiduciary relationship?</text>
            <text syncTime="254.913" offset="1124059">This Court has made clear in its precedents, and it dates back to the Mitchell 1, the first decision in Mitchell case, where Congress's use of the term "trust", the Court said, does not imply the full gamut of common law fiduciary obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.707" offset="1187276">The dissent made precisely -- the dissent in Mitchell made precisely the argument that you're sketching out here, which is when Congress uses a term like trust, we would naturally assume that it implies fiduciary obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.515" offset="1234505">The majority in Mitchell rejected that notion, and in fact in Mitchell 2 in the Navajo Nation decisions, the Court has continued to reject that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.788" offset="1267524">But more -- more than as a matter of precedent I think that makes--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="294.157" stopTime="310.099">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="294.157" offset="1281003">But in both -- in all of those cases, counsel, it was a limitation related to competing interests, meaning it was recognizing that there are potentially moments in which an attorney is acting both in the interest of the government and in the interest of the tribe.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="pratik_shah" startTime="310.099" stopTime="354.259">
            <label>Mr. Pratik A. Shah</label>
            <text syncTime="310.099" offset="1344742">--Justice Sotomayor, with respect, there is no competing interest that I'm aware of that were mentioned in -- in the Mitchell decisions, Mitchell 1, Mitchell 2, or even the Navajo Nation decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.038" offset="1384552">Those were simply -- in Mitchell 1 it was the Indian General Allotment Act, which said that the United States "shall hold in trust" land for the benefit of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.327" offset="1425721">The argument made by the tribe in that case and by the dissenters in the Court was when the Court said you shall hold the land in trust, that implies certain management and other responsibilities for resources related to that land.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.237" offset="1477339">This Court said no, when Congress uses the term "trust" in the Indian context, that there must be specific statutory regulatory duties that the Court sets out.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.276" offset="1517464">Let me explain--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="354.259" stopTime="379.744">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="354.259" offset="1521434">But that was a jurisdictional question, not a question with respect to -- to the -- to the obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.215" offset="1553304">You're not seriously suggesting that if you're a trustee of an Indian fund that you can breach your fiduciary duty by simply not exercising care in your investment strategies.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.590" offset="1602727">So some form of -- of duty exists.</text>

            <label>Mr. Pratik A. Shah</label>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>

          <turn speaker="pratik_shah" startTime="384.564" stopTime="409.513">

            <text syncTime="384.564" offset="1642642">--Well, Your Honor, I agree everything up to the point when you said we go to the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.700" offset="1663227">Of course there would be in this context some enforceable duties with respect to investment of the funds held in trust, and that's because the relevant statutes, section 161a and 162a, set forth specific investment duties that the government must comply with.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.077" offset="1728742">Now, as to your other point, that Mitchell 1 and the Navajo Nation--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="409.513" stopTime="428.677">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="409.513" offset="1742430">And so why would, if it imposes those duties, protect you from disclosing items that might -- attorney confidences that go to that very act, the very act of investing in the way, even under your definition, that the trust requires you to?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="pratik_shah" startTime="428.677" stopTime="514.247">
            <label>Mr. Pratik A. Shah</label>
            <text syncTime="428.677" offset="1819126">--A couple responses, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.177" offset="1825081">The -- the two statutes that you're talking about, 161a and 162a, set forth specific investment duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.997" offset="1852353">They don't say anything about disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.731" offset="1859354">The 1994 Act does set forth some disclosure obligations, but they are extremely discrete.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.835" offset="1883700">There are essentially two disclosure obligations that all of these statutes together impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.555" offset="1906584">The -- the United States must provide an account statement, a quarterly account statement; and the United States must provide the -- the Indian tribes and individual Indians an annual audit.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.862" offset="1947857">That is the extent of disclosure obligations that Congress has set forth and that the Interior Department by regulation has implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.718" offset="1979308">Now, to the -- to the extent that your question suggests that the tribes may need more in order to enforce those enforcement duties, I think the -- the account statements and the annual audit goes a long way towards suggesting that if there is a problem, then the tribe may want to try to enforce those duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.614" offset="2054855">The other point I would make is, although the legally enforceable duties under this Court's decisions in Mitchell and Navajo Nation are those set forth by statute and regulation, that doesn't mean the Interior Department doesn't have discretion to provide more information.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.123" offset="2116921">And in fact, in practice, the Interior Department does provide a much broader swath of information to the Indian tribes regarding these accounts than the two discrete pieces of information that the statutes set forth.</text>

            <label>Mr. Pratik A. Shah</label>
            <text syncTime="520.735" offset="2187348">Your Honor, the United States does not contest the existence of a fiduciary exception in certain private trust contexts where the criteria for that exception are satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.459" offset="2230188">So the answer is no, we don't, we don't dispute the existence in certain contexts under certain circumstances of a fiduciary exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.029" offset="2256520">So if this cause arose in a different context with a different trustee, the position of the United States would be that under Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence there is a fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege?</text>

            <text syncTime="551.806" offset="2311586">It would depend on the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.756" offset="2319423">For example, if it were a private trust and the factors that -- in which the courts, the old English cases, for example, have recognized where the fiduciary exception applies, that is the information is sought solely for the benefit of the beneficiary, the expenses for that legal advice are paid out of the trust corpus, and as a result of that, the resulting legal advice and the resulting records belong to the trust corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.487" offset="2410329">All of those things give right, as the old English cases say, give right to a common law right of access for the beneficiary to access those.</text>

            <text syncTime="607.107" offset="2532791">The Court can assume it arguendo and then go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.726" offset="2543344">I think the critical point here is, though, that all of the factors that underlie that -- that exception in the private trustee concept are absent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.831" offset="2583677">Here the government is acting out of its own interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="660.324" offset="2745741">But when you're just talking about managing funds, what competing interests can there be in practical terms?</text>

            <text syncTime="679.103" offset="2820765">Let me provide two responses, Justice Alito.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.155" offset="2829019">First, I think as a formal position I don't think our position turns, as a formal matter, on the existence of a specific competing duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.059" offset="2860680">I think such a rule would overlook the ways in which the U.S. inherently, United States inherently differs from a private trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.764" offset="2891504">And I think that's especially true in the light of the complex multifaceted ways in which the government interacts with Indians and Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.270" offset="2921493">Those sovereign obligations extend to law -- providing law enforcement, educational duties, health services.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.424" offset="2946048">One subset of those duties are the type of trust responsibilities at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.078" offset="2968722">Now, to be more concrete, I think, even putting aside that larger framework which may create tensions between the United States and with -- and the Indian tribes in certain circumstances, I think even in the trust fund, purely in the trust fund context that we're talking about, there could be at least tensions that arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.307" offset="3045627">For example, the D.C. Circuit in the Cobell case when it talked about the accounting obligation that it imposed on the government, it made clear that it's not the same accounting obligation that would apply at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.132" offset="3100902">And the reason the D.C. Circuit gave was because the United States would be taking that -- performing that obligation at the expense of taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.738" offset="3139354">There are budgetary constraints that the United States must take into consideration as a sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.356" offset="3157849">Maybe that's not a specific competing obligation in the formal sense, but I think it's -- it's a factor that distinguishes the United States from a private fiduciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.629" offset="3190868">Also, there are -- for example in our brief we discuss one of, just as an example, one of the documents at issue in this case, which involves a judgment by a tribal court seeking to attach funds from an individual Indian money account.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.388" offset="3253979">The United States acts as a trustee with respect to that individual -- Indian account.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.827" offset="3279684">It may be the case that the United States consistent with its fiduciary obligations in that sense could simply pay out the judgment, but I think there would be room for the United States to take a closer look at the judgment, to make sure that it complies with, for example, the Indian Civil Rights Act or basic due process--</text>

            <text syncTime="1056.549" offset="4330642">So in the hypothetical, the original hypothetical that you posed in the corporation or the bank that was acting as a trustee, there the trustee is simply acting out of its fiduciary obligation solely to benefit the beneficiary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.148" offset="4533039">The factors that -- even assuming a common law trustee, the fiduciary exception doesn't apply automatically at all common law trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.021" offset="4568461">There's several things that underlie that fiduciary exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.039" offset="4580582">One, the -- the -- the advice sought is typically paid for out of the trust corpus, and as a result of that fact, the trust itself owns the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.014" offset="4628438">Those are the principal two factors that the cases recognizing a fiduciary exception rely upon to create a common law right of access of the beneficiary to such records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.739" offset="4675354">None of those factors are present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.773" offset="4687475">The government pays for these -- for -- for the cost of administration, including legal advice, out of congressionally appropriated funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.777" offset="4715478">The records resulting from that advice belonged to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.914" offset="4732092">The government owns those records, both as a matter of statute and regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.133" offset="4748915">And the disclosure of those records is subject to a highly reticulated regime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1350.871" offset="5507929">And -- and -- and of course, this issue could arise in any of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.958" offset="5532275">Let me get back to one of Justice Sotomayor's questions, the -- the initial question about the fact that the Congress has used the term "trust".</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.564" offset="5566652">I think as a matter of precedent, both the Mitchell decisions and the Navajo Nation decisions, I think those are binding, controlling precedent, and the Court should not deviate from those precedents that say a statute or regulation must define the duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.806" offset="5619628">But beyond the binding nature of those precedents, I think they make sense from first principles as well, and let me try to explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.877" offset="5651916">The -- the -- the term "trust" has been used by both Congress and the courts in a variety of ways, often in a variety of imprecise ways, when it comes to the relationship between the United States and Indians and Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.987" offset="5708340">Courts and Congress have used the term when it comes to providing law enforcement, when it comes to providing educational services, health services, none of which are really the type of private common law trust that we know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.694" offset="5755152">And even in scenarios where there is a discrete property interest that might bring us closer to the common law context, this Court has used -- this Court and Congress has recognized that "trust" can mean a lot of different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.454" offset="5810218">It can mean the type of bare trust that was at issue in Mitchell 1, the Indian General Allotment Act, when the trust was really simply to avoid alienation of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.643" offset="5846998">It may mean specific investment duties, as we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.779" offset="5863508">But the point is that there is no "one size fits all" trust terminology, and so that's why it makes sense for this Court to require Congress to set forth the specific duties and statutes, and the Interior Department to set forth specific duties and regulations before it implies such a sweeping obligation on the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.008" offset="5944383">I think it also flows from a more general principle of a reluctance to hold the United States to common law duties when there's an existing statutory and regulatory regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.400" offset="5985970">I think for all of those reasons, not only as a matter of precedent, but as -- as a matter of principle, I think the -- the -- the fiduciary exception would -- would not apply here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3360.810" offset="13547687">Your Honor, if I can just make three -- three points on rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.880" offset="13567958">The first is with respect to Federal Rule of Evidence 501.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.015" offset="13580497">The government is not implementing any trick here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.700" offset="13591155">This is not a</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.400" offset="13593976">"heads you win, tails you lose. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.319" offset="13601708">type situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.252" offset="13605366">Our argument is simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.252" offset="13609441">We look to -- we invoke a valid attorney-client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.490" offset="13630339">The other side invokes a common law exception to that privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.442" offset="13646117">Our argument is not that no common law exception is applicable to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.162" offset="13661059">It's simply that the basis for this common law exception is not applicable, so the exception should not be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.566" offset="13686659">It's a very straightforward argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.050" offset="13692615">The second point I would like to make is in response to the contention that we have a full-fledged trust here as opposed to a bare trust in Mitchell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.856" offset="13727828">I'm not quite sure what "a full-fledged trust" means in the Indian trust context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.259" offset="13745382">Certainly there's specific investment-related duties that the statute sets forth with respect to trust funds, but this Court has made clear in -- in Mitchell and reiterated in the Navajo Nation decision that it's not enough for the statute to simply set forth the statutory duties, but it must define, and this is a quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.537" offset="13822495">"define the contours of those duties. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.423" offset="13834094">The statutes at issue, section 161a, 162a, do nothing of the sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.929" offset="13864082">They don't even set out a general disclosure obligation, let alone the contours of any such disclosure obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.083" offset="13888742">But even if we were to disregard this Court's precedents in Mitchell and in Navajo Nation, and we were to resort to the common law to flesh out the nature of the responsibilities, again there's nothing from the discrete investment obligations that are set forth in those statutes that would lead to a general disclosure obligation, let alone an intrusive obligation to disclose the government's attorney-client communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.614" offset="13982887">And there's good reasons to think that Congress did not apply such an obligation when it has set forth a fairly reticulated statutory and regulatory regime governing disclosures, and with respect to other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.422" offset="14034087">For example, the 1982 Indian Claims Limitation Act specifically addressed privileged versus nonprivileged information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.777" offset="14063553">The last point I would make goes to the general duty to disclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.931" offset="14084138">Whether that's contingent simply on payment, ownership or other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.717" offset="14099289">While it may not be the case that the payment is the sole factor, it's certainly an important factor, and I think as my friend responded in response to Justice Kennedy, if in fact the private trustee is paying for the legal advice on their own, that's going to be a significant consideration as to whether the beneficiary can get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.862" offset="14175880">And as Justice Scalia pointed out, the lines are not always going to be clear between trust administration advice and liability advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.868" offset="14203883">In fact, they're often going to run into one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.153" offset="14217049">Beyond payment, I think the even more important factor here is the ownership of the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.140" offset="14240977">While payment is indicative of ownership, when we're talking about the government context, payment is not the only reason why we say that the government owns the records that result from legal advice or any other trust administration facet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.114" offset="14288833">That's set forth by statute and regulation, the Federal Records Act, and the Interior Department regulations that are set forth in the appendix of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.268" offset="14317464">The reason why I think--</text>

            <text syncTime="3572.948" offset="14396144">And I think that's a fundamental distinction here, that we're not -- because the -- these are governmental records, they're subject to the statutory and regulatory regime that governs disclosure of government documents, either specific disclosure obligations set forth by Congress, Interior Department regulation or the more general Freedom of Information Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3598.249" offset="14497395">FOIA itself doesn't make these records less -- the government doesn't own them less merely because FOIA requires them to share it with other people.</text>

            <text syncTime="3615.392" offset="14565940">The fact that they're accessible by FOIA does not -- does not change the government's ownership of those records, but the fact that Congress is able to set forth a scheme like FOIA is turned on the fact that these are government records that are owned by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.304" offset="14637620">Because they're government records, it's Congress and it's the Interior Department that decides when to disclose them and under what circumstances to disclose them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.362" offset="14673878">The tribe's rule here would eviscerate that very reticulated statutory and regulatory regime.</text>
