            <label>Mr. Matthew D. Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="5.987" offset="129400">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.087" offset="133789">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.189" offset="142148">To accommodate important pretrial proceedings, the Speedy Trial Act contains several automatic exclusions from its deadline for commencing trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.712" offset="176316">This case concerns the exclusion for pretrial motions, which excludes the period of delay resulting from any pretrial motion from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on or other prompt disposition of such motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.554" offset="235666">For more than 30 years, the courts of appeals had uniformly held that the exclusion applies automatically upon the filing of any motion, regardless of its effect on the trial schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.077" offset="281746">The court below correctly rejected that established rule, which accords with this Court's decisions, is clear and easy to administer, and has worked well for over 3 decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.885" offset="328976">The Court's cases construing the exclusion, Henderson and Bloate, support the established rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.323" offset="354680">They make clear that the exclusion applies automatically once a motion is filed without any need for district court findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.310" offset="386654">Henderson and Bloate cannot be squared with the approach of Respondent and the court below.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="75.298" stopTime="86.939">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="75.298" offset="406612">Well, all that might be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.833" offset="416747">On the other hand, the statute does say "delay resulting".</text>
            <text syncTime="80.868" offset="428868">And under your approach, the time would be excluded even if delay does not result.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="matthew_d_roberts" startTime="86.939" stopTime="123.395">
            <label>Mr. Matthew D. Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="86.939" offset="453214">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.289" offset="458543">Delay refers to the interval of time from the filing of the motion through its disposition, during which the Speedy Trial Act's deadline is tolled.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.580" offset="503787">We know that delay has the meaning -- delay can often have the meaning of the interval of time between two events.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.769" offset="532522">And we know it has that meaning in the statute here because subsection (D) tells us so.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.756" offset="556450">It defines the period of excludable delay resulting from the motion as the time from the filing through the disposition of the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.612" offset="591872">Respondent's definition--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="123.395" stopTime="133.503">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="123.395" offset="598977">But the Chief Justice says only if it -- it's really a circular argument -- only if it results in a delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.301" offset="626667">Well, suppose it doesn't result in a delay?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="matthew_d_roberts" startTime="133.503" stopTime="179.416">
            <label>Mr. Matthew D. Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="133.503" offset="639415">--That's assuming that delay is referring to delay of the trial, to a postponement in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.074" offset="669717">But delay can't have that meaning because if it has that -- if that meaning is inconsistent with subsection (D) of the statute's exclusion of the time, of saying that delay is the time from the filing of the motion through the disposition of the motion, because the statute excludes periods of delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.404" offset="751010">And if delay meant postponement of the trial, then the excluded period would be the time during which trial is postponed, but that period is often significantly shorter or longer than the time from the filing of the motion to the disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.782" offset="816525">And in Henderson and Bloate--</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="179.416" stopTime="190.506">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="179.416" offset="823108">But that doesn't -- that prove the point that I think is the concern of the Chief Justice's question, that in some cases the delay -- there's a delay that results and in other cases there isn't.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="matthew_d_roberts" startTime="190.506" stopTime="295.859">
            <label>Mr. Matthew D. Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="190.506" offset="867412">--But, Your Honor, the statute excludes the period of delay, and then it says the period of delay is the time from the filing through the disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.897" offset="912969">If delay -- if delay means postponement of the trial, then all that's excluded by the statute in the first part is the -- is the time during which trial is postponed, but that doesn't match up with subsection (D) because that period is not necessarily the period from the filing through the disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.929" offset="1005129">If I could give you an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.979" offset="1009309">Say a motion is filed 14 days before trial could begin, and the motion takes 16 days to resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.237" offset="1058419">Trial is postponed only by two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.522" offset="1071480">And so if delay means the postponement of trial, then the period of delay should be 2 days, but the statute says that the delay and the excludable time is the time from the filing through the disposition, which is 16 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.699" offset="1124248">And that's what this Court held in Henderson and Bloate, that that's the exact time.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.770" offset="1148489">So if you adopt a definition of delay for the first part as a triggering mechanism that's the postponement of trial, that doesn't line up with the rest of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.660" offset="1200107">In addition, that would be a totally unworkable rule because whether time is excludable would turn on a complex and often uncertain analysis of whether the motion would or could delay when trial would begin, and it's often going to be difficult or impossible to make that determination at the time that the motion is filed.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="295.859" offset="1288819">Mr. Roberts, is there -- is there any, anything to indicate that what Congress might have had in mind is that in criminal cases inevitably there are going to be motions, and so the trial judge is likely to set the trial date for after that period runs?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="matthew_d_roberts" startTime="319.058" stopTime="473.558">
            <label>Mr. Matthew D. Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="319.058" offset="1381606">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.524" offset="1387562">Sometimes trial -- judges might take motions into account in setting the trial date and other times they might not take the motions into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.497" offset="1423402">So a rule that -- that said the exclusion only applies if the judge moves the trial date in response to the motion would lead to arbitrary results.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.270" offset="1462481">It would mean basically that whether time was excludable depended on whether the judge took the motions into account when it set the trial date initially or whether the, whether the judge correctly estimated the amount of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.695" offset="1520159">And also sometimes motions may be filed when no trial date is set, so the rule would be totally unworkable in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.551" offset="1551611">And Respondent, in one of his formulations for what the test might be, suggests that a motion wouldn't create excludable delay unless it would postpone the hypothetical earliest date on which trial could otherwise begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.847" offset="1616812">That's just a totally unworkable rule, because to divine that hypothetical date, courts would have to assess the effect of multiple different factors that could affect when trial would begin, such as: How much time do the parties and the counsel need for factual investigation and legal analysis?</text>
            <text syncTime="397.808" offset="1696643">How long is discovery going to take?</text>
            <text syncTime="399.593" offset="1703748">There would be numerous questions that would arise about how to apply those factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.997" offset="1725377">For example, the courts would have to decide: Should they take potential obstacles to an earlier trial as given, or should they instead think about whether those obstacles could be eliminated?</text>
            <text syncTime="416.805" offset="1772607">The courts would also have to figure out what to do if the earliest possible trial date changed between when the motion was filed and when the motion was resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.612" offset="1819836">And how would they take into account other periods of time that might exclude delay -- might exclude -- that might be excludable also?</text>
            <text syncTime="439.385" offset="1862990">For example, say a court gets two motions filed at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.305" offset="1886605">Trial could start in 5 days absent the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.193" offset="1906145">One motion's going to take 3 days to resolve; the other motion's going to take 4 days to resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.680" offset="1924117">What's the court supposed to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="456.830" offset="1932790">Is one -- is the 3-day motion excluded?</text>
            <text syncTime="459.965" offset="1945328">Is the 4-day motion excluded?</text>
            <text syncTime="461.917" offset="1953061">Are both of the motions excluded?</text>
            <text syncTime="463.953" offset="1961211">Does it depend on the order in which the court decides them?</text>
            <text syncTime="467.988" offset="1977407">It just is not possible for a court to make these determinations.</text>

            <text syncTime="476.343" offset="2010843">Of course, the whole point of the Act was to hold district judges to a pretty strict standard, and the concern is that there might be a very complex case the judge just really wants to put off as long as possible and will continue to accept motion after motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1610.027" offset="6545492">Before turning to the substance, I would like to, if I may, start with the procedural question that Justice Sotomayor raised and that -- and that my opponent just completed with, because I want to be sure there's no confusion on the posture of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.704" offset="6596274">In particular, this Court's precedents squarely reject the notion that there's any history in this Court's precedents for refusing to reach an argument in this posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.892" offset="6640995">In particular, in Langness v. Green, 282 U.S. 531, this Court held in 1931 that a Respondent's, quote, "right" to defend a judgment below on a ground that is properly preserved all along and that the lower court reached and rejected is, quote, "beyond successful challenge".</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.389" offset="6723020">Now, I'm not sure -- I'm not aware of any exception from that rule in the 80 years since.</text>

            <text syncTime="1660.293" offset="6746634">Suppose the petition here had simply raised one question, and that is the question of how you count time under -- under a version of Rule 45 of the Federal Rules Of Criminal Procedure that is not -- no longer in effect and as to which there is no conflict in the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.123" offset="6825942">How would you grade the chances of the Court taking cert on that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="1685.194" offset="6846213">Well, I'll take your hypothetical, Justice Alito, but I do want to be able to correct the notion that it's of no longer continuing importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.431" offset="6871186">But I'll assume that your hypothetical on that kind of a question would be cert denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.383" offset="6886964">But that's never been an obstacle to reaching the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.002" offset="6897413">Let me give you two things that are very important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.037" offset="6905563">The first is the problem with the Government's citation to Nobles is not just a distinction between discretion and law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.941" offset="6933149">If you look at the Solicitor General's own reply brief in that case, it pointed out that the problem with the alternative argument there was that it would give the defendant different relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.213" offset="6970243">So it was therefore subject to the cross-petitions rule, and that's the section in Stern and Gressman that's cited in their briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.950" offset="6997201">Those are the only two citations they have, the citations to Nobles and the citations to Stern and Gressman, which are all about cross-petitions when the defendant wants different relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.389" offset="7035026">We want exactly the same relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.239" offset="7042341">We want a dismissal on the Speedy Trial Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.924" offset="7053103">So finally, even if it were somehow discretionary and this Court were to consider in this case breaking from its unbroken precedent of 80 years -- let me give you one more example before I turn to the discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.434" offset="7107124">In the Walling case in 1947, this Court reached as an alternative ground the defendant's argument that there was insufficient evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.373" offset="7142964">Now, that's sort of the quintessential un-cert-worthy question, but this Court felt required to reach it because the lower court had reached it and rejected it and the defendant had preserved it all along in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.329" offset="7186745">And in the Union Pacific case in 2009 -- I can keep giving you citations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.466" offset="7207330">But let me just say, even if it were discretionary, you would still want to reach it in this case, because at pages 18 and 19 of the Solicitor General's brief there are citations to a circuit split on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.274" offset="7254559">And the new Rule 45 hasn't made that go away for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.559" offset="7271696">The first is because the Solicitor General's own argument now doesn't depend on Rule 45.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.962" offset="7293221">Instead, it's that the Speedy Trial Act on its own terms counts 10 business days, not simply calendar days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.318" offset="7322687">And, second, there continue to be decisions after the amendment of Rule 45 in which lower courts have said that this provision means only 10 business days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.674" offset="7360094">Let me give you one more citation, and forgive me for this because we didn't get to file a reply brief in this case on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.328" offset="7382768">But the Zabawa case, 2010 Westlaw, 307-5044, is a case in the Eastern District of Michigan last summer where the Government's own filing, which we looked at on PACER, asked the court to apply Tinklenberg and hold that subsection (F) meant only ten business days.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1838.123" offset="7457896">If I could just come back to where you started before you go on to these additional points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.908" offset="7473048">Your argument is that if the Government petitions for cert on one issue that's a legal issue on which there's a conflict in the circuits and the Respondent in a criminal case says that the -- asks to have the decision below affirmed on 15 other grounds, we -- and raises those in the bio, we take the case anyway, we are duty-bound to decide every one of those 15 grounds?</text>

            <text syncTime="1865.726" offset="7568342">You're not duty-bound to decide it, Justice Alito.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.093" offset="7577746">But I do think under this Court's precedent, at least, you have never reversed the decision below without reaching them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.880" offset="7600943">So you may well affirm on the question presented or some one or two of those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.033" offset="7621528">You may also dismiss the case as improvidently granted, which happens sometimes in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.437" offset="7639186">Of course, what ordinarily what would happen is when the cert -- when the ops was filed this Court would realize there was a serious obstacle to reaching the question and might well deny cert in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.841" offset="7672832">But as I said, there's no decision on this Court's books and certainly the Solicitor General hasn't appointed one where you've reversed and reinstated a conviction or, in fact, reversed and done anything to a Respondent in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.268" offset="7730510">Now, let me turn to the merits of the ten day argument and make a few points before I'm sure the Court might want to talk about the pretrial motions issue as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.457" offset="7763216">There's a few important points to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.075" offset="7773769">Now, remember, the Solicitor General has now basically abandoned the Sixth Circuit's view that Rule 45 automatically gets incorporated into the Speedy Trial Act and now they're making the making the argument that what Congress intended in the Speedy Trial Act was somehow for Rule 45 to operate as some background principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.203" offset="7842210">So that the meaning of the Act, I guess, would wax and wane according to what Rule 45 said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.941" offset="7865198">Now, there's two versions of this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.559" offset="7875647">I can't tell which it's making.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.593" offset="7879826">First it could be saying that what Congress meant when it passed subsection F in 1979 was that whatever the rule is in Rule 45 right now, that's what we expect to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.332" offset="7918696">Well, that can't possibly be the Solicitor General's argument because in 1979 Rule 45, consistent with the traditional rule, excluded weekends and holidays only for periods of less than seven days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.306" offset="7962687">That wasn't changed until 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.524" offset="7975539">So the Congress at the time, even if they had cared about Rule 45, wouldn't have, wouldn't have thought you counted, excluded weekends and holidays here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1975.780" offset="8008558">Why wouldn't Congress think, we have a bunch of statutes that have times and we have a bunch that don't and the ones that don't, they should be interpreted into the Federal rule, that Rule 45?</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.076" offset="8077730">I think the much more natural reading, Justice Ginsburg, in light of the traditional rule, which is not just cited in Am.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.312" offset="8102703">Jur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.862" offset="8104897">, please understand, this is a cannon of common law, traditional construction of time periods that goes back to Sutherland's treatise in 1904.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.418" offset="8135095">There's a Second Circuit case called Morasca in 1921, 277 F. 2727, I could cite you 20 or 30 state cases all up and down the last century.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.524" offset="8179503">So the common law rule has always been for periods of less than seven days -- I'm sorry, for periods of more than seven days, it's up to the legislature to expressly tell the court to exclude weekends and holidays.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.849" offset="8224852">And if you look at the U.S. Code, it's perfectly consistent with that common law understanding because when Congress wanted, such as in the Bail Reform Act, to exclude weekends and holidays from a ten day period, it expressly says so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.639" offset="8271976">Now, we cited three or four examples in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.758" offset="8284411">Again, this is at page 40, 41 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.460" offset="8295278">I could have cited 15 or 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.078" offset="8301756">So the U.S. Code is quite clear and I think the much more natural inference its that when Congress wanted to exclude weekends and holidays consistent with the traditional rule, it felt duty bound to say so in the U.S. Code, and when it hasn't, it wants simply calendar days -- now, if you want confirmation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2112.284" offset="8554517">But Congress went through, most recently about a year and a half ago, and amended various provisions of the U.S. Code according to whether it wanted weekends or holidays excluded or times enlarged, and it left this alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="2161.696" offset="8752212">Remember, we have not just this alternative argument, we have a second alternative argument, which is that the time in relation to Mr. Tinklenberg's competency hearing exceeded the 30 day provision in section 4247 in the Insanity Defense Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.687" offset="8808218">Now, I don't think you have to get to that argument, you can simply affirm on the ten day issue, but, again, let's think about what the Solicitor General is arguing with respect to the ten day issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.895" offset="8844999">They're saying that Congress sub silentio, without saying anything at all in the Speedy Trial Act, somehow assumed that the time in subsection F would wax and wane according to this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.585" offset="8887735">Well, if that's -- even though the rule didn't even apply to statutes at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.488" offset="8903408">Well, if that's the case, then I don't think there's any basis for arguing that Congress would have had exactly the same assumption with respect to another Federal statute, that is the Insanity Defense Reform Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2530.949" offset="10229175">But if you disagree with me on that and you want to have a rigid textual reading of the statute resulting from only meaning 10 days, I think that's your only other option.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.686" offset="10260208">Because, if I could ask the Court, or at least direct the Court to page 6 of the Solicitor General's reply brief, this is where they give -- because I think what the government wants to do is pose these difficult hypotheticals, and the sort of difficult question you just raised, Justice Alito, and have this Court respond by saying, oh, we're just going to throw the words "delay resulting from" out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.100" offset="10345785">Because there's only two definitions, two ways to deal with what the Solicitor General offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.552" offset="10363653">First, they say that delay means time, and I think ordinary -- in ordinary English language, "delay" means something more than time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.192" offset="10402210">It means postponement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.375" offset="10406912">So then the fallback argument -- this is the second paragraph on page 6 -- is that the occurrence that is postponed is the STA's deadline for commencing trial, and our suggestion is that that begs the whole question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.417" offset="10455082">That can't possibly be right, because the whole reason that you're looking to subsection (d) to apply it is to ask whether you should exclude the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2690.985" offset="10869384">In subsection 7, which is at (4)(a) of the government's appendix, I think is another way of showing that it can't possibly -- even if it weren't begging the question, it can't possibly be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.208" offset="10918285">It has to be talking about the trial itself, because this is the continuance -- the end of the justice continuance section.</text>

            <text syncTime="2718.218" offset="10978262">Now, it's very clear that in that section, "period" -- "period of delay resulting from" can't mean that we've already said that the clock is stopped, because there's an "if" clause that gives you certain things that have to be satisfied in order to exclude it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.145" offset="11038030">So I think starting with the very title of the Act we're talking about, the Speedy Trial Act, and the -- the idea of the words "delay resulting from" can only sensibly mean delay resulting from trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2871.533" offset="11591513">It's also possible to read those words "delay resulting from" as simply referring to a period of time; and the statute is saying these periods of time are excluded from accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.609" offset="11647833">Now, the virtue of that is just what Justice Ginsburg started with; all the trial judges know how to do it; the lawyers don't get mixed up; and the problem with what you're arguing for, in my mind -- if you want to say anything more about it, do -- is that it seems very unworkable to strike trying to figure out what causes what.</text>

            <text syncTime="2907.641" offset="11736022">First, with all due respect, I have to disagree with your premise that it's possible to read the statute the way the Solicitor General wants to read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.378" offset="11762981">Now I'll accept for purposes of responding to your question, let's imagine that it were possible to read it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.782" offset="11784505">I think our rule is not as difficult to administer as you think it might be in the -- NACDL brief LDY.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.436" offset="11815121">And indeed the Solicitor General -- this has been the -- this has been the law in -- in the Sixth Circuit for 17 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.804" offset="11836646">They haven't pointed to a single dismissal as a result of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.840" offset="11848767">Now let me take the other side, and this brings us to the dialogue during Mr. Roberts' argument; the Solicitor General's rule isn't so easy, either, unless you simply cease caring at all about the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.147" offset="11890040">You could have a perfectly administrable rule that says every singly motion, no matter what the circumstances, tolls the clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.967" offset="11917312">But that's not the law in the First Circuit, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.186" offset="11930164">They're made clear as Justice Sotomayor said that if a motion is filed to frustrate the speedy trial clock, then we're not going to exclude it; and that makes perfect sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.775" offset="11960571">I mean, look at this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.342" offset="11966840">And I'm not going to suggest there was any ill will or bad faith in this case; but the facts of the case illustrate the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.548" offset="11995575">On August 1st, trial date was set for August 14th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.333" offset="12014801">There were 14 days before the trial was going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.368" offset="12026922">Yet there were only -- even under the best reading there were only 10 days left on the clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.706" offset="12048238">So if no motions had been filed, unquestionably we would have a Speedy Trial Act violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.093" offset="12069763">So the government's whole case hinges on the fact that because it filed this purely administrative motion to bring a gun into the courtroom, a motion I might add that at the pretrial conference the judge had already told the government was going to be granted, and so I don't know why it couldn't have been made at the moment the evidence was introduced; and one other administration motion, then the Speedy Trial Act isn't violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.673" offset="12156071">And to borrow the Solicitor General's own phrase from page 38 of his brief, that outcome bears no relation to the Act's purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.577" offset="12183761">So what you have to do to have, I think, the government's argument be at all faithful, even if it were possible under the language -- have it be at all faithful with the purpose of the Act, is to have some kind of exception for motions that frustrate, motions that are pretextual, motions that are purely administrative, however it would be defined.</text>

            <text syncTime="3315.933" offset="13369198">First I would like to stress that the government thinks that it's very important that the Court address the question that we raised in our cert petition, and that the Court granted certiorari to answer, on which there's a split in the circuits and which we believe that if it's left standing will result in serious disruption to the Speedy Trial Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.596" offset="13451849">Turning to -- to that question, a few points first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.965" offset="13465328">Respondent's definition of delay is plainly inconsistent with Henderson which already holds that the period of delay that's excludable is the time between the filing of the motion and the disposition of the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.808" offset="13516633">That can't be squared with the notion that delay is the period during which trial is postponed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.177" offset="13538158">Second, Respondent's definition of delay gives delay a different meaning in the first part of the statute and in subsection D, where this Court's already held that it has the meaning that we suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.769" offset="13592492">Third, Respondent's test is totally unworkable, because you can't tell at the time a motion is filed how much time it's going to take to resolve and whether trial is going to be postponed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.410" offset="13635020">District Court judges have over 500 pending cases on their docket, an average District Court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.862" offset="13656858">A hundred of them are criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.064" offset="13661665">The court -- the Speedy Trial Act cannot function if the judges are going to have to make a complex judicial determination in each case to determine whether each motion is excludable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.241" offset="13718403">Respondent says that NACDL says defendants won't object or that they'll stipulate to the exclusion of time, but NACDL also says that defendants may change their mind if the case goes to trial, and if they change their mind and file a motion to dismiss under the Speedy Trial Act, their prior failures to object and stipulations may very well not be binding because this Court held in Zedner that defendants can prospectively waive the application of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.093" offset="13837834">And Respondent's tests would also throw the established way that the Speedy Trial Act has been operating for over 30 years into disarray.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.199" offset="13878168">Turning to whether this Court has to address the alternative arguments for affirmance, Nobles plainly says that the Court has discretion not to address those issues if those issues are not independently worthy of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.410" offset="13943056">It doesn't base that on the fact that the -- on the fact that the argument would expand the judgment below, and the rule that it's discretionary makes sense, because the contrary rule would require the court to address numerous issues that are not important and -- in every case where they're raised, and would also lead the court to either dismiss writs as improvidently granted or to address only as dicta important issues on which the Court has granted certiorari.</text>
