            <text syncTime="12.666" offset="156045">The dismissal of an employee is often the result of the interrelated actions and decisions of several officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="122.667" offset="596052">Not everything that's done, not -- just writing up a bad report for a biased reason is not actionable under this statute; isn't that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="133.024" offset="637534">But a decision to -- the decision to dismiss an official is -- can be, and is here, the result, cumulative result, of a series of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.141" offset="681942">It's not unlike what occurs in the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.511" offset="703467">Only a sentencing judge can send a defendant to prison, but that decision actually is a result of a series of other decisions, all of which are government action.</text>

            <text syncTime="168.381" offset="778909">If your theory is correct, I don't know why that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.051" offset="793642">I don't know why a co-employee who has a hostile motivation and makes a report to the supervisor who ultimately dismisses the individual, why that -- that wouldn't qualify as well.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="188.276" offset="858530">--Well, our standard is not whether it's a supervisor, but whether it's an official for whom the employer is liable under agency law.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.005" offset="889459">That would not be every supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.802" offset="896669">If a supervisor unrelated to this particular department put a false charge in a suggestion box, that wouldn't be any different.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.673" offset="944107">Ordinarily, a coworker wouldn't qualify under agency principles as an agent of the employer when engaging in that conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.576" offset="979738">You have to look at the specific conduct and apply the traditional agency standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.228" offset="998337">They are laid out, for example, in the Court's decision in Ellerth, which refers to the two branches of agency law: Scope of employment, and action which is aided in, where the actor was aided in the conduct by his or her official position.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.005" offset="1061449">And I think those principles would not ordinarily apply to a coworker, but they would also not apply invariably to a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.204" offset="1098230">This is not -- we are not advocating the supervisor versus non-supervisor distinction in Ellerth, but a return to just the traditional agency doctrines.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.823" offset="1140757">And we think those doctrines delineate who is the employer for the purposes of the statute, which bans action by the employer.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="288.856" offset="1260816">But it's -- it's the core responsibility of -- in terms of scope of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.448" offset="1283176">It's the core responsibility of a supervisor of a particular individual to be monitoring his or her behavior, reporting on it, perhaps initiating disciplinary matters -- measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.163" offset="1326122">That wouldn't be true of all supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.445" offset="1335212">It's only true of Mr. Staub's supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.504" offset="1343467">So -- what -- the kind of thing they did was the kind of work that they were employed to engage in, and that distinguishes them from, say, another supervisor who might slip a note into a suggestion box.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.454" offset="1395190">Second, the other branch, major branch, of agency law is that an employer is liable for actions of individuals when their conduct -- when they are aided in their conduct by their official position, which would not typically be true of a fellow worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.041" offset="1465616">But that could be true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.632" offset="1471990">For example, Mulally set much of this in motion when, on the plaintiff's version of the facts, she issued the January 27th corrective order.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.564" offset="1511696">Everyone agrees she wrote it.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.421" offset="1519114">She signed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.951" offset="1521204">She was aided in doing that by her position as a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.232" offset="1538341">A coworker couldn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.356" offset="1542834">And indeed, somebody else's supervisor couldn't have done that.</text>
