            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.755" offset="128460">Scott Pinholster and two accomplices broke into a house in the middle of the night.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.285" offset="146536">They brutally beat and stabbed to death two men who happened to interrupt the burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.235" offset="166390">A California jury convicted Pinholster of first degree murder and he was sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.030" offset="193557">Pinholster twice sought habeas relief in the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.123" offset="213932">One of his claims was that his trial counsel had failed to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.435" offset="259176">Both times, the California Supreme Court unanimously and summarily denied Pinholster's claim on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.451" offset="291255">Later, a Federal District Judge held in evidentiary hearing and granted Pinholster Federal habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. 2254.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.499" offset="335454">Sitting en banc, the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.192" offset="350187">Considering new evidence introduced in the District Court, the Court of Appeals held that the California Supreme Court's decision, “Involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law under Section 2254(d)(1).”</text>
            <text syncTime="79.511" offset="423434">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.674" offset="444123">The Ninth Circuit was wrong to consider the evidence introduced in the District Court under Section 2254(d)(1) when a Federal Court reviews whether a state court unreasonably applied federal law, the Federal Court may consider only the record that was before the state court although state prisoners may sometimes submit new evidence in Federal Court, any new evidence is not relevant to review under Section 2254(d)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="116.797" offset="572646">Looking only at the state record, we find that the California Supreme Court reasonably applied, clearly established federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.714" offset="608277">The clearly established law here is Strickland versus Washington which provides that counsel is constitutionally ineffective only when a defendant shows both defective performance and prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.429" offset="667105">The California Supreme Court could have reasonably concluded on the record before it that Pinholster could not satisfy either requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.448" offset="707229">Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan both are -- both only joined Part II of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.582" offset="739725">Justice Alito has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.638" offset="763967">Justice Breyer has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.Justice Sotomayor has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan joined in part.</text>
