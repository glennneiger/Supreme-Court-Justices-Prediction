            <text syncTime="11.689" offset="152179">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.026" offset="165554">In 2005 when Congress passed the Bankruptcy Act, it made a policy decision to limit judicial discretion on a case-by-case basis in the area of reasonable and necessary expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.852" offset="228874">It did so by creating a formula that entails an aggregate set amount of expenses for an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.243" offset="274432">Now, Congress could have created this from scratch.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.362" offset="290837">It could have used an arbitrary figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.314" offset="298674">But instead, there are figures that the IRS already had, based on Census Bureau statistics, that said nationwide, in a certain area, an individual would spend this much a month on average.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.305" offset="346634">In the case of Mr. Ransom, that's approximately 2500 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.692" offset="368159">Forgetting about how it's divided up, if I had 100 people come in and answer the following five questions the same way Mr. Ransom did, and that's age, location, household size, gross income, and if you have a vehicle, how many, they would all get $2,500 standard aggregate deduction, which works out to $150,000 over a five-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.343" offset="474843">Now, the crux of this is whether or not courts are allowed to dig in and cut out pieces of the standard aggregate amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="937.994" offset="3857387">Plus, the fact that you own a car, the IRS under its discretion can take away the operating costs if it's on four cinder blocks in your backyard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2355.440" offset="9527212">I say, Justice Breyer, that there is nothing in the statute or the legislative history that suggests that this was meant to be an overall budget for above-median income debtors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.430" offset="9555111">This was about capping upper discretion and limiting the expenses available as reasonably necessary expenses for above-median income debtors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.850" offset="9584786">And I think that point is made perfectly clear by the fact that you can compare it to what happens now to a below-median income debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.985" offset="9605371">A below-median income debtor in the same situation as Petitioner, who owns his car outright, would be allowed no amount as an expense for his vehicle, because he doesn't have an actual expense that's reasonably necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.144" offset="9662004">And I think that the 2005 Congress would think it was a senseless result, as they argue here, that Petitioner gets $471, above-median income debtor, the very class of debtors with whom Congress was concerned in the 2005 amendment, to shield from his creditors over the life of the plan when he has no comparable expense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2466.409" offset="9971085">The first is that it makes clear -- in the back of our brief, we have the other necessary expenses from the IRM.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.863" offset="9996894">And on -- near the back, page 25a, two of the categories of other necessary expenses are secured or legally perfected debts and unsecured debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.404" offset="10039003">So I think the -- the otherwise -- the "notwithstanding" sentence makes clear that Romanette ii should not capture those other unsecured debts and secured debts that is the whole purpose of this calculation, to figure out how much money you have to pay those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.580" offset="10103787">The second purpose the sentence serves is to make sure that there is no double-counting, because Romanette iii, the very next provision in the means test, allows the debtor to claim monthly payments for secured debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.071" offset="10161674">Now, many car loans are probably secured debts and in our view if you actually have a car loan -- now, remember again, he neither has a car loan, nor a car lease payment, nor any kind of ownership payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.861" offset="10204829">But if -- if one actually did have a car loan that was secured by the car, which I think is the vast majority of car loans, in our view the debtor expenses nothing for that under Romanette ii, and only the actual amount of that debt under Romanette iii.</text>

            <text syncTime="2578.913" offset="10421123">But the point at issue in this case doesn't involve the interaction between Romanette ii and Romanette iii, because no matter how those two things interact, when the debtor has no payment whatsoever, he ought not to be able to claim any car ownership costs, because what we are frying to figure out is: What amount does he reasonably need for his maintenance and support?</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.159" offset="10498027">And this question is a very important question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2621.542" offset="10591545">There are many debtors who are getting this expense either above their amount or when they have no such expense at all, and so even if the Court doesn't resolve these other issues that are implicated by this case, the decision here is a simple one, which is: This debtor has no applicable monthly expense amount for transportation ownership costs, and he shouldn't be allowed to expense any amount for that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3344.083" offset="13481733">This is exactly why our view of the law works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.670" offset="13500123">The means test is a minimum amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.439" offset="13511199">It's a bottom line quick figure based on standard deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.223" offset="13530321">It was $200 based on our calculation if he's given his deduction based on age, location, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.794" offset="13556548">We then go back to I and J, and J, which is on page 44 of the Joint Appendix, is his current expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.900" offset="13589044">And if we look at line 13-A, there is no vehicle payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.018" offset="13601479">He is not taking $471.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.387" offset="13610987">He took his income and expense, the bottom line was 500, he knew he had to pay at least 200, he is willing to pay the 500.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.410" offset="13647036">He is not getting a $471 deduction because there is no car payment on his Schedule J.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.914" offset="13673054">And if we look at the formula that way, the means test is a general form to give standard deductions, to give us a quick bottom line, and the debtor is either going to pay that amount or more based on his income and expense, and he would pay more if he really didn't have that expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.626" offset="13743898">So if he didn't have a rent expense of $1,000 a month it would show up on Schedule J that he didn't have 1,000, so his payment would go to $1,500 a month.</text>
