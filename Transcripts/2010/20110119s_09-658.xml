            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">The second case to be announced is Premo versus Moore, Number 09-658.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.723" offset="136296">Moore was found guilty of murder in an Oregon state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.586" offset="151761">And this case calls for determinations that are parallel in some respects to those just discussed in Harrington versus Richter.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.680" offset="184153">Particularly, it involves an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.013" offset="205469">Richter, the case just discussed involved an allegation that the defense counsel in the conduct and preparation of the trial was -- was deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.781" offset="248519">This case concerns Moore's claim that his counsel was deficient during pretrial negotiations that led to a plea agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.035" offset="273596">There was never a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.863" offset="276835">There was a plea agreement of plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.397" offset="295016">Randy Moore kidnapped a man in Oregon and killed him with a single shot to the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.519" offset="311526">He admitted the killing of two people and then confessed to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.552" offset="323647">He said the gun's discharge was accidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.120" offset="333887">He pled no contest to felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.806" offset="344649">And after that, no contest plea, he was found guilty by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.597" offset="359800">He received the 25-year sentence, which was the minimum allowed under Oregon law.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.677" offset="380176">Later, he sought postconviction relief from an Oregon court.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.036" offset="393550">He argued that his attorney was ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.639" offset="403999">He said that his counsel should have moved to suppress the confessions before Moore made the plea agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.448" offset="427196">The Oregon court rejected the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.374" offset="434928">It concluded that suppression would have been fruitless because Moore had also confessed to two other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.481" offset="455304">The District Court denied Moore's subsequent petition for federal habeas corpus but the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.644" offset="479963">The Court of Appeals was wrong to accord scant deference to counsel's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.737" offset="496368">And it was doubly wrong to conclude that it would have been unreasonable for the state court to find that the defense attorney provided effective assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.222" offset="530328">Acknowledging guilt and accepting responsibility by an early plea respond to certain basic premises in the law and its function.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.304" offset="562615">Those principles are eroded if a guilty plea is too easily set aside based on facts and circumstances not apparent to counsel at the time of plea is being considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.404" offset="599082">Plea bargains are the result of complex negotiations, and defense attorneys must make careful strategic choices in balancing the opportunities and the risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.479" offset="631369">The opportunity -- opportunities, of course, include pleading to a lesser charge and obtaining a lesser sentence, as compared with what might be the outcome, not only at trial but from a later plea offer if the case grows stronger and the prosecutors find stiffened resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.040" offset="693541">A risk, in addition to the obvious one of losing the chance for a defense verdict, is that an early plea might come before the prosecution finds its case is getting weaker, not stronger.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.687" offset="732202">The State's case can begin to fall apart as stories change and witnesses become unavailable, and new suspects are identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.433" offset="763131">Moore's counsel could reasonably believe that a swift plea bargain would allow his client to take advantages of the State's aversion to these hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.723" offset="796359">A plea would also eliminate the possibility that one of Moore's accomplices would testify against him in exchange for a better deal for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.535" offset="827601">And delaying the plea for further proceedings would have given the State time to uncover additional incriminating evidence that could have formed the basis of a capital prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.276" offset="866576">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.670" offset="876084">The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.334" offset="890713">Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.538" offset="903565">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
