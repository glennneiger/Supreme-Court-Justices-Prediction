            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">This case concerns the extent of protection that the Petition Clause of the First Amendment grants to public employees when they have a routine dispute with their government employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.607" offset="155836">Petitions are a form of expression.Government employees who invoked the Petition Clause in most cases could also invoke the Speech Clause of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.454" offset="199199">Now in the Speech Clause case, to show that the employer interfered with protected rights, the employee, as a general rule, must show that his or her speech was on a matter of public concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.614" offset="259908">Here, the issue is whether that test applies when the employee invokes the Petition Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.556" offset="283627">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is held but the public concern test does not apply in those instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.554" offset="307660">Charles Guarnieri, the respondent here, filed a union grievance challenging his termination as Chief of Police for the Borough of Duryea, the town of about 4,600 persons in Northeastern Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.986" offset="361368">An arbitrator ordered the respondent reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.418" offset="375056">Upon his return, the counsel issued 11 directives instructing him in the performance of his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.534" offset="399506">For instance, one directive stated that the municipal building is a smoke-free building and that the police department is not exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.410" offset="431062">Respondent filed this lawsuit against the Borough and Borough Counsel and individual members of the counsel under 42 U.S.C. 1983, he claimed that his grievance was a petition protected by the Petition Clause and he alleged that the directives were unlawful retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.507" offset="495428">And after the suit was filed, the counsel denied a request by respondent for overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.950" offset="513191">He amended the complaint to allege that his 1983 lawsuit was a petition and that the denial of overtime also constituted retaliation for his having filed the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.925" offset="553106">The jury found in favor of respondent, defendants appealed on the ground that respondent's grievances and lawsuit did not address matters of public concern, but the Court of Appeals rejected that argument and it affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.354" offset="602843">This Court now concludes that the judgment must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.782" offset="616532">The public concern test developed in Speech Clause cases, reconciles the employee's First Amendment right and the Government employer's legitimate interest in performing this mission.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.269" offset="658536">The Government has a substantial interest in ensuring that all of these operations are efficient and effective, the Government interest that justify a cautious in restraining approach under the Speech Clause or justice relevant under the Petition Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.484" offset="711408">Petitions no less than speech can interfere with the effective and efficient operation of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.965" offset="737322">Adoption of a different rule for Petition Clause claims would provide a ready means for public employees to circumvent the protections of the public concern test.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.462" offset="779222">Now, the Petition Clause undoubtedly does apply in the context of a personal grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.340" offset="798762">Petitions to the Government, nonetheless, assumed an added dimension when they seek to advance political, social or other ideas of interest to the community as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.960" offset="833243">Public employees are members of the community most likely to have informed and definite opinions about a wide range of matters related directly or indirectly to their employment.Just as the public has the right to hear the views of public employees, the public has the right to the benefit of employees for participation in petitioning activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.406" offset="919030">The framework used to govern Speech Clause claims by public employees when applied to the Petition Clause will protect both the interest of the Government and the First Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.372" offset="954870">Because the Court of Appeals did not find it necessary to apply this framework, there has been no determination as to how it would apply in the context of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.376" offset="986948">This Court need not consider that question in the first instance rather the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.373" offset="1026863">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.517" offset="1039506">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment impart and dissenting impart.</text>
