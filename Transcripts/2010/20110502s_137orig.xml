            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">This case comes to us under our original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.934" offset="121145">With Congress's consent, Montana and Wyoming agreed to the Yellowstone River Pact in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.655" offset="156045">Under this Pact, the States agreed that water rights existing in each State as of 1950 would continue to be enjoyed in accordance with the doctrine of appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.797" offset="208603">In 2008, Montana sued Wyoming alleging that it had breached the Compact in several ways by using more than its agreed upon share of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.042" offset="261580">Only one of Montana's allegations is before us today.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.497" offset="283418">The claim that by installing more efficient sprinkler irrigation systems, Wyoming water users have reduced their runoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.216" offset="322288">As a result, less water returns to the river and less water reaches Montana than it did in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.888" offset="364920">Montana claims that Wyoming has therefore violated the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.235" offset="386341">The Special Master reappointed found that Montana's allegations failed to state a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.605" offset="415807">Montana filed an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.800" offset="428659">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we overrule Montana's exception to the Special Master's Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.926" offset="457080">The Yellowstone River Compact preserves water rights “in accordance with the laws governing the acquisition and use of water under the doctrine of appropriation”.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.405" offset="503056">Under that doctrine, efficient sprinkler, irrigation systems are permissible even if they cause a net increase in water consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.825" offset="548718">This is true so long as the sprinkler users do not increase the amount of water they divert from the river or use the conserved water to irrigate new acreage.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.556" offset="599604">Accordingly, Montana's allegations that Wyoming has violated the Compact by merely allowing the installation of more efficient sprinkler systems fails to state a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.072" offset="657701">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.320" offset="670657">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
