            <text syncTime="235.051" offset="1045671">They have that internally from their own claims and data and their relationships with doctors and patients.</text>

            <text syncTime="1231.718" offset="5032270">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.836" offset="5040734">The Vermont statute protects important interests that the Vermont legislature could recognize in physician autonomy and control over information that concerns them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.359" offset="5082843">When a patient brings a prescription to a pharmacy, after that point the patient information is protected under HIPAA and under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.683" offset="5124117">That leaves two primary actors in that transaction -- the physician and the pharmacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.154" offset="5146060">Both are professionals, both are subject to regulation under a comprehensive, closed system for the distribution of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.558" offset="5171660">Prior to the time this statute was enacted, the pharmacy had complete control over the disposition of that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.461" offset="5199245">What this statute does is put the physician, the prescriber, on an equal footing with respect to the pharmacy -- with the pharmacy, with respect to the use of the information about that prescriber, but only with respect to the use of the information in marketing to that prescriber.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.673" offset="5272074">It is a narrowly drawn statute that enables the physician, not the State, enables the physician to determine whether the information that he was required to furnish in connection with the prescribing of a drug will be used in the marketing of products to that -- to that physician.</text>

            <text syncTime="1315.621" offset="5367892">I mean, the pharmacy needs to know who to make the prescription out to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.811" offset="5392656">Federal and State law require a prescription for a prescription drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.263" offset="5406448">But if this was not a prescription drug, a person can go into a drug store and purchase a nonprescription drug just like any other item in a drug store, not have to furnish the name, not have to furnish any of this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.219" offset="5450334">So the information is furnished because of the requirement of a prescription which is of long standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.956" offset="5473217">So this statute is really of a piece with a -- with a number of other types of regulations to protect -- protect privacy, for example, the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, where a person is required to furnish certain information in order to get a driver's license.</text>

            <text syncTime="1896.795" offset="7692581">And the reason we have to look at the statutes and findings in this argument is because the case can't be decided as a matter of absolutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.567" offset="7719643">We know that statutes like HIPAA do protect private information in third parties' hands and they are constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.888" offset="7744930">On the other hand, we also know that a governmental restriction on the use of information could be used to distort the marketplace of ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.208" offset="7778262">So the case is going to have to be decided somewhere in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.458" offset="7787248">And in order to do that, we're going to have to figure out where in the middle Vermont ended up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.195" offset="7806161">Now, in doing that I want to clarify I think three things in the questioning of the first half hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.032" offset="7833537">They are about what the practice are -- practices are at issue here; what this statute does, actually what's the rule; and why is it that Vermont did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.054" offset="7869586">So as to Justice Ginsburg's question, are there other sales, the State gave you the correct answer that the pharmacy companies don't sell to researchers, but that's somewhat misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.345" offset="7910755">They sell to us, and we sell to the researchers, we sell to the government, the intermediaries like IMS Health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.833" offset="7936773">That's because we're the aggregator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.183" offset="7942102">So it is not correct to say that the only sale is for pharmaceutical marketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.987" offset="7961328">Second, on the important question of what this statute--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1966.939" stopTime="1969.422">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="1966.939" offset="7973136">I asked whether there are sales to any other entities.</text>

          <turn speaker="thomas_c_goldstein" startTime="1969.422" stopTime="1980.662">
            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="1969.422" offset="7983062">--Yes, and I said the State gave you the accurate answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.491" offset="7995392">But the implication of the answer I think was not quite correct, because there are sales for purposes other than for marketing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="1980.662" stopTime="1985.900">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="1980.662" offset="8028097">But if this was a general sale provision, then that would include those sales that you're talking about?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_c_goldstein" startTime="1985.900" stopTime="2046.771">

            <text syncTime="1985.900" offset="8048995">It would not, because the point would then -- and I'll come to the statute in a minute, because all the exemptions -- right?</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.387" offset="8070938">So there's -- there's a debate that Justice Alito focused on about what does the statute mean, and I do want to turn to that in a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.624" offset="8095911">But to jump ahead to your question, Justice Kagan, assume that it's a general sale prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.612" offset="8115869">Then there are all the exemptions and the exemptions take all of these other uses out from the sale prohibition: for academic research, to go to the government, and for clinical trials, for health care research.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.669" offset="8164143">Those are all exempted from the general sale prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.454" offset="8175219">So let's do turn, if you don't mind, to what it is the statute actually does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.089" offset="8189743">It is an important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.156" offset="8194027">First, I am going to come to our brief, but I just want to read something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.656" offset="8204058">For your later reference I'm going to have been reading from page 42 of PhRMA's brief, and this is what -- what the State told the Second Circuit, quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.797" offset="8248571">"Data vendors may continue to acquire, edit, and sell this information to whomever they choose so long as that person does not use the information for detailing. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.502" offset="8287441">In turn, the Second Circuit--</text>

            <text syncTime="2052.389" offset="8315026">So, to whomever they choose, so long as that person does not use the information for detailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.959" offset="8337283">The Second Circuit said: Okay, you're the State; here's how we understand the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.661" offset="8352016">The statute only imposed -- quoting again, this is from 22A, it's the language that Justice Alito quoted -- the statute only imposes</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.851" offset="8380855">"restrictions on the sale or use of such data for marketing or promoting a prescription drug. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.536" offset="8399559">So that's what they understood the statute to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.702" offset="8408231">Now, then the question becomes why did they do it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.904" offset="8421083">This was -- Justice Scalia, you tried really hard to get them just to admit, let's just acknowledge what the point is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.142" offset="8445952">And the State tries to deny that the purpose here is to limit the information getting into the hands of the doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.330" offset="8470716">We don't have to rely on the State's lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.213" offset="8478239">The State legislature was very helpful here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.032" offset="8485554">So if we go to the appendix of the IMS brief now, page 1a, okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.769" offset="8512512">Right at the top, the State says their goal is -- this is finding number 1 at the bottom of it -- containing health care costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.590" offset="8539784">Then in finding number 2 they explain why they did it:</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.375" offset="8550964">"There is a strong link between pharmaceutical marketing activities, health care spending and the health of Vermonters. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.629" offset="8571967">Then finding number 3:</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.398" offset="8578968">"The goals of marketing programs are often in conflict with the goals of the State. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.683" offset="8596104">And my favorite, obviously, is number 4:</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.969" offset="8605299">"The marketplace for ideas on medicine safety, the State determined, was operating in conflict with the goals of the State. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.657" offset="8636019">They didn't like the marketplace of ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.207" offset="8642288">Now, it is true, we acknowledge, that another thing the State wanted to do was to give the doctors some more control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.144" offset="8669978">It's in -- it's in -- there is an opt-out option.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.060" offset="8681681">But can I just take you to how the State explained what it was doing?</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.631" offset="8695996">That's just going to be on page 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.998" offset="8701430">Now, the State's lawyer and the Solicitor General have explained to you that they believe that doctors were concerned only with marketing and only with marketing to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.689" offset="8748136">That's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.973" offset="8753361">Finding 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.040" offset="8757541">We have to go all the way to number 29 to get to this goal of the State: 7:</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.227" offset="8786380">"Health care professionals in Vermont who write prescriptions for their patients have a reasonable expectation that the information in that prescription, including their own identity and that of the patient, will not be used for purposes other than the filling and processing of the payment for that prescription. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.904" offset="8844999">It's not just about pharmaceutical marketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.589" offset="8851790">The doctors say -- we all love this; there's stuff about us in our daily lives that we wish was entirely private.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.160" offset="8878017">The doctors here said: Hey, it would be great for us if this information, we had complete control over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.581" offset="8903722">Doctors also would love if medical malpractice judgments weren't broadly known.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.300" offset="8918664">There are all kinds of government records they would prefer not to be out into the public sphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.519" offset="8935487">But then we ask ourselves, all right -- and that's why I asked you to have this brief available -- what did the State do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.240" offset="8958370">Did the State in fact enact a general privacy provision?</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.692" offset="8976238">Is it like HIPAA or instead is all that the State did here target the use for marketing, while it allows the use of the same data for the opposite message by insurers and also by the government?</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.202" offset="9026184">So here's the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.052" offset="9029632">It appears on page 9 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.237" offset="9038409">I want to start with subsection A because the State helpfully reiterates its goals here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.808" offset="9060665">The second half of this paragraph:</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.408" offset="9067039">"The State sought to ensure costs are contained in the private health care sector, as well as for State purchasers of prescription drugs, through the promotion of less costly drugs and ensuring prescribers received unbiased information. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.400" offset="9118971">That's what they're trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.783" offset="9124509">They're trying to say: We would like the drug companies to have a harder time finding the doctors while the insurance companies and the State have an easy time finding the doctors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2674.585" offset="10803764">Any transaction you do could be spread across the world instantaneously, and for the longest time catalogs would sell your name and address to other catalogers, and if you bought one product from one company, you would get a thousand catalogs from 50 million others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.732" offset="10880355">Today the industry is policing that, in part to get the State not to intercede, by giving you an opt-out option.</text>

            <text syncTime="2711.159" offset="10950050">If there is, as I see, some interest that the State legitimately has in protecting that part of the public who says, I entered into this transaction, I didn't really want you to sell my name, I didn't want you to do other things with it, all I did was this transaction, why can't the State say -- there is a difference in my mind between an opt-in and opt-out?</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.348" offset="11086827">Why can't the State say, your desire to enter a transaction in which you're doing just that transaction and not others is something we can protect?</text>

            <text syncTime="2757.905" offset="11137087">And let me explain why it is that that rule -- and let me typify it for you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.523" offset="11151506">There is a pending bill in the Congress called the McCain-Kerry Consumer Protection Act and it does what you're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.427" offset="11179092">It says we're not just going to leave it to the industry; we're going to have a set of governmental rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.498" offset="11195392">Let me distinguish that bill from what goes on under Act 80.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.383" offset="11210961">What that says is that if you are a consumer and you engage in a transaction, you have the right to opt out of any unauthorized uses, because it's just between you and the business, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.591" offset="11255787">So there are three differences between that and this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.877" offset="11264878">The first is the structure of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.110" offset="11273864">That's not what this statute does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.495" offset="11279402">This statute says every use of the information is just fine, except this one, this one that allows one speaker who we don't really like to go out and convey its message.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.284" offset="11318585">The second difference is the public importance of the speech involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.588" offset="11339797">What that consumer information would be used for is to make some random consumer pitch to you or about you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.290" offset="11362576">This is information about lifesaving medications where the detailer goes in and talks about double blind scientific studies that are responsible for the development of drugs that have caused 40 percent of the increase in the lifespan of the American public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.667" offset="11424120">So there's a tremendous difference in the public importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.067" offset="11433733">The third is the fundamentally different nature of the privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.155" offset="11450034">Unlike your consumer transaction over the Internet, this is a doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.523" offset="11467483">You can call up any doctor's office and find out what their prescribing practice is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.177" offset="11486083">It's part of their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.444" offset="11491203">Imagine the following conversation, if you will, and that is, and -- and if you want to look for a place in the common law where this comes from, it would be section 652D of the Restatement, Second, of Torts, what things are private and what aren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.937" offset="11545119">It asks whether a reasonable person would be outraged.</text>

            <text syncTime="3330.475" offset="13427294">So if -- if you still have the IMS brief with you at page 53 this time, so at page 53 the first paragraph is about the State's own use of this information for a variety of purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.735" offset="13488316">There is -- the reply brief for the State introduces a debate about today whether they are using the NPI data for counter-detailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.971" offset="13517260">There is no dispute that they use it for other State programs, like the drug utilization program -- that's the quotes in the first paragraph.</text>

            <text syncTime="3369.433" offset="13583193">So it's not just that the drug -- insurance company says to the doctor, I'll pay for -- $5 for this drug, but the insurance companies take PI data under the exemption in the statute, go to doctors and say we really think this cheaper drug would be better.</text>

            <text syncTime="3727.174" offset="15014076">Okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.642" offset="15015957">And second is going to be why can't the accountant give it away?</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.408" offset="15027033">The first one is LAPD, and it's the same true -- the same thing is true of campaign finance reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.712" offset="15048244">The government has plenary authority; when you give information to the government, what the government then does with the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.133" offset="15073949">The important lesson to be derived from LAPD is that nine members of the Court seemingly agreed -- and I defended the statute in that case -- nine members of the court in that case agreed that if this had been private reports rather than the government's reports, then the statute would have been unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.412" offset="15139046">The reason your tax preparer can't give it away, the reason I can't give away attorney-client secrets, the reason that the government is going to be able to tell Internet companies that they can't give await the consumer information is that it's really private.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.135" offset="15185962">But what if, instead, the government had a rule that says tax preparers can't give out tax information when it will encourage people to protest against their taxes?</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.408" offset="15227026">But if it will encourage people to comply with their taxes, it's perfectly fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.062" offset="15241655">You can't draw lines that are intended to discriminate against speakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.614" offset="15259836">That's the main principle of our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.382" offset="15266941">Thank you very much.</text>

            <label>Ms. Bridget C. Asay</label>
            <text syncTime="3798.520" offset="15299542">I would like to begin with the point that my friend was making about the use of the information by insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.093" offset="15341756">Insurers are not similarly situated to pharmaceutical manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.462" offset="15359310">Insurers receive information directly from doctors and parents in the ordinary course of their business and they use it as part of providing and paying for care to patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.270" offset="15398494">And when my friend described the fact that insurers do that with doctors' information as speaker discrimination, I would like to point out that -- the -- not only the record but the examples, for example, that PhRMA points to on page 126 their brief show that insurers have patient information for that purpose as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.649" offset="15467980">HIPAA allows those uses of both patient and prescriber information to manage benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.218" offset="15490341">So, to argue that pharmaceutical manufacturers are being discriminated against if they don't have access to the same health care information that we provide to our insurance companies would -- would begin to raise serious questions about a statute like HIPAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.610" offset="15539869">And that -- that just highlights that in this area of -- of private information and information control that many of these statutes are structured in such a way that there are expected and intended and permissible uses of information, and other uses for which people are allowed to have control over the further use of their information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.774" offset="15620535">And here we're talking about the control allotted to doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.242" offset="15634432">We place an enormous amount of trust in doctors to make the right treatment decisions for their patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.312" offset="15658674">Part of their ability to make that, those decisions depends on the information that they receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.949" offset="15681243">And what doctors have said to the Vermont legislature and to the Court in this case is that many of them find this practice objectionable and that it is not helpful to them or to their patients to have their information monitored for this marketing purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.828" offset="15752714">And all that they have asked for is the right to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.780" offset="15768492">And I would like to--</text>

            <text syncTime="3916.982" offset="15773299">Ms. Asay, I want to give you the chance to respond to a point that was highlighted by your friend, which is the fourth legislative finding, which does seem to say that the State is doing this because it doesn't like an imbalance in the marketplace of ideas.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="3929.789" offset="15824603">--Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.756" offset="15828470">The findings, first of all, have to be taken as they were adopted, which was in support of not this statute even as it was written, but as a much larger bill that contained many sections, including a provision that created the evidence based education program which is a -- a clinical -- a -- a program to provide voluntary education to doctors, and to the statute as it used to be written, which -- which not only had this provision for the doctors' choice and the use of the information, but also mandated that pharmaceutical detailers provide information affirmatively as part of the marketing process.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3964.130" offset="15961903">Do we have -- were there -- were there findings with respect to the statute as enacted?</text>

            <label>Ms. Bridget C. Asay</label>
            <text syncTime="3967.831" offset="15976741">There are no findings that accompany the amendment that resulted in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.283" offset="15994504">And to -- to return to, I think Justice Kennedy's point from earlier, the statute, I think, has to stand or fall on the restriction that it -- that it allows for doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.876" offset="16048943">The Court, for example, in O'Brien discussed the fact that striking down a statute because the court disagreed with the record would -- would simply mean that the legislature could adopt the same statute again on a different record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.386" offset="16106935">We would say here that what -- what's -- the question before the Court really is, may doctors have this opportunity to control the use of their information about -- their nonpublic information about their prescribing practices as a marketing tool or not, and that -- that -- that should be the -- the focus of the Court's inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.899" offset="16193034">I would also like to just return to the point that -- that I believe I was making earlier that this statute is so different from the cases in which the Court has considered restrictions on the direct commercial advertising and the provision of information to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.963" offset="16269312">This is an entirely nonpublic commercial transmission of data.</text>
            <text syncTime="4046.248" offset="16290419">It -- it starts with a private commercial transaction, it's a private commercial exchange between the data vendors and the pharmacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.270" offset="16322497">It's used in a way that it is never disclosed publicly, never included in the advertising message.</text>
            <text syncTime="4059.757" offset="16344440">There's no restriction here on the information that's provided to doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.495" offset="16363353">The truthful information that the FDA permits to be provided about prescription drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.713" offset="16384251">And there's no restriction on any exchange between a willing listener and a willing speaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.101" offset="16405776">I believe my friend suggested that -- that anyone could call a doctor's office and find out by asking what the doctor prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.921" offset="16433152">Pharmaceutical manufacturers can do that as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.040" offset="16441616">And if the doctor volunteers that information, there can be that exchange of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4089.543" offset="16463559">The statute does not restrict it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4090.827" offset="16468679">I take it there's -- there's -- it's against the law for a physician to say I want you to fill this prescription in a particular place, a particular pharmacy because I know that pharmacy doesn't sell the information.</text>
