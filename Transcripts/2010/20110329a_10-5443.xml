            <text syncTime="144.524" offset="683510">The defendant must intend to prevent the communication of information about a Federal offense or a possible Federal offense to a law enforcement officer who happens to be a Federal law enforcement officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.588" offset="871800">We would agree with you that the law does require that the defendant intend to prevent a communication.</text>

            <text syncTime="209.134" offset="941913">Going -- going back to Justice Alito's question: Obviously, the statute's not written to say the intent to preclude a witness from talking to law enforcement officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.493" offset="1007428">If it were that simple about a Federal crime, then it wouldn't matter whether it was likely, possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="1466.876" offset="5972888">Two men are sitting on a park bench planning the commission of a Federal crime, hijacking of an airplane, and they think they're by themselves; so they're talking about this, and then after they've had a discussion they turn around and they see there's somebody standing very close by; and so they say we have to kill this person to prevent him from going to the FBI, and so they do, and they're prosecuted under this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1526.116" offset="6209870">What subsection (g)(2) tells us is that you don't need to prove a Federal officer's specific intent for every violation of the statute, but if you can prove that, then that's enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.639" offset="6248009">And so in this case there's no evidence that the Petitioner had a specific intent as to a Federal officer, but, for example, if Officer Horner had said, hey, I'm the FBI or hey, I'm calling the FBI right now, and then he had killed him, that would have been enough whether it were true or not.</text>
