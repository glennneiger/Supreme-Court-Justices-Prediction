            <label>Mr. Neal Kumar Katyal</label>
            <text syncTime="8.604" offset="139849">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.039" offset="149567">This lawsuit seeks personal money damages against a former Attorney General of the United States for doing his job, allegedly with an improper motive, yet the Attorney General, like the Federal prosecutor in Idaho who sought the material witness warrant at issue in this case, was performing the functions of his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.983" offset="221351">There are three reasons why the Petitioner should not be personally liable for money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.654" offset="240055">The first is because the prosecutor's act of seeking the material witness warrant is integrally associated with the judicial process and entitled to absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.260" offset="278507">To view it any other way is to expose both line prosecutors and high officials to lawsuits by highly incentivized litigants based on their purportedly bad motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.385" offset="318945">That is something this Court has manifestly resisted and for good reason, because improper motives are easy to allege and hard to disprove.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.222" offset="350292">Allowing such suits to proceed would result in burdensome litigation and interfere with the ability of prosecutors to do their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.494" offset="379444">The second reason is that the Fourth Amendment was not violated, and, therefore, qualified immunity applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.214" offset="402328">There can be little doubt that the statutory requirements of section 3144 were met in this case, and, equally, there can be little doubt that the subjective motivations of Attorney General Ashcroft or the line prosecutor are thoroughly irrelevant to whether a Fourth Amendment violation exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.991" offset="469410">This Court has repeatedly rejected subjectivity, explaining that otherwise time-consuming, vexatious, burdensome, and, indeed, destabilizing discovery and litigation would be the inexorable result.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.532" offset="515594">And the third reason, and the easiest reason, is that whatever one thinks the applicable law is, what it -- it was manifestly not the law in 2003 when the warrant in this case was issued by a neutral judge in Idaho.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="114.506" offset="563451">Can I ask whether your second reason doesn't boil down to saying that it makes very little difference whether -- whether Ashcroft is -- is held immune by absolute immunity or by qualified immunity?</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="136.722" offset="652267">Once -- once you say that -- that motive is not introducible with regard to the qualified immunity question, and once you say that he's using a witness subpoena, and you can't look behind it as to whether he was abusing it for some other purpose, is there any difference between absolute and qualified immunity?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neal_kumar_katyal" startTime="155.350" stopTime="196.456">
            <label>Mr. Neal Kumar Katyal</label>
            <text syncTime="155.350" offset="726768">--Well, I take it there may be a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.933" offset="733142">We think the Court should first decide the absolute immunity question, which is the way that this Court has historically handled questions when there's an absolute immunity question and then a qualified immunity one.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.039" offset="769609">I take it that the qualified immunity question in this case is one about whether motivations matter for the Fourth Amendment; whereas the motivation question in the absolute immunity sense, as Respondents see it, is -- is something broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.197" offset="822168">It's not limited to the Fourth Amendment, per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.130" offset="829900">Their argument is if the prosecutor is -- has bad motives essentially or a certain bad motive, an investigatory or purposeful bad motive to engage in preventive detention, that somehow pierces the veil of absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.687" offset="880159">That is something this Court has never accepted.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="196.456" stopTime="233.597">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="196.456" offset="891235">Well, I thought the -- I thought the argument, rather, was that this is not as close to the core of the prosecutorial function as some of the other functions to which we have given absolute immunity, and since it's so dangerous, since there is such potential for abuse, we shouldn't confer absolute immunity on this particular conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.726" offset="1008368">But I don't understand why if we agree with you on qualified immunity, there is any difference whatever.</text>

          <turn speaker="neal_kumar_katyal" startTime="233.597" stopTime="240.918">
            <label>Mr. Neal Kumar Katyal</label>
            <text syncTime="233.597" offset="1039820">Justice Scalia, to be sure, they are now making that argument in this Court, that this doesn't fall -- this isn't intimately associated--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="240.918" stopTime="241.353">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="240.918" offset="1069077">Right.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.353" offset="1070853">--with the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.003" offset="1073465">Below, of course, they said the reverse: That material witness warrants were associated with the judicial process and that the only difference is that -- that, here, they had a bad motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.143" offset="1114008">So I've talked about the bad motive point.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.661" offset="1124039">Now, with respect to whether this is intimately associated with the judicial process, these are material witness warrants being sought in connection with an ongoing investigation by a prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.486" offset="1171372">It is quintessentially a prosecutorial function to obtain these warrants and has been for -- for hundreds of years, and it's the exercise of the prosecutor's professional judgment, which is something that this Court has looked to.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.299" offset="1250576">Yes, it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.516" offset="1251516">The indictment of Mr. Al-Hussayen was in February 2003.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.584" offset="1263741">The prosecutors learned in March that Mr. Al-Kidd was about to board a plane and go off to Saudi Arabia for an unspecified length of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.024" offset="1297492">They then acted immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.674" offset="1304074">They went to the court and said we need this warrant to secure this testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.428" offset="1323092">That is, to me, essentially what prosecutors do and protected by Imbler.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.145" offset="1342004">To see it any other way is to expose prosecutors to lawsuits for--</text>

            <label>Mr. Neal Kumar Katyal</label>
            <text syncTime="349.187" offset="1502187">--He had travel restrictions placed upon him until the trial was over and until the government -- because after the resolution of Mr. Al-Hussayen's case, which was acquittal on some charges and a hung conviction -- a hung -- a hung decision on others, the government thought about retrying Mr. Al-Hussayen, took it very seriously, and 20 days after al-Hussayen's verdict by the jury, we reached an agreement with them in writing that Mr. Al-Hussayen would leave the country and -- and not come back, and in exchange we weren't going to prosecute him any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.592" offset="1635830">And so, immediately -- I think quite soon after the jury verdict, the -- the conditions placed on Mr. Al-Kidd were lifted.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.114" offset="1669893">And I should say that the material witness warrant statute laces into it a whole suite of safeguards to prevent against -- as, Justice Scalia, you pointed out -- the potential abuse for the -- for material witnesses by prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.523" offset="1723496">I think Congress has set up several different things to prevent that.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.909" offset="1737080">The first is, in order to get a material witness warrant, the prosecutor needs to show both materiality and then practicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.998" offset="1769368">The second is that there are strict limits placed on the conditions of the -- on the ability of the prosecutor to detain anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.419" offset="1799147">Section 3142 says that a detention can only be allowed by a judge if, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="428.823" offset="1820672">"no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the individual. "</text>
            <text syncTime="436.079" offset="1849720">And then there's a formal procedure where they have a right to counsel, they have the right to cross-examine witnesses, to -- to present evidence, to proffer evidence at the hearing, and the like -- all to show that they shouldn't continue to be detained.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="451.088" offset="1909802">Well, in light of these restrictions, I would like to come back to the question that I understood Justice Scalia to be asking.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.325" offset="1934670">If the Court were to hold that obtaining a material witness warrant does not violate the Fourth Amendment where the statutory requirements, and in particular establishing materiality, are met, why would it be necessary for the Court to decide whether there's absolute immunity when a prosecutor seeks a material witness warrant?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neal_kumar_katyal" startTime="478.405" stopTime="556.005">
            <label>Mr. Neal Kumar Katyal</label>
            <text syncTime="478.405" offset="2018994">For two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.239" offset="2022337">Number one is I think that's the way this Court has historically gone about it, probably for reasons of constitutional avoidance, to not reach constitutional questions if there's an absolute immunity question.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.212" offset="2066223">And the second is, here, you have a Ninth Circuit decision, Justice Alito, that says that -- that absolute immunity can be pierced by a prosecutor's bad motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.585" offset="2107810">That is something that infects not simply material witness warrant cases but, indeed, virtually any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.972" offset="2129335">As we point out and as the dissent below pointed out, that kind of argument could be run by any defendant who says you didn't intend to actually indict me, or, you didn't care about that, you really wanted to flip me to get testimony against some higher-up.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.316" offset="2190670">And to allow defendants to make those kinds of arguments and to expose line prosecutors and attorneys general to that form of liability is an extremely damaging proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.806" offset="2240616">The -- with respect to the Fourth Amendment question about whether or not motive applies, I think this Court has quite clearly said in Whren that motive is not -- is not something that should be looked to, that the subjective motivations of the prosecutor are not -- are--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="556.005" stopTime="585.590">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="556.005" offset="2329433">But that's after there is probable cause to suspect that criminal activity has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.309" offset="2354615">And then you -- once you have probable cause, they're not going to look behind probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.712" offset="2376244">But, here, the whole reason for using this material witness statute is that there isn't probable cause to believe that al-Kidd did anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.853" offset="2424832">The violation -- there was no violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.555" offset="2435594">So Whren is different.</text>

            <text syncTime="585.590" offset="2447820">--Justice Ginsburg, it's certainly different in -- in that respect, but I do think that difference doesn't matter, because I think what Whren and Edmond and the cases were getting at is, is there some objective, individualized determination by a neutral judge?</text>
            <text syncTime="601.116" offset="2509887">And, here, as I was saying earlier, there is quite clearly that laced into the 3144 statute itself; that is, the judge must find materiality and -- and impracticability of the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.276" offset="2566520">And that is a standard performing, I think, a long-standing government function of making sure that testimony, important testimony, is available at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.799" offset="2604659">So it is not like a situation in which the government, just on their mere say-so, can put the -- can detain someone on the basis of them saying, well, we think this person has information.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.439" offset="2651157">I think there are strict standards placed on that, and, indeed, Federal Rule -- Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 46 adds standards to it by saying that a prosecutor must report to the judge every 10 days about anyone who is detained and assure no more detention is necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.848" offset="5000819">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.633" offset="5011999">In Dunaway, this Court emphatically reaffirmed the bedrock Fourth Amendment principle that a criminal suspect may not be arrested, absent probable cause to believe there has been a law violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.524" offset="5059542">The rule is fundamental to our traditions, is widely viewed as a defining feature of our country, and has been steadfastly protected by this Court for more than 2 centuries in both good and bad times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.248" offset="5110429">The material witness statute represents a dramatic departure to the rule, allowing the arrest of uncharged, innocent, even cooperative people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.771" offset="5144492">If a material witness arrest is constitutional, it can only be because its purpose is to secure testimony and not to preventively detain and investigate the witness himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1271.345" offset="5190781">Do you acknowledge that it is then constitutional?</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.214" offset="5202275">Your -- your opening comments make me think you don't even acknowledge that it's constitutional then?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lee Gelernt</label>
            <text syncTime="1279.518" offset="5223487">Justice Scalia, we are not pressing that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.551" offset="5231637">I would say that based on the legal historian's brief there is a strong argument to be made that it is not constitutional, with respect at least to cooperative witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.037" offset="5265596">The statute the Framers enacted in 1789 would not allow the arrest of any witness unless they came voluntarily before the magistrate and refused to even promise to return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.362" offset="5310840">Not even a surety or a -- a surety or a bond was allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.814" offset="5324633">So we do think there is a strong argument, but we are not pressing that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.201" offset="5338216">Our argument is that it cannot be used for ulterior purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.503" offset="5355457">And I just want to pick up, if I can, with Justice Breyer's hypothetical that he posed to the government, which is of course our hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.307" offset="5382625">The government started out this case throughout the lower courts and in the opening brief saying purpose is wholly irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.995" offset="5413449">This is Whren, even though Whren is probable cause to believe a law has been violated; this is Whren, purpose is wholly irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.899" offset="5441034">We posed a hypothetical which we actually think is this case and is consistent with our factual allegations, that the sole reason this arrest was made was not to secure testimony but to preventively detain and investigate someone for whom there was no probable cause or violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.211" offset="5514282">That is -- is a difficult situation I think to reconcile with Whren, I think an impossible situation to reconcile with Whren, or with the text or history of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.752" offset="5552421">The government has now come back and trying to have it both ways and saying, well, the statute wouldn't naturally allow that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.905" offset="5577080">But if purpose is -- as Justice Breyer pointed out, if purpose is truly irrelevant why they want to make the arrest, the government should have answered</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.993" offset="5609368">"that would be fine. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.628" offset="5615950">"The only things we need to satisfy are the objective components of materiality and impracticability. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1383.999" offset="5641446">Is this a -- is this a realistic hypothetical that you've posed?</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.217" offset="5654298">Now, in order to detain someone under the material witness statute, that person, potential witness, must have material testimony, not just relevant testimony, material testimony, testimony that would be of some importance in the criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.829" offset="5720754">So your hypothetical is a situation in which there is a witness and this witness has important testimony that could be used in a pending criminal case, and yet the prosecution has absolutely no interest in calling that person as a witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1421.354" offset="5790866">Well, Justice Alito, I -- I think a few points, one is just as an initial matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.258" offset="5810406">The statute has not actually been interpreted to go beyond relevance, in the way you're posing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.995" offset="5833394">Interestingly, earlier statutes actually said the testimony needed to be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.281" offset="5850530">And so, that's -- that's actually an important watering down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.749" offset="5860456">But putting that aside for the moment, we think that what -- it -- it did happen in this case, it happened after 9-11, I think that goes to the crux of our case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.688" offset="5896192">We are not trying to fiddle with the use of the material witness statute in the every day context, and I think that's the point the Federal prosecutor's brief is making.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.793" offset="5932554">What we are saying is simply that the principle has to be that if you do encounter that extreme case, this Court should not bless the situation where it literally can be used as a preventive--</text>

            <text syncTime="1468.082" offset="5977799">The problem, and it's, I think, the problem that I think Whren highlighted is that the -- the allegation can so readily be made in every case under the material witness statute is that this is one of those bad intent cases, and the case has to proceed so that we can prove that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.278" offset="6038507">One of the ways we prove that is by asking everybody who is involved in the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.313" offset="6054703">Why did you do this?</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.480" offset="6059301">What was your intent?</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.181" offset="6062122">I mean, the whole purpose of Whren is to make sure that kind of stuff doesn't happen.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lee Gelernt</label>
            <text syncTime="1492.799" offset="6076646">--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but let me -- let me say that I think I -- as I understand Whren, I obviously don't want to tell the Court about its own cases, but is that it was drawing a conceptual line, that the first point about Whren, and I think the fundamental point, was the conceptual point that as the Whren court put it, only an undiscerning reader would conflate cases in which there was probable cause of a violation of the law with cases in which there wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.415" offset="6171105">So I think the Whren court is not saying we wouldn't look at purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.534" offset="6187510">I think that's the teaching of the special needs cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.617" offset="6195869">Now, to your practical question about why would this be hard to allege?</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.985" offset="6209348">I actually think that this is one of those unique situations which it would be very difficult to allege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.937" offset="6229201">Take the government's cases, for example, that they've cited, like Daniels and Betts, the material witness cases, you have witnesses being arrested, not showing up for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.594" offset="6267758">As the court of appeals made clear in those cases, they were the main witnesses, not showing up on the day of the trial or right before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.998" offset="6297433">It would be virtually impossible for those witnesses to turn around and say the only reason I was arrested was for investigative purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.687" offset="6332123">And I think that on top of the fact that this statute is used very rarely, I mean what we have pointed out is other than in immigration cases, which the person is already subject to custody, there are only a few hundred each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.262" offset="6378517">And again, I think what the Green brief is saying by the Federal prosecutors is, look, the settled understanding of this statute among line prosecutors has always been, you use it to secure testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.050" offset="6421671">Maybe there's a windfall in the back of your mind that this person might be a suspect, but you certainly can't use it where you have no intention of using the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.056" offset="6453645">I think then the limitations on this statute become meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.758" offset="6468483">I mean, take--</text>

            <text syncTime="1591.608" offset="6471826">So every time the prosecutor elects not to call one of these witnesses for a variety of reasons, you would have a claim that this wasn't designed to elicit testimony?</text>

            <text syncTime="1602.583" offset="6515712">--No, no, we don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.435" offset="6523131">I -- I think what we have -- we have said is that calling the witness or not calling the witness can't be determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.589" offset="6543820">I think one reason is you wouldn't want to create a perverse incentive to have prosecutors simply call the witness just to cover themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.993" offset="6569420">So I think you would have to allege much more, and I think that's what we have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.527" offset="6583526">I think there is an entire set of allegations with respect to Mr. Al-Kidd, and they fit a national pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.431" offset="6607141">And I would importantly say in the questions presented, the government raised an Iqbal claim as to plausibility only as to a small part of this case which is no longer part of the case, which is, was Mr. Ashcroft involved in the specific statements in this specific affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.191" offset="6670148">They did not allege that the allegations of a pretextual policy were implausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.762" offset="6692509">So it is not before this court, it is not a question presented, and I think it is telling that the government didn't raise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.832" offset="6712780">They are sitting on all the information about what happened after 9-11 as a policy matter, and they did not claim it was implausible.</text>

            <text syncTime="1666.675" offset="6772130">I thought there were 4,000 material witness hearings a year.</text>

            <text syncTime="1674.345" offset="6802850">That what the -- what the court of appeals showed and what the statistics also show is that roughly 92 percent of the cases are immigration cases, where the person is already subject to custody, and there wouldn't be any need to use it in that pretextual way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.070" offset="6853736">So what we're talking about is a few hundred each year throughout the country, and again when it's used properly, it's going to be virtually impossible to allege something like this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1709.352" offset="6942866">What we do know about the States, though is that more than 30 of the States have statutes that are much more restrictive than the Federal Government, because what they do is they follow what the framers did in 1789, which is to say the witness has to be given an opportunity to comply, and that's what the framers did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.064" offset="7013710">You have to ask the witness if they will continue to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.564" offset="7023637">If they won't -- or you have to make a showing of why it's impossible to ask them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.182" offset="7038161">So, I think in many States it won't be a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.599" offset="7047774">I think actually, you know, the State issue is an important one because what the Federal Government is arguing here is, of course, well, our prosecutors are very well supervised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.038" offset="7085599">Well, that -- that doesn't take into account if there is a deliberate attempt to misuse it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.692" offset="7100228">But I also think what we're looking at are States, local counties, cities where there may not be the resources necessary to put checks on, and what the government's asking is for this Court to hold that as long as you can make the minimal showings of impracticability and materiality, which don't even require the evidence to be important or that the witness be uncooperative, you then can have any purpose you want.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.224" offset="7194269">So you could have States, cities, local counties saying every member of this gang or every member of this business must know some information about the person that's been indicted.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lee Gelernt</label>
            <text syncTime="2505.119" offset="10125939">Your Honor, I think that the clearest allegations are at 111 and 112 and 154 of our complaint, in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.176" offset="10174109">What we said is it was not to secure testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.895" offset="10189051">And I think the Ninth Circuit certainly understood it that way at pages -- I apologize -- 25A and 40A of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.520" offset="10227503">And the government, in its cert petition and its brief, understood it that way in saying, we don't know how the Ninth Circuit would deal with a mixed motive case, clearly suggesting that the Ninth Circuit was a sole motive case; and so again, all we are saying is it cannot be that this statute be transformed into a preventive detention statute, and I think particularly so because the government after 9-11 specifically -- as the green brief notes -- specifically asked Congress for preventive detention power, and that power was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.007" offset="10361459">What they granted was a very limited 7-day hold only for noncitizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.561" offset="10379640">And so I think what we're talking about in many respects -- at a macro level is a separation of powers case as much as a Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.549" offset="10411614">I think it's not -- it's not dissimilar to the dialogue this Court has been having in the Guantanamo cases with, look, you need to go beyond the Fourth Amendment; if you think you need such a fundamental change to our country's traditions, Congress is going to have to take the first step, we'll look at it and there will be a back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.010" offset="10481413">But here what happened was the preventive detention powers were denied and yet the government still went ahead and used the material witness statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.132" offset="10517985">And again, I can't stress enough that the government did not raise an Iqbal claim as to the plausibility of these allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.655" offset="10548078">Only now in the reply brief where they're -- they're trying to address a sole motive situation, or a but-for, which is all we're asking this Court to address, the government has now said the allegations are implausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.196" offset="10598233">I think that in many situations -- you know, with the absolute immunity point, if I could just turn to that for a second -- the history, as you said, Justice Kennedy, the government has conceded they don't have a case on their side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.907" offset="10665002">We have plenty of cases in which, as the historians' brief points out, and as our brief points out, in which there was not immunity for the arrest of a -- for the arrest of a witness, which is very different than calling a witness, Justice Sotomayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.549" offset="10719650">And what we are talking about here also is the government's burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.167" offset="10734070">So I don't think that's something we could have -- we could have waived, especially since the Ninth Circuit addressed it and put the government on notice that the government came forward with no historical evidence; and it's not inconsistent with warrants generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.825" offset="10788718">As this Court made clear in Malley, it surveyed the history of arrest warrants and said, look, arrest warrants, there's no history; we're not going to grant absolute immunity for arrest warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.632" offset="10831976">In Burns, Justice Scalia pointed out that there is no history with respect to search warrants, and I think the history with respect to material witness warrants is even clearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.905" offset="10869070">So what we're talking about is no history; we're talking about a fairly ancillary and rarely used process to the criminal justice system, and one we're talking about where there's sort of a unique confluence of factors where you have someone who is not the defendant in the trial, who is a third party, and their liberty is being deprived; and it's the type of statute that can be abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.271" offset="10958514">I mean, I think the government's whole point is it's a dual -- it's a dual motive type statute; and so that because it can be inherently abused, there has to be some checks on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.276" offset="10994563">And this Court has never said that you would have absolute immunity for all prosecutors in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.530" offset="11019536">We are certainly not raising a motive case with respect to absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.165" offset="11038030">What we are simply applying is the Court's test in absolute immunity, which is the functional approach, you have to make that threshold determination about whether something is investigative or not; and I think that's the teaching of Buckley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.206" offset="11086200">Take two witness interviews.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.925" offset="11093096">They're the same act, but the prosecutor clearly can be engaged in interviews for different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.328" offset="11118696">In Buckley, it happened to be on those facts the Court believed it was investigative, based on the allegations in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.049" offset="11141580">But what if it were 2 days before the presentment to the grand jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.334" offset="11154745">It's likely the prosecutor would have assumed he had probable cause at that point and was prepping the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.571" offset="11175748">Those are two acts, but you have to look behind them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.107" offset="11189854">I think there's no way around looking behind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.825" offset="11200721">The alternative, the flip side of what the government's asking, is: rigidly categorize every single act a prosecutor may undertake in this country and say it's either wholly investigatory or wholly prosecutorial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.735" offset="11260385">And I think that's a very difficult test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.686" offset="11268117">I think there's no reason why district courts can't make an initial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.805" offset="11284626">I think here in particular, Judge -- was in a unique position to make the determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.274" offset="11302494">He sat at the underlying trial of Al-Hussayen, so he knew what testimony and what was going on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2882.178" offset="11634145">I can understand it with respect to 1983, on the theory that when Congress passed the predecessor of that statute it implicitly intended to adopt the immunities that were available at the time; but when this Court invented the Bivens claim -- in when -- 1971 or whatever -- that the Court -- the Court was -- committed itself to recognizing only those immunities that were available at the time when 1983 was adopted?</text>

            <text syncTime="2912.864" offset="11756920">I think, you know, part of what the Court's answer is, it's a practical concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.082" offset="11773743">That it's just too difficult to have different immunities, and the Court -- so the Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that, and I think from a policy standpoint, a practical standpoint, it's felt that that's the right analysis, and there has to be some way to tether the immunity analysis; and history is ultimately, I think -- what the Court has said it's a necessary though not sufficient, and that once you sort of unmoor it from history, it becomes very difficult to keep the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.150" offset="11874053">So I think what we're talking about here is a -- a statute that has enormous consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.871" offset="11900907">It's third parties who have been cooperative, even, who have done nothing wrong, that end up in jail, and to say that there is going to be absolute immunity is very dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.559" offset="11943643">This Court has repeatedly said that the thumb has to be on the scale against absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.130" offset="11965900">That's an extraordinary protection, and if there's anywhere where there needs to not be complete insulation, it would be where you have third parties, and -- who are going to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.319" offset="12006651">The only other case, prosecutorial immunity case this Court has had where it was a third party and not the actual defendant was Mitchell, and the Court denied absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.794" offset="12044581">All the other cases, some of which you have denied absolute immunity, some of which you have granted, it's been the defendant in the full judicial process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2997.518" offset="12095467">I think the allegations are very clear that it's at least but-for -- we think sole -- but certainly far more than dual motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.290" offset="12126605">People were held -- half the people were held more than 30 days, even though the statutory presumption is 10 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="3035.123" offset="12245932">It's not about Guantanamo, it's not about separation of powers, it's about one simple thing: should we allow damages actions against an Attorney General of the United States and ultimately AUSAs for doing their job, when they're alleged to have a bad motive?</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.715" offset="12304238">If I could start with the Chief Justice's point about the cost of these lawsuits and allowing them to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.953" offset="12329211">My friend on the other side says, well, but this will be a small, rare case, an isolated example, but I don't think that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.290" offset="12358572">I think if you allow their motivation argument to -- to -- to pierce absolute immunity, you will have this in every case or near every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.729" offset="12392323">95 to 96 percent of Federal cases are resolved by plea agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.117" offset="12413848">So there isn't someone who is actually called at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.984" offset="12425341">You could allege it in any of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.936" offset="12437149">And particularly when you lace on to that what my friend has said is a disturbing, quote, "national pattern of abuse" of the material witness statute, something which we -- with which we vigorously disagree, but if you could add the fact that someone wasn't called on in a trial to that national pattern, then you'll be having these damages actions quite a bit of the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3108.754" offset="12540385">Well, leaving apart the fact that that excludes immigration cases and excludes the States' cases, as Justice Kennedy said, a few hundred lawsuits just at the Federal level filed against the Attorney General?</text>

            <text syncTime="3222.394" offset="12995020">Now here it says that the person filling out the affidavit has to say he is a material witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.200" offset="13030233">So suppose that the plaintiffs were to prove that the individual who signed that was not telling the truth in saying he is a material instant -- witness because not just but for, but there was no possibility he would call this individual, none.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.363" offset="13114870">And that's what they have to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.482" offset="13123333">It's really very hard burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.517" offset="13131483">Now, one, would that interfere significantly with law enforcement?</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.552" offset="13147679">And, two, how do you distinguish it from the drug case?</text>

            <text syncTime="3271.277" offset="13190520">If it is the agent, I don't think that is something as to which absolute immunity adheres, that's Malley v. Briggs and a whole line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.264" offset="13222494">Qualified immunity, of course, would, and indeed those claims are pending in this--</text>

            <text syncTime="3283.966" offset="13241302">But in the case of the agent, you're prepared to say that we will allow the plaintiff to go into his motive to the extent that the plaintiff can show there is no possibility he intended to call this individual?</text>

            <text syncTime="3297.475" offset="13295323">--I think that at least for purposes -- I would say there is at least no absolute immunity prohibition against that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.295" offset="13318625">There may be -- may be relevant under other lines of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.663" offset="13332104">But with respect to my friend's point about your hypothetical in which he said that there -- you know, the government isn't sticking to its position or something like that, I just want to be clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.603" offset="13371810">Our position is for the Fourth Amendment, it doesn't look to subjective motivations at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.007" offset="13393439">That's Whren and Brigham City and the like, but the statute in 3144 does have safeguards, prophylactic safeguards to guard against the type of abuse that I think several justices have mentioned today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.497" offset="13447356">So that you could only detain someone so long as their release wouldn't result in a failure of justice and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.936" offset="13477136">My friend also said that -- that there's no historical precedent for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.007" offset="13501482">I would urge the Court to look at the 1846 statute, which didn't require failure to comply before a witness was brought in on a material witness warrant and it didn't -- and it had sureties in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.465" offset="13547248">I don't think what the government is doing here is any different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.417" offset="13559056">Maybe I'll just make one final point, picking up on what Justice Alito said about the allegations in this very case, because I don't think if you look at the complaint that the allegations in this case prove either that the Attorney General or the line AUSA had a single motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.461" offset="13627288">This is fleshed out at pages 17 to 19 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.829" offset="13640767">At best, they're consistent with their newly minted standard, a dual motive standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.400" offset="13663023">And given that, I think that the complaint would fall on their own terms, and indeed that law -- that line that they're proposing, a but-for causation line, would be extremely difficult to apply in practice and would ultimately lead to lawsuits filed against attorneys general and line prosecutors alike.</text>
