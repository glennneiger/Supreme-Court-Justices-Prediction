            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">This case concerns California's time limitation on applications for postconviction relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.926" offset="153119">The question presented: â€œDoes California's requirement that habeas corpus petitions be filed as promptly as possible qualify as an independent State ground for denying relief adequate to bar a subsequent application for the same relief in federal court?</text>
            <text syncTime="34.332" offset="242772">Unlike most states, California does not employ fixed statutory deadlines to determine the timeliness of a state prisoner's petition for habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.954" offset="293240">Instead, California directs petitioners to file known claims without substantial delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.931" offset="321139">Petitioners are further instructed to state when they first learned of the claims they are asserting and to explain why they did not advance those claims sooner.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.404" offset="371085">Claims not presented as promptly as the circumstances allow may be denied as untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.010" offset="405462">California courts signal that a habeas petition is denied as time barred by citing the California Supreme Court's controlling decisions, In re Clark and In re Robbins.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.990" offset="461364">But denial of a petition for undue delay is a may, not a must.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.341" offset="486755">A California court has discretion to pass over the question whether a petition was filed too late and simply deny the petition for want of merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.601" offset="531790">Petitioner below, respondent here, Charles W. Martin presented claims for postconviction relief, allegations that his counsel had provided ineffective assistance in a habeas petition filed in the California Supreme Court, nearly five years after his conviction became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.050" offset="617576">Habeas petitioners in California can file directly in the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.289" offset="642550">They need not climb up the judicial ladder to get there.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.215" offset="658328">Martin gave no reason for the long delay in asserting the ineffective assistance claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.066" offset="685704">Citing Clark and Robbins, the court denied Martin's petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.565" offset="703676">In turn, the Federal District Court dismissed Martin's Federal habeas petition raising the same claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.433" offset="735128">Denial of Martin's state court petition as untimely the District Court held rested on an adequate and independent state procedural ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.204" offset="778282">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.Contrasting the precision -- precision of fixed statutory deadlines, for example one year but California's no substantial delay formulation a Federal Appeals Court held that California's standard lacked the clarity and certainty necessary to constitute an adequate state bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.222" offset="882354">We reversed that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.302" offset="894579">In a 2009 decision, Beard -- Beard against Kindler, this Court clarified that a state procedural bar may qualify as an adequate and independent state ground for denying a federal habeas petition even if the state court had discretion to omit ruling on the procedural barrier and instead ruled on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.422" offset="999069">Guided by that decision, we hold that California is not put to the choice of imposing a specific deadline for habeas petitions which would almost certainly rule out Martin's nearly five-year delay or preserving the flexibility of it's current practice but at a considerable price, opening the door to federal habeas review and thereby undermining the finality of state court judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.062" offset="1109619">In ruling for California, we stress that Martin has not alleged that the state's time bar, either by design or in operation, discriminates against federal claims or claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.423" offset="1163118">The opinion of the court is unanimous.</text>
