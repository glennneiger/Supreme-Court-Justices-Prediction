            <text syncTime="141.740">Because he didn't have the opportunity to challenge that decision, the Fourth Amendment decision; therefore, it would have no preclusive effect on him.</text>

            <text syncTime="298.359">Because in this case, we have a plaintiff who is not going to be confronted with this situation again and who has put herself out of the running for damages because she didn't -- she didn't challenge the qualified immunity ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.439">So she has no stake in any monetary relief from this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.259">She has no continuing -- the -- what has happened to her, happened to her at age 9, will never happen again now that she's past 18.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.607">It just seems like the whole case has evaporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.993">She has no claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.026">She did have a claim for -- for money damages, but she has relinquished that.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.334">How Camreta does his job doesn't -- that claim doesn't belong to him; it belongs to the entity who is telling him how to do his job.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.355">And so why don't we go back to Justice Ginsburg's question of why isn't the Monell situation the proper case?</text>
            <text syncTime="407.580">Because there, it's the party interested in how its officers will do their job at its directive.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.186">It has the case and controversy at issue, not S.G.--</text>

            <text syncTime="527.507">Moreover, this case, even if one strips out the ongoing motion that's been made in the district court, resembles in all material respects Erie v. Pap's A.M., where the Court found that there was standing to bring the case and it was not moot.</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.551">I think there are two examples that help to illustrate the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.503">The first is the City of Erie v. Pap's A.M. case, in which this Court decided to review a State court injunction entered in favor of a plaintiff who no longer had what we would think of as an Article III stake in the case by the time the case reached this Court.</text>
