            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">-- just summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.027" offset="120539">The accident occurred in France and the defective tire that allegedly caused the bus to overturn was made and sold in Europe.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.274" offset="149483">In this case, the accident occurred at a workplace in New Jersey and the manufacturer of the machine, a UK company, wanted to sell its products anywhere and everywhere in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.790" offset="203504">In neither case was the U.S. forum one that could properly exercise general, all-purpose jurisdiction over the foreign defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.299" offset="241643">But in this case, contrary to the Court's judgment, specific jurisdiction would be appropriately exercised by New Jersey courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.266" offset="277483">Indeed, what form is more appropriate than one in the place where McIntyre UK's machine was shipped, installed and malfunction severing local worker, Nicastro's fingers.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.509" offset="338401">The plaintiff and witnesses to the accident are in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.095" offset="352820">The law normally applicable to industrial accidents is the law of the place of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.091" offset="372778">And of prime importance, the foreign manufacturer sought deliberately to develop a market for its machines anywhere and everywhere in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.024" offset="416455">The pattern presented here is familiar in today's international commercial relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.407" offset="442055">A foreign industrialist seeks to attract U.S. purchases for the products it manufactures.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.828" offset="467759">McIntyre UK did so in typical fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.999" offset="480402">It engaged a U.S. distributor to promote its products.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.718" offset="495240">It attended and exhibited at annual trade shows and other demonstrations in diverse U.S. locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.438" offset="522198">It hoped to derive substantial revenue from sales to U.S. purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.511" offset="542469">And indeed, for some years, sales of McIntyre UK's products to U.S. purchases compared favorably to sales made to buyers in the rest of the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.923" offset="592102">Where in the United States buyers resided?</text>
            <text syncTime="124.791" offset="603596">New Jersey or Nevada, matter not at all to McIntyre UK.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.801" offset="619583">It's goal was to sell as much as it could, wherever it could and it had liability insurance concerning personal injuries caused by its products.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.011" offset="656468">Although, nothing impeded it from targeting only particular States, it excluded no region or State from the market it wished to reach hardly “at home” in each State as its market.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.323" offset="709653">Rather than the United States as a whole, New Jersey would have been an unlikely candidate for exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.092" offset="736716">McIntyre UK made machines used in recycling metals and New Jersey recycles more metals than any other states of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.238">There are two things McIntyre UK clearly did not want, subjection to US courts and judgment under the product liability law of any State of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.506">To that end, it heavily avoided shipping directly to the United States and engaged in exclusive U.S. distributor to deliver its products stateside.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.872">Should that manner of marketing have enabled to escape jurisdiction in a State where one of its products is sold, installed and because of the defect in design or in the manufacturing process, causes injury to a local user.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.010">"Of course, not" would be a sensible answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.726">But under today's judgment, McIntyre UK is free to seek out U.S. customers nationwide, yet enjoy immunity from suit in any and every State.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.713">Our prior decisions call for no such result.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.766">First, they plainly reject the notion affecting the plurality opinion that a foreign defendant must somehow submit to the jurisdiction of a state court in order to legitimize the course exercise of adjudicatory authority over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.146">This Court has said repeatedly the fairness, judged by the relationship among the defendant, the forum and the episode in suit is what counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.019">Fictions of implied consent, prior decisions teach do not advance the proper inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.601">If fairness is the central concept in determining questions of personal jurisdiction as we have said it is, then one might ask, “Is it not fair and reasonable given the mode of trading," of which this case is an example, “to require the international seller of a dangerous product to defend at the place of its product causes injury?”</text>
            <text syncTime="277.881">On what measure of reason and fairness can it be considered undue to require McIntyre UK to defend in New Jersey as an incident of these efforts to develop a market for its industrial machines anywhere and everywhere in the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="294.334">Is not the burden on McIntyre UK to defend in New Jersey a reasonable cause of transacting business internationally in comparison to the burden on New Jersey work on Nicastro to go to Nottingham, England, transporting his witnesses with him to gain recompense for an injury sustained using McIntyre's product at his workplace in Saddle Brook, New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.846">Some 30 years ago, this Court said that when a manufacturer or distributor aims to sell its products to customers in several States, it is reasonable to subject it to suit in any one of the States if it’s allegedly defective product.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.490">Has there been the source of injury?</text>
            <text syncTime="337.638">The Court was -- is right then as it is wrong today.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.671">In the past marking case in this area, International Shoe Company against Washington, the Court observed that an estimate of inconveniences is relevant in determining whether appropriate defendant maybe called on to respond away from its home or principal place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.694">In undertaking such an estimate, courts have differently appraised two situations.One, cases involving a local plaintiff like Nicastro injured in his home State by the activity of a defendant like McIntyre UK engaged in international trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.019">And cases in which the defendant is a natural or a legal person, whose economic activities and legal involvements are largely home based, one who harbors no designs to gain substantial revenue from sales and distant markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.280">This case fits the first category, a local plaintiff injured by the activity of a manufacturer seeking to exploit a multistate or global market.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.829">On any fair estimate of the inconveniences, Nicastro should prevail before this Court for the reasons just stated developed further in the dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.260">Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan and I would hold McIntyre UK answerable in New Jersey for the harm Nicastro has suffered using McIntyre's UK shearing machine at his workplace in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.163">While I dissent from the Court's judgment, I take heart that the plurality opinion does not speak for the Court for that opinion, takes a giant step back from the course this Court has pursued since International Shoe and would restore a way of thinking about personal jurisdiction long discredited for its detachment from the realities of today's trading relationships.</text>
