            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">The Freedom of Information Act, better known as FOIA generally requires the Federal Government to make its records available to the public on request.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.039" offset="149567">But FOIA contains nine exemptions, nine categories of material that the Government does not have to disclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.694" offset="184153">In this case, concerns the meaning of one of those exemptions, Exemption 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.364" offset="206827">According to that exemption, the Government need not disclose records that relates solely and I'm quoting now, "that relate to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency".</text>
            <text syncTime="39.032" offset="261580">Now this case started when the Navy received a FOIA request for something called Explosive Safety Quantity Distance Information for a naval base in Puget Sound, Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.433" offset="315183">That's a $10 term but what it means is this, the Navy stores explosive at the space and in order to make sure that the facility is as safe as possible, Navy personnel use various data and maps to show the effect of an explosive device going off.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.309" offset="398670">That information enables them to store the explosives so that even if one does go off, it won't set off a chain reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.404" offset="435033">And the FOIA request here was for those explosive maps and data.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.613" offset="459901">The Navy denied the request based on Exemption 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.261" offset="478501">The Ninth Circuit upheld the Navy's action, but we reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.824" offset="500757">The Navy maybe able to withhold these explosives maps under some other exemption, but it cannot do so by relying on Exemption 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.363" offset="542866">The text of Exemption 2 compels these results, records relating the personnel rules and practices, and that's the key phrase, are records that concerned employee relations and human resources matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.339" offset="598768">This is just a matter of ordinary language, the meaning of the word "personnel" as used in the Exemption to modify rules and practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.701" offset="640251">All of us can think of similar uses of the term personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.552" offset="655611">A personnel department deals with employee relations and problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.231" offset="674314">A personnel agency helps place people in jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.096" offset="689779">And the personnel file which is a term FOIA also uses in another exemption is the file containing information about an employee's work history.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.193" offset="730216">In all of these cases, the word "personnel" is a synonym for HR or Human Resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.616" offset="759892">Congress meant the same thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.157" offset="770027">Personnel rules and practices are rules and practices relating to the conditions of employment in federal agencies, hiring and firing, work rules and discipline, compensation and benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.609" offset="819869">So for example, if an agency record has to do with employee pay or parking or vacations, it falls within the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.637" offset="859993">But almost needless to say a record about the effects of detonating an explosive device does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.153" offset="889981">And so the Navy cannot withhold these records under Exemption 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.296" offset="910566">The Ninth Circuit held otherwise in reliance on an old DC Circuit decision that adopted a much broader interpretation of Exemption 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.114" offset="949854">Under that decision, the Government could also withhold any internal materials whose release would risk circumvention of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.808" offset="984649">Today, we reject that interpretation as inconsistent with Exemption 2's text and its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.879" offset="1016936">We recognized that the Government may have good reasons to protect these explosives maps and other similar materials and we do not say today that the Navy must release these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.021" offset="1065524">Other FOIA exemptions may shield them.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.332" offset="1078794">The Navy argued below that Exemption 7 which protects certain law enforcement records applies to the explosive data and that argument remains open to the Government on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.124" offset="1129890">In addition, Exemption 1 prevents access to classified documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.575" offset="1151728">That exemption ensures that the Government can withhold documents whose disclosure would compromise national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.627" offset="1183911">We hold today just one thing that the government cannot withhold these records on the basis of an exemption that covers and was meant to cover only employee relations matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.627" offset="1235947">Justice Alito has filed a concurring opinion and Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
