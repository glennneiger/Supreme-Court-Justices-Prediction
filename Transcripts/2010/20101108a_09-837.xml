            <text syncTime="232.789" offset="1036581">There is not a supervising attending physician standing over their shoulder at every moment, but they are being supervised at all the time during their residency program; that is to say that the work that they do is under the supervision, in that broad sense, of an attending physician who looks over what they do, comments on what they do, and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.186" offset="6290119">They are full-time employees, and the Treasury Department has reasonably concluded that an employee's paid work does not make him an exempt student, even if he also learns from his job.</text>

            <text syncTime="1565.614" offset="6367859">Instead, it's a narrow exemption that applies only to students performing services for a school, college, or university where they are enrolled and regularly attending classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.924" offset="6401087">And second, when employees are working long hours and being paid substantial amounts, they and their employers should be helping to fund the Social Security system, and they should be earning credit towards benefits so that they and their families will have something to fall back on if they become disabled or die.</text>

            <text syncTime="1683.828" offset="6840780">And so the Treasury reasonably concluded that because this isn't a general exemption for apprenticeships, that they shouldn't construe it as providing a special exemption for apprentices who happen to be employed by schools, colleges, and universities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.977" offset="6929283">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.849" offset="6936806">If they would -- if their work -- I mean, here, basically, they have work and the argument is that that work qualifies them as students.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.988" offset="6985394">And what the Treasury Department has concluded is that it's going to treat work and study as distinct categories in deciding whether somebody is predominantly a student, and that it's not going to count the work as study even if there's some educational component to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.558" offset="7067627">And that's reasonable for several reasons, as I said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.931" offset="7081106">First, because the statute just isn't a general provision that's designed to cover apprenticeships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.069" offset="7105661">And second, because when people are primarily workers and they are working for long hours, they should be covered and participating in the FICA system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.313" offset="7154667">And finally, it would be very difficult to determine on a case-by-case basis what's their purpose: What the employer's purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.121" offset="7193955">You know, is this job more like study?</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.009" offset="7201479">Is this job more like work?</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.276" offset="7206494">And on that basis -- and to, on that basis, decide whether that should make them a student.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.975" offset="7233348">So considering all of those things, the Treasury has decided to draw a bright line and say: Study is study; work is work; and if you are not a student independently of that, then your work doesn't make you a student.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.905" offset="7297087">And the Treasury has also decided that if you are working full-time, that then you are predominantly an employee rather than predominantly a student, and you are not covered by the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.338" offset="7342749">In addition, FICA's historical development indicates that the student exemption doesn't cover medical residents, because at the same time that Congress enacted the student exemption, it also enacted a separate exemption for medical interns, and it decided not to include residents in that exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.938" offset="7409204">And those actions would have made little sense if the student exemption had the scope asserted by Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.655" offset="7432088">And then in 1965 Congress repealed the intern exemption in order to give young doctors an earlier start in building up Social Security coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.527" offset="7467510">And that repeal also wouldn't have achieved its purpose if many and most residents were covered -- were excluded from FICA under the student exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.602" offset="7507843">These residents are people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.083" offset="7525710">They are working between 50 and 80 hours a week.</text>

            <text syncTime="2290.822" offset="9268705">In addition, as a practical matter, the way the Social Security Administration determines whether people get coverage for a particular period under the Social Security Act is they look at the W-2's that come in.</text>
