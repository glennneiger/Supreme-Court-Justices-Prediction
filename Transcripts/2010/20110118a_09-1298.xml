            <text syncTime="14.124" offset="161896">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.593" offset="171823">The proposition that Petitioners are here challenging is the one adopted or embraced by the Federal Circuit that says that the United States Government can declare that certain of its government contracting partners have operated in default and under those circumstances can reach into the government contractor's pocket, withdraw at the time $1.35 billion of monies that were spent by the United States, but for services that were rendered, without question, pursuant to the contract, pursuant to the instructions of the United States Government, and that when the contractor seeks to defend against the claim that it has engaged in some kind of default conduct, that the government can assert the state-secrets privilege and in so doing deprive the contractor of the ability effectively to respond to the government's conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.061" offset="385714">Under those circumstances, it seems to me that the statement in this Court's decision in United States v. Reynolds, which is that the government is certainly free to assert the state-secrets privilege, but when it does so it has to assume certain responsibilities that come from it, at least in the circumstances where the United States is the moving party.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="91.974" offset="473276">Mr. Phillips, when the contractors -- when they failed to deliver the first aircraft at the time specified by the contract, their reason was that its costs would far outrun the contract price, and so it sought to reformulate the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.007" offset="565436">At that time -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I think at that time the contractor said nothing at all about superior knowledge and the government's obligation to share information that it hadn't shared.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.968" offset="633250">There was nothing specific with respect to that, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.920" offset="649132">The first time the contractors identified the superior knowledge problem arose, obviously, when the government took the extraordinary step of issuing a cure notice, because up until that point, obviously, the parties are attempting to negotiate and work to a final resolution of this project, as you would hope any contracting entities would, to bring the contract to a happy resolution, so--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="158.951" offset="741188">But you would expect them to say, if that was the impediment to going forward on this contract, to at least mention it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="166.455" offset="771281">--Well, I think you have to put it in context, Justice Ginsburg, because during this period of time, obviously, there were consistent efforts and requests being made to get access to both the B-2 and the A-117 stealth technologies, and there were discussions that went back and forth, and the district court -- and the Court of Federal Claims specifically held, eventually the information was forthcoming, but it was, candidly, too little and too late to effectively allow the contract to proceed as -- as planned.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.744" offset="896355">So I think -- I mean, I agree, you know, in a perfect world, maybe you would have identified this.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.727" offset="1012339">I haven't found anywhere in the contract that it requires the U.S. to share information with you.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.557" offset="1087676">Let's assume the contract required the sharing of state secrets and the government then invokes its privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.413" offset="1123098">Is that a different case than this one in terms of due process?</text>
            <text syncTime="259.381" offset="1142951">Wouldn't the -- wouldn't the former situation, where it's been made a condition of the contract, require a different treatment than this situation where the government's just saying, if you want to raise a defense that's not part of the contract, then you do what every other litigant with a privilege does -- who a privilege has been invoked against; you proceed with whatever evidence you have.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.888" offset="1280982">And we would have been perfectly content to proceed with the evidence we had.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.340" offset="1294775">But the ultimate decision by the Court of Federal Claims was that it was impossible to ultimately be in a position to resolve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.577" offset="1319748">But I want to answer your more fundamental question, Your Honor as to the -- the basic point is that the background principle of law, the superior knowledge defense, is the understanding of the parties when they enter into an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.884" offset="1372933">I mean, that would have been true just as much in the Helene Curtis case and the other cases where the Federal Circuit has acknowledged the superior knowledge defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.406" offset="1403026">That's been around for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.922" offset="1409087">It's an understood basis on which the parties enter into an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.208" offset="1426223">That's the first answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.460" offset="1431239">The second answer is that you're asking us to put into a contract something about information that we don't know anything about.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.130" offset="1457988">I mean, we have some sense about the B-2 and the A-117, but we don't know anything about the other programs that are identified here.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.373" offset="1518905">I thought your claim was that you were promised this information and you structured the contract based on that promise.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="361.443" offset="1551193">Well, our claim -- we have separate -- we have a series of distinct claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.079" offset="1565717">Our first claim is that we never would have entered into the contract in the first place if the government had provided us with information based on its superior knowledge that, for instance, the weight specifics that we were being asked to provide or to supply were literally impossible to comply with based on what the government already knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.393" offset="1643039">If we had been just told that much, just given a warning, we wouldn't be in the situation where we are here.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="390.713" offset="1668221">Well, there's a factual dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.931" offset="1677103">I think somewhere I read that there is a claim that they told you your weight estimates weren't right.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.501" offset="1703434">Well -- I mean, there may be a factual dispute, but I'd be -- and I would be happy to litigate that issue if we can get to that point where we are in fact allowed to litigate any aspects of our particular defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.159" offset="1754008">But the bottom line here is, and again to state the proposition as starkly as it is because this is the way it comes to the Court from the Federal Circuit, they're saying that the government can assert a claim for $1.35 billion dollars against us and tell us that we cannot defend against that claim even though the reason why we were unable to comply with the contract is because of the fact that the government didn't provide us information either at the outset or as we went along--</text>

            <text syncTime="468.060" offset="1977616">But let me give you the other question because some time in your argument I would like you to get to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.864" offset="1992871">And that is, if we accept as a principle of law what was said in Reynolds, a criminal case or whatever, and apply it to government contracting, where sophisticated contractors are perfectly capable of negotiating their own contract, we are not just throwing a monkey wrench into the gears of government contracting; we're throwing the whole monkey.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.361" offset="2078866">That's my second question.</text>

            <text syncTime="497.396" offset="2094958">One, this isn't a case that calls for it; and, two, the threat to government contracting by changing from Reynolds to here is overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.704" offset="2136231">Now, I would like your views on both of those.</text>

            <text syncTime="511.906" offset="2153054">--Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.189" offset="2154203">Well, it seems to me clearly that this is the precise situation where Reynolds is saying if you cannot bring forward a legitimate defense -- I mean, part of the problem is we don't know precisely what information we didn't have and were never entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.998" offset="2205403">So it's very difficult to say how strong is our defense under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.200" offset="2222226">What we do know is that the Court of Federal Claims judge looked very carefully at this and said that we had made an impressive showing without regard to any of the confidential or privileged information of a prima facie defense in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.091" offset="2277815">So our position is we had a very valid defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.043" offset="2289622">This is not pretextual.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.309" offset="2294638">We're not throwing this in simply as a mechanism to force the government to assert its state secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.613" offset="2315849">That's a fairly contrived approach to litigation, and frankly not something that I could imagine any circumstance in which we would do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.017" offset="2345524">Two, I don't see how this throws a monkey wrench into this process whatsoever, much less throws out the monkey, because the basic understanding here is that the government is not entitled to force its contractor down a ruinous course.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.662" offset="2416055">If the government has information available to it, then it has to make that information -- has to be forthcoming with the information with the contractor, either at the outset, which would have been the best of all circumstances here, or as matters go along.</text>

            <text syncTime="629.678" offset="2624094">So our understanding at the time we entered into this agreement is that if there were a problem with the way the contracting officer operated, we would be allowed to file a claim and immediately take the contracting officer's rule off the table.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.986" offset="2669338">Under those circumstances, it seems to me all we're asking for is to go back to the status quo ante in that situation, which means there's no contracting officer decision, there's no basis on which the government can make a claim for 1.35 billion, now $3 billion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3075.884" offset="12408936">Not just can the sophisticated parties agree ahead of time to other things, but also the whole notion of due process in contracts is odd, because the government has waived its sovereign immunity only since 1855.</text>
