            <text syncTime="10.619" offset="147895">Having successfully completed drug treatment in prison, and having come home to succeed as a college student, valued employee, and family man, Jason Pepper presents to this Court two questions: Whether post-sentencing rehabilitation is a permissible basis for a downward variance from the sentencing guidelines at resentencing, and whether the district court judge in Pepper's resentencing was bound by the law of the case doctrine in its 5K departure ruling absent new facts, changes in the controlling law, or to avoid a manifest injustice.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.338" offset="290732">Post-sentencing rehabilitation has traditionally been a relevant factor for judges to consider and is now a permissible ground for a non-guideline sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.272" offset="326468">3553(a) and 3661 are the authorities permitting post-sentencing rehabilitation as a consideration for variance.</text>

            <text syncTime="92.490" offset="475366">The law of the case doctrine is what you refer to as a matter that is left in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.347" offset="498772">The other issue of the -- whether or not the individual qualifies for downward variance is a completely separate issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.028" offset="537537">The law of the case remains with the district court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.851" offset="548822">In the other issue that we have, it's whether or not he's entitled to a downward variance based upon the book of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.929" offset="577139">So they are not, in fact, the same issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.435" offset="663134">The -- the judgment has been vacated, the sentence has been vacated, so how does the law of the case survive?</text>

            <label>Mr. Alfredo Parrish</label>
            <text syncTime="151.695" offset="712244">--The law of the case survives on a couple of basic principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.053" offset="725619">One, there has to be new facts that the district court judge heard; there has to be a change of controlling law; and there has to be a reason to avoid a manifest justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.486" offset="763340">If you go back to the 5K, one departure that the first judge made the decision on, that law -- that was law of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.092" offset="797821">That percentage followed Mr. Pepper straight through the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.730" offset="812345">That's a totally separate ruling from any of the other factors in this case that relate to his downward variance.</text>

            <text syncTime="205.033" offset="925508">Was there a change of controlling law?</text>
            <text syncTime="206.936" offset="933136">The reason we do this is because we want to have confidence in that decision to make sure litigants don't go judge shopping.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.183" offset="958109">So that's part of the reason this law of the case doctrine is in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.228" offset="970334">Even in Judge Posner's Second Circuit decision we cite in our brief, you defer to the first judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.988" offset="993322">But any time a judge can reconsider, there is no problem with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.237" offset="1006383">The law of the case in the 5K departure, when the first district judge heard substantial evidence with regard to the issue of cooperation, and that's what he did.</text>

            <text syncTime="469.030" offset="1981586">If they become mandatory on remand, the problem is that nobody gets the advantage of the Booker remedial ruling of it directly, and all sentences on remand are mandatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1074.908" offset="4405018">That is true for four primary reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.782" offset="4412541">First, it's undisputed that post-sentencing rehabilitation is logically irrelevant to statutory sentencing factors in 3553(a), including the need for deterrents and the need to protect the safety of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.760" offset="4464473">Second, the guidelines themselves authorize consideration of presentencing rehabilitation to a limited extent, because it's permissible under the guidelines to consider presentencing rehabilitation in selecting a sentence with inside the guideline range.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.235" offset="4522360">What the guidelines do prohibit, and there is a provision in the guidelines that does prohibit the -- a departure from the guidelines based on post-sentencing rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.625" offset="4551931">The guidelines prohibit that, but the judgment of the commission about how much weight that factor can be given after Booker in an advisory guideline regime is advisory rather than mandatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1126.836" offset="4612744">And third, contrary to the suggestion of the amicus, there is no general principle in our law that at a resentencing, new information may not be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.395" offset="4659033">To the contrary, the consistent assumption of the law is that at a resentencing, you take the defendant as you find him as of the time of resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.109" offset="4689857">That is clear from this Court's decisions in Pierce and in Wasman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.029" offset="4701560">It is clear from the large body of cases from the lower courts cited in Petitioner's brief at pages 42 through 44.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.979" offset="4729354">That's the way the guidelines operate, so there is no general principle that you cannot consider new information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.619" offset="4755895">Now, it's true, as Justice Alito's question suggested earlier, that that can result in differences of opportunity, where one defendant will have an opportunity for a resentence and new information will be considered as to that defendant; a similarly situated defendant will not get a resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.940" offset="4817230">But that opportunity is sometimes referred to as "luck".</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.545" offset="4835621">First, can be good luck or bad luck, and to take the example Justice Alito gave of two twins, if you have an example of two defendants who are twins who are each convicted of an offense -- let's say burglary -- and they are given very lenient sentences, and because the judge looks at their record at the time and determines that they are sympathetic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.210" offset="4914301">They are don't have a prior criminal record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.474" offset="4919317">One of them's conviction, you know, has no claims of legal error relative to his conviction; he gets no resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.444" offset="4943245">The other gets a resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.066" offset="4949723">By the time of resentencing, it has become clear that that defendant had previously committed several murders, and he's -- you know, murdered -- has also committed a subsequent murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.189" offset="4982220">There is no question that at that resentencing, that information would be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.732" offset="5000296">There is no question there would be a disparity, and it would be true even if, let's say, those earlier murders had been committed by both of the twins together.</text>

            <text syncTime="2354.416" offset="9523033">There is an opportunity for that to be reflected in a -- in a separate criminal prosecution and a -- and a sentencing for that conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.961" offset="9553230">When -- when the sentencing guidelines were created and when 3742(g) was passed, all of this was done against the backdrop of a sense that the sentencing guidelines were to focus on avoiding unwarranted disparities, but as the Court observed in Booker, sentencing similar -- similar sentences for similar crimes conducted in similar ways.</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.108" offset="9897838">And I think that purpose was valid before Booker, and I think it's actually even more important after Booker.</text>

            <text syncTime="2479.629" offset="10023957">And in this case it's uniquely in the hands of the defendant to create, then you are going to create essentially a procedural merry-go-round where a district court will impose a 24 month sentence, the Government will appeal, the court of appeals will think that is substantively unreasonable, it will be remanded to the district court and they will say, well, in the interim this person has rehabilitated them self, they have gotten a job and they've gone to school.</text>

            <text syncTime="2586.737" offset="10452365">That is a product of the fact that this statute was drafted before Booker and didn't have the benefit of knowing how Booker was going to come out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2787.324" offset="11254742">They are supposed to do that under Congressional statute now, 3553(c), they are supposed to do that in open court very clearly and in certain circumstances they are supposed to do it -- they are supposed to do it in writing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2802.166" offset="11314092">Now, the parts that's not necessarily to deal with later, the part that's confusing me is where this word variance comes into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.254" offset="11350455">Because I think the word departure would normally, normally cover the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.392" offset="11366964">And then when it gets to the court of appeals, the court of appeals, whether they are inside the guideline or outside the guideline and have departed, reviews the matter for, you know, inside it had departed or outside, those situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.872" offset="11432897">It says in Booker the standard is to review for reasonableness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2839.429" offset="11463095">I think in the context of 3742(g) that's one of the linguistic vestiges of the guidelines, which is that up until Irizarry the Court itself used the terms variance and departure interchangeably because a variance didn't exist prior to Booker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.548" offset="11531640">The Court obviously spoke to the question of whether or not it was going to equate a variance and a departure in the context of rule 32(h) in Irizarry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.949" offset="11581168">I don't think actually that that distinction was essential to the holding in Irizarry and I think could be limited there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.151" offset="11602066">I think particularly where the court is trying to avoid invalidating a duly enacted statute, some flexibility in terms of interpreting departure in 3742(g)(2)(B) would be warranted and you would essentially say that to the extended that a court is varying or departing, that they would need to articulate the reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.931" offset="11901116">The problem, to be very specific, is I think the following: The first sentencing, the judge applies the guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.520" offset="11939464">He says there was $300,000 stolen from the bank, I look it up over here and I get sentence X.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.268" offset="11970497">On appeal the appellate court says you should have counted the securities as money taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.062" offset="11993694">So it's 1,300,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.516" offset="12003516">So go and apply guideline Y.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.483" offset="12015323">He goes back and looks at Y, it's a very high number, and thinks given certain circumstances which make this case unusual, I want to depart downward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.182" offset="12062135">Now, I would have thought that the judge's behavior in that second instance would have violated Apprendi, because that judge was either going to sentence even without the departure on the basis of him having taken some securities worth a million dollars which was not a fact that went to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.736" offset="12144368">There it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.830" offset="12152728">Or he has to throw aside the guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.312" offset="12166625">But this statute says you can't throw aside the guidelines, and you can't depart for a reason that wasn't previously given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.308" offset="12194628">So this statute is -- is forcing him to sentence on the basis of a fact that was not found by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.946" offset="12229214">I think that's the argument for saying it violates Apprendi.</text>

            <text syncTime="3060.496" offset="12347392">Or does it ultimately determine that it is -- it is essentially not capable of a saving construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.261" offset="12366514">I think it is capable of a saving construction; I think it is capable of a saving construction in a couple of ways that avoid most of the problems that have been articulated by -- by both Petitioner and government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.083" offset="12409772">The first, which actually Petitioner points out in his reply brief, is in 3742(g) itself, there is this language about "except that", that appears to limit the -- the ability of the district court to actually follow the mandate of the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.969" offset="12473302">I don't think that that can be read to limit the mandate in the court of appeals, nor do I think that anyone is suggesting that 3742(g) changes the rule in Harper v. Virginia Department of -- of Taxation, the idea that -- that district courts obviously would have to give the benefit of intervening changes in -- in law in judicial decisions; and so Booker which has been used as an example, Booker on remand would likely have been entitled to a -- a resentencing, a resentencing based on factors that the district court judge could have considered at the time of the original sentencing, but now in light of Booker, basically a do-over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.108" offset="12637874">And for a -- for a small section of cases, I think that would work.</text>

            <text syncTime="3415.584" offset="14239598">Initially I said it was apples and oranges, and it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.599" offset="14239493">On two separate occasions after the 5 K ruling had been made by District Court Judge Bennett, it was appealed twice to the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.269" offset="14239389">After it was appealed twice to the Eighth Circuit, they had an abuse of discretion standard they could have used to resolve it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3434.435" offset="14239180">They upheld it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.640" offset="14239075">Then it was sent back down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.683" offset="14238971">After it had come up on an original writ to this Court, this Court vacated the Eighth Circuit opinion, sent that opinion back down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.276" offset="14238866">But the law of the case, as you said, Mr. Chief Justice Roberts, still remained with the district court on the initial ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.426" offset="14238762">The initial ruling that Judge Bennett made with regard to the 5K departure was a separate ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.376" offset="14238657">Now the Eighth Circuit in its own analysis of how you interpret its remand, we disagree with the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.314" offset="14238553">They said they -- you look at the analysis of the case to determine the remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.342" offset="14238448">And in that instance, we believe that the remand was the analysis of the case that the 5K departure remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.496" offset="14238344">No new facts came in, no new controlling law came into place, and there was no manifest in justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3492.630" offset="14238135">We believe the Court should reverse -- vacate the Eighth Circuit Court of opinion case regarding post-sentencing rehabilitation, remand with direction from this Court consistent with an opinion that requires the court to impose a sentence that does not exceed 24 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.858" offset="14238030">And, Justice Ginsburg, we did mention on page 33 of our brief, the 3742(g)(2) as a footnote, when the case first came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.809" offset="14237926">But the Eighth Circuit, as you all know, did not use that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.761" offset="14237821">They used an old rule that was in effect from the Sims case to impose the sentence.</text>
