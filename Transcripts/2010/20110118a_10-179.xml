            <text syncTime="146.225" offset="690301">And -- well, the answer is that under -- under the various theories that this Court has put forth, there is a basis for the Bankruptcy Court to adjudicate a proof of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.614" offset="731888">One theory, of course, is the public rights theory, and in Granfinanciera this Court established that the -- the public rights theory was broader than just the kind of situation where the government was a party, and it said that -- that it -- public rights are defined as whether Congress acting under Article I has created a seemingly private right that is so closely integrated into a public regulatory scheme as to be a matter appropriate for agency resolution with limited involvement by the Article III judiciary.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kent L. Richland</label>
            <text syncTime="197.508" offset="895415">That's -- that's correct, but this Court has never held that in fact the claim had to be created by -- literally created by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.363" offset="922896">What this Court has always talked about is, is -- is the claim one that Congress has established as being applicable within the system, but that may be based on a State law claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.838" offset="968767">For example, when this Court analyzed the claims which were at issue in Granfinanciera, it looked at the fact that they were fundamental common law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.681" offset="1028117">It didn't depend on the fact that they were Federal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.716" offset="1044313">The same thing was -- is true in the way that the -- that this Court analyzed the -- the claim in -- in Marathon itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.239" offset="1078376">It made the determination that because this was, I think the way Justice Rehnquist stated it was: This is the stuff that would have been adjudicated at common law in Westminster in 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.265" offset="1138458">So it was not the Federal or State nature of the claim, it was the fact that these were common law claims that made it important.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.787" offset="1172522">Suppose that Congress had authorized bankruptcy courts to decide contract disputes between two creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kent L. Richland</label>
            <text syncTime="276.377" offset="1210974">I think that there are limits, and they must be related to the purpose of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.531" offset="1235529">I think that, that a -- that sort of thing would be related to perhaps, within the "related to" jurisdiction of bankruptcy, and that would fall within the problems identified in Granfinanciera, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.438" offset="1291222">That would be beyond the scope of what could be adjudicated in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.242" offset="1310344">But what we are talking about here is claims and counterclaims that are at the essence of what bankruptcy courts do.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.479" offset="1339288">The bankruptcy system, of course, is set up in order to adjudicate claims to a limited amount of money, and in order to do that in an efficient manner, in a manner that will not utilize the entire amount of the -- the estate in the adjudication process, it set up the bankruptcy courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.392" offset="1419013">And so they are set up in order to be efficient, effective, and as soon as, of course, as we get an Article III court involved, that really does place some brakes on the efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.617" offset="1463839">It becomes much more costly.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kent L. Richland</label>
            <text syncTime="354.043" offset="1521622">--Well, certainly the statute -- 157(b)(3)-2 -- does not distinguish between compulsory and permissive counterclaims, and it's also true that this Court's authority in Granfinanciera, in Langenkamp and in Katchen.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.802" offset="1584630">The rationale of those cases is broad enough to encompass permissive counterclaims, but this Court need not reach that issue in this case, because here we do have -- what both the court of appeals below and what seems to have been conceded by Respondents is, indeed, a compulsory counterclaim.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="387.947" offset="1657250">Mr. Richland, isn't there this difference: Just to take ordinary civil procedure, compulsory counterclaim doesn't have to satisfy any jurisdictional requirements, because it comes in under the wing of the main claim, but a permissive counterclaim has to independently satisfy jurisdictional requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.778" offset="1740528">So that could be a reason, even though the Bankruptcy Code just says counterclaim, to distinguish the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.967" offset="1777309">If there's an authority to deal with the claim, then there's authority to deal with the counterclaim; but if it's a permissive counterclaim, if it's not based on the same transaction or premise, then it would have to be a self-standing claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.559" offset="1843660">But, as you -- as you have said, this case does present what the parties have agreed is a compulsory counterclaim.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kent L. Richland</label>
            <text syncTime="443.749" offset="1880440">Well, I -- I think that -- that is an excellent justification for why one might want to make this a very narrow determination in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.855" offset="1912832">In fact, Justice Rehnquist in his concurring opinion in Marathon said that this is an area which is very touchy and difficult and complex, and it is one where we particularly should not, as a court, go beyond the facts of the individual case and what must be decided for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.851" offset="1988796">Of course, the other thing about compulsory counterclaims and what makes it more applicable in this kind of situation in an Article III setting is that, according to the Schor analysis, what we are talking about is how much of an intrusion on the Article III process are we talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.063" offset="2065701">And if we assume, as appears to have been assumed here, that the claim itself may be determined by the Bankruptcy Court, then the net intrusion by determining a counterclaim, a compulsory counterclaim, is much, much smaller, because there almost inevitably will be overlap between what must be decided by the Bankruptcy Court and what -- on the claim, and what must be on the counterclaim.</text>

            <text syncTime="536.544" offset="2251588">But in fact, what happened here was something much, much more than just a motion, a request for determination of nondischargeability, because one month after that was filed, the actual proof of claim itself was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.202" offset="2306236">And all the courts below have uniformly concluded that when that additional step is taken, it could have no purpose other than to present the claim -- beyond just the question of dischargeability, present the question of liquidation of the claim to the Bankruptcy Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="580.990" offset="2429430">The -- the statutory structure here is something that -- it has been suggested that this is a question of statutory interpretation and that in fact the statute does not provide for this kind of treatment, that in fact there is a two-step process by which one determines whether a Bankruptcy Court can finally decide a counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.188" offset="2522216">But I think that really is belied by the plain language of the statute as well as the statutory structure.</text>

            <text syncTime="684.557" offset="2843627">But 152 -- 157(b)(2)(C) is very straightforward.</text>

            <text syncTime="770.079" offset="3185727">So for those particular categories, the lower courts have been comfortable with the idea that we look at the language of the statute, apply those words and use those as limitations, but with respect to the specific categories from (B) to (N), the courts have uniformly indicated that those categories do not require further interpretation, that they are straightforward and they constitute core proceedings on their face.</text>

            <text syncTime="818.060" offset="3377674">And the reason for that is that if we look to Schor and Schor's Article III analysis, we can see that it really divides into two parts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1132.710" offset="4636254">I think this particular statute doesn't create that risk, because the use of bankruptcy judges is entirely under the control of the district judges.</text>

            <text syncTime="1195.701" offset="4888179">And as a matter of history and tradition, one of the consequences that follows from the assertion of an affirmative claim is subjection to counterclaims, and especially compulsory counterclaims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1347.832" offset="5496728">Now, it's true that the initial, the State law claim, the defamation claim that was made the basis for the claim against the estate, was a State law cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.605" offset="5535807">But as this Court said in Katchen v. Landy, the effect of the commencement of the bankruptcy case is to convert the claimant's potential legal claim against the defendant into an equitable claim against the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.750" offset="5600381">And Respondent's equitable claim against the estate seeking a share of the assets was a claim created by Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.672" offset="5632146">That is, it's true that in the course of deciding whether Respondent was ultimately entitled to a share of the estate, the Bankruptcy Court would have been required to adjudicate State law questions and conduct something like the same proceedings that could have arisen in a State case, but actually obtaining a share of the bankruptcy estate requires more than that there be a valid debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.752" offset="5716470">The whole point of bankruptcy is to deal with situations in which the debtor doesn't have enough assets to go around, and so the Bankruptcy Court will have to not only determine whether a valid debt exists, but what are the relative priorities of various creditors, what is the appropriate pro rata share for a particular claimant, and all of that is to be resolved under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.563" offset="5795673">So, when Respondent filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy case, it was asserting a Federal right cognizable under the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.653" offset="5828065">And again, none of the -- none of the analogues that I have identified are precisely analogous to this one, but I think it's noteworthy that Respondent cites no contrary authority from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.263" offset="5886474">That is, Respondent cites no case in which a claimant has invoked the authority of a particular court and has asked for affirmative relief, and this Court has held that it nevertheless had a constitutional entitlement to be free of counterclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.256" offset="5946452">And that seems particularly true of compulsory counterclaims, both because they are counterclaims that our legal system affirmatively encourages to be brought within the same proceeding and for the reason that Justice Ginsburg said, that in an analogous area of the law when we ask whether there is Federal court jurisdiction over a counterclaim to begin with, if the counterclaim is compulsory, there need be no independent basis for jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1642.042" offset="6673596">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.175" offset="6682164">There are three possible grounds for affirmance of the Ninth Circuit in this case, one constitutional and two statutory; and the 157(b)(5) ground which was preserved below received some discussion at the very end of Mr. Stewart's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.035" offset="6733573">But I would like to start the meat of my argument just the way Mr. Stewart started his argument, which is by addressing Justice Scalia's question; and like Mr. Richland, I would like to talk about footnote 14 of the Granfinanciera opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.675" offset="6784146">Now, Granfinanciera had to distinguish Schor, which is the only case in which this Court has ever said a State law claim could be a public right so that it can be adjudicated by a non-Article III forum and not subject to the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.637" offset="6851960">And Schor rested on a consent and waiver rationale and on a structural rationale that an alternative Article III forum was made available by Congress for everyone in Mr. Schor's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.093" offset="6893756">In distinguishing Schor, this Court said in footnote 14:</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.564" offset="6911728">"Parallel reasoning is unavailable in the context of bankruptcy proceedings because creditors lack an alternative forum to the Bankruptcy Court in which to pursue their claims. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.602" offset="6951852">So with respect, this Court has already answered the question Justice Scalia posed by saying a creditor may not be put to that choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1719.708" offset="6984244">Counselor, that sort of begs the question, because I think what I haven't unpackaged -- and I want you to unpackage it with me -- you are obviously not deprived of a State or Federal trial forum to decide your claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.939" offset="7061149">What you're -- what you're deprived of -- you can get your judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1861.318" offset="7550683">It's an entirely different subject when the debtor tries to bring a claim against the creditor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2172.734" offset="8796306">In the part about personal rights, the Court held Mr. Schor had waived his personal right to an Article III forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.221" offset="8822324">In the part about structural rights at page 855 of that opinion, the Court said that it mattered to the constitutional analysis that Congress had made an Article III forum available for pursuit of that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.112" offset="8869867">So it is terribly, terribly important whether an Article III forum is available.</text>

            <text syncTime="2377.195" offset="9614252">And if the canon of constitutional avoidance means anything in limiting the scope of 157(b)(2), it should have just as much application to (C) as it does to (A) and (O), and the -- it is not as analytically neat as some other cases of statutory interpretation, but the most obvious way one is going to limit the reach of (C), as well as (A) and (O), to do so is to take the words Mr. Richland concedes they are used in limiting (A) and (O).</text>

            <text syncTime="2880.862" offset="11628920">Remember, the Bankruptcy Court can hear all of these claims unless they're covered by 157(b)(5).</text>

            <text syncTime="2931.426" offset="11831108">So you can look at a case like Marathon, I mean not -- supervised by Article III entities, not by the president, not by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.114" offset="11865903">So one can look at a case like Marathon and say the problem there was that the president appointed the bankruptcy judges in a way that the president no longer does and that the district courts did not have the supervisory control over the bankruptcy judges in the way that they do now, and that that makes a constitutional difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="2981.007" offset="12029430">It simply means that we've gotten to this non-Article III forum in a way that gives slightly tighter control to the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.410" offset="12059105">But as a whole line of cases, including Crowell v. Benson, suggests, the degree of substantive review of individual decisions by non-Article III tribunals matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.051" offset="12101632">It's not just the front end at which the judges or commissioners or whatever they are of the non-Article III tribunal are selected.</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.057" offset="13397619">But section 522(d)(11) of the code uses the term "bodily injury", so we know that when Congress means bodily injury, it says bodily injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.329" offset="13434713">It's also been suggested that the phrase "personal injury or wrongful death" is a phrase to which the canons of interpretation "noscitur a sociis" and "ejusdem generis" somehow apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.034" offset="13473583">That's not why Congress used personal injury or wrongful death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.403" offset="13487062">Until 1846 with Lord Campbell's Act, the common law of England was that a wrongful death claim didn't survive, couldn't be brought by the -- by the heirs, because the victim of the tort was dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.730" offset="13544323">It is quite common all around the country to use the phrase "personal injury or wrongful death" to make clear that the tort being covered is a tort that resulted in injury to someone who survived or is a tort that resulted in death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.072" offset="13601688">So there's nothing surprising about the use of that phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.357" offset="13614853">It doesn't mean bodily injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.807" offset="13620600">And for those who look at legislative history, there is legislative history indicating quite emphatically that the members of Congress who were responsible for adding 157(b)(5), amending 157(b)(2)(B), amending 157(b)B-O -- and putting the abstention provisions in section 1334(c) really meant for bankruptcy judges to keep their hands off personal injury claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.092" offset="13725821">The main claim in this case that conceivably could have given the Bankruptcy Court jurisdiction, if I lose on the other issues, was Pierce's defamation claim, not Vickie's intentional interference claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.951" offset="13785276">We would respectfully suggest they're both personal injury tort claims, but it's particularly clear that Pierce's defamation claim is an injury to his personal interest in reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.742" offset="13828430">So either by resolving the constitutional issue or through the canon of constitutional avoidance, or simply because it is the best reading of 157(b)(2), this Court should affirm the Ninth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3465.265" offset="13966461">The substantive question whether these particular torts fall within the personal injury exception is a most difficult one, and it is one that this Court really shouldn't take on unless there's a substantial amount more of briefing and input from -- from others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.259" offset="14026439">But the waiver issue is an easy one, and the reason it's an easy one is the record is undisputed that it was 27 months between the time that this claim -- counterclaim was -- the claim was filed and between the time that this personal injury issue was raised in a withdrawal motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.519" offset="14087461">During that period of time there were numerous sanctions motions, and numerous sanctions, discovery sanctions imposed upon Pierce Marshall; and in fact what happened was Judge Keller, before considering the initial withdrawal motion on the merits -- before having a hearing on it, he initially granted the withdrawal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.282" offset="14174501">He then had a hearing, and at the hearing what he said was -- he may not have used the word "timeliness", but what he said is you've chosen this forum, the Bankruptcy Court is immersed in this case, and he used the colorful phrase what you are experiencing here is the spawn of what you have begot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.560" offset="14239702">And I think that that clearly imports the nature that you are too late, you have not brought this in a timely fashion; everything that has happened in the Bankruptcy Court has made it too late for you to come to this court with this--</text>

            <text syncTime="3608.042" offset="14537603">On -- with respect to this issue of State law having some great significance here as opposed to Federal law, that issue has been rejected by this Court.</text>
