            <text syncTime="12.308" offset="154687">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.010" offset="165449">Interconnection is the lifeblood of local phone competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.145" offset="186034">That is why in section 251(c)(2) of the Telecommunications Act Congress guaranteed that competitors would have interconnection at the location and at the method of their choosing and at TELRIC rates irregardless of market impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.006" offset="249459">The question in this case is whether that 251(c)(2) obligation encompasses the tens of thousands of existing entrance facilities that even today are interconnecting competitive and incumbent networks, and the answer--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="50.849" stopTime="52.933">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="50.849" offset="308809">Did you get -- you get (c)(2) at TELRIC rates?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="52.933" stopTime="198.279">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="52.933" offset="317168">--Yes, you do, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.401" offset="323020">You get (c)(2) and (c)(3) at TELRIC rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.020" offset="333469">And so the answer to the question presented is yes, for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.872" offset="352904">First, because the FCC says so and, as the expert agency charged with interpreting and implementing the act, that conclusion is entitled to deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.946" offset="393237">Second, the FCC's conclusion is consistent with the plain text of the statute and the implementing regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.433" offset="423121">And third, the FCC's conclusion is consistent with the policies embodied in the Act, because the practical result of affirming the Sixth Circuit opinion in this case is that a competitive carrier, like Sprint for example, will be forced to either charge its customers more for interconnection or lay tens of thousands of duplicate entrance facility cables, and those are precisely what the act were designed to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.067" offset="525730">I would like to start with the Sixth Circuit opinion, and specifically this is at page 20a of the Talk America cert petition appendix, because this goes to the heart of AT&amp;T's position and the Sixth Circuit's conclusion with respect to the orange plugs and cords analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.879" offset="596888">You will recall that the Sixth Circuit said this was like a situation where a homeowner had a plug in their garage and a long orange cord extending out to a park, which the Court called the entrance facility, and then the competitive carrier would be that person in the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.372" offset="654879">On page 20a of the petition appendix in footnote 9, about halfway down, this is the key flaw in the Sixth Circuit's reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.060" offset="689674">The Sixth Circuit says if you, as the homeowner, that's the -- I'm sorry, that's the incumbent -- had said that they may plug into the surge protector, then the big orange extension cord is just an entrance facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.785" offset="740561">But if you had said they must plug into the big orange extension cord, then the big orange extension cord becomes the interconnection facility; and consequently the parkgoers, the competitors, may plug into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.295" offset="790612">The problem with this is that the Sixth Circuit was wrong in that the incumbent doesn't get to choose where the point of connection is.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.799" offset="820600">The statute and the regulations and the FCC make clear it's the competitor that gets to choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.269" offset="842543">So if the competitor chooses the end of the extension cord where it connects to the CLEC network in the park, then even the Sixth Circuit agrees with us and the Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Circuits that the entrance facility is the interconnection facility.</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="213.289" offset="958527">Justice Kennedy, the answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.222" offset="966259">The statute gives the competitive carrier the opportunity to choose the point and the method, all at TELRIC rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.378" offset="998964">It -- it doesn't -- doesn't give free choice entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.064" offset="1021639">It says -- what are the words?</text>
            <text syncTime="232.683" offset="1036163">That the interconnection doesn't have to be put just anyplace if it's not feasible, or it's undue expense or something to that effect.</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="247.860" offset="1096871">Justice Ginsburg, the statute and the regulations make clear that it must be technically feasible, but there's an almost irrebuttable presumption that when there are already facilities in place performing that function, that is technically feasible.</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="260.186" stopTime="323.426">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="260.186" offset="1146190">But you -- you want the incumbent here to -- to build the -- the orange cord and extend it to wherever you have your switching equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.891" offset="1189031">And what they say is no; you -- you bring your switching equipment here; we'll -- we'll allow you to connect at, you know, the end of our facilities; but by God, you -- you make -- you make your own connection to -- to the switches.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.235" offset="1250367">Now -- now, moreover, you're -- you're making them -- you'll pay them for the orange cord, but only at TELRIC rates, which are not realistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.026" offset="1289550">Now, why -- why are they wrong and you're right, especially when you have legislation, the purpose of which was to encourage the independent building of new facilities?</text>
            <text syncTime="309.850" offset="1344825">I mean, it's clear that the Act wanted these new entrants where -- where possible to build new facilities, and not simply to glom on to the extant facilities of the incumbents.</text>

            <text syncTime="325.895" offset="1408982">First, this case is about existing facilities, not about facilities to be built, although there's a lot of talk about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.532" offset="1435523">This isn't a head-on challenge to the statute or the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.834" offset="1448793">The procedural posture is that this was AT&amp;T trying to get out of arbitration agreements that it had for existing entrance facilities, and so that's the posture of our case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="345.673" stopTime="352.843">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="345.673" offset="1488081">Well, but the logic of your case as you described it would also require AT&amp;T to build out the orange cord.</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="352.843" offset="1516816">Right; and -- and two additional points, Your Honor, on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.695" offset="1528205">First they say this is a large obligation because we're talking about miles and miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.515" offset="1547431">That is not the position that AT&amp;T took with the FCC when they were commenting on the TRRO.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.936" offset="1573136">At page 16a of the Michigan blue brief in footnote 357 of the TRRO the FCC acknowledges AT&amp;T's statement that entrance facilities involve very short distances.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.644" offset="1624022">In addition, we have the FCC's regulation and the local competition order, paragraph 553--</text>

            <text syncTime="396.370" offset="1690896">But if you ask for a longer distance they would presumably have to build it?</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="400.723" offset="1708345">And charge you TELRIC rates.</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="401.639" offset="1712003">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.006" offset="1713465">Because the FCC has promulgated in -- in 521, the meet-point obligation, which is another way that you can have interconnection.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.162" offset="1746066">And that demonstrates two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.829" offset="1752754">First, that sometimes AT&amp;T as the incumbent is required to build out facilities, that it's not just a passive obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.685" offset="1780130">But in addition, when they're talking about meet points, they say that it's up to State commissions to decide the appropriate and reasonable distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.104" offset="1809805">So even if we were presented with the case -- not this case, but a different case -- where you're talking about what's the appropriate length of the facilities, the FCC has already acknowledged there could be some reasonable limits on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.646" offset="1852019">And the most important fundamental point, the fourth point on this, is that Congress already in (c)(2) said you're going to have interconnection without regard to market impairment, and so we're not going to look at the availability of other entrance facilities in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.554" offset="1907608">If a competitor asks to have this location and this method and it's technically feasible, they do get the TELRIC rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.410" offset="1939059">And the competitive carriers would take issue with the presumption that TELRIC rates are -- are unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.813" offset="1964659">The regulations do contemplate that they're going to recover not only their cost but a reasonable profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.050" offset="1985661">And we can disagree about the congressional wisdom of requiring rates like that, but in the Verizon case this Court definitively put to bed the question of the reasonableness of the TELRIC rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="966.844" offset="3972848">There are a lot of statements by the FCC at issue in this case, but I would like to focus on two statements by the commission in its published regulation and orders that, taken together, resolve the question presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.466" offset="4015271">And the first is the commission's determination in 47 CFR 51.305(e), which appears at page 5a of Michigan's brief, that it is the competitor, not the incumbent, that gets to select the point at which interconnection takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.226" offset="4078279">Specifically, that regulation says that if an incumbent wants to deny a request for interconnection, it has -- at a particular point, it has the burden of proving that interconnection at that point would be technically infeasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.116" offset="4125926">And that undercuts a key premise of the decision below, which was that as long as the incumbent provides interconnection at some technically feasible point that it has selected then it's discharged its obligation, and if the competitor doesn't like it, that's just too bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.709" offset="4184231">They can build their own facility if they want to interconnect somewhere else.</text>

            <text syncTime="1022.945" offset="4197188">Counsel, underlying that question is an issue that I think Justices Ginsburg and Scalia were asking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.351" offset="4230834">Technically feasible is different from economically ridiculous or economically burdensome.</text>

            <text syncTime="1077.795" offset="4416616">Nonetheless, as the commission explained when it adopted those regulations in 1996 at paragraph 209 of the local competition order, competitors have an incentive to ask for an economically efficient means of interconnection, because they have to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.257" offset="4486416">I mean, the -- they don't pay as much as AT&amp;T would like -- they're paying TELRIC rates -- but they do still have to pay for interconnection, so they have incentive to ask for a reasonable method of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1775.495" offset="7207434">And what the agency says to the Eighth Circuit, which then deferred to this interpretation, is with section (c)(2) interconnection included routing and transmission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.620" offset="7247872">(C)(2) would overlap with other sections that, one, describe a duty to route and transmit traffic, telephone calls; and, two, a duty to lease facilities that will be used for routing and transmission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.611" offset="7299908">Footnote: Those duties are (b)(5) and (c)(3).</text>

            <text syncTime="1819.091" offset="7381828">And we know it doesn't arise under that section because these aren't things that are bottleneck elements, these aren't things that competitors can't get themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.723" offset="7476287">And so what the government is trying to do here is impose this leasing obligation under the interconnection duty in a way that never gave AT&amp;T and other incumbents any opportunity to challenge it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1870.124" offset="7585896">Back in the level competition order, Justice Sotomayor, when they adopted the TELRIC methodology, they recognized -- this is in paragraph 702 -- interconnection services -- that's what they called it back then -- are bottlenecks, not things that competitors can build themselves or buy from third parties in the marketplace, as the agency has found is the case since 2005.</text>

            <text syncTime="3268.155" offset="13178086">It's 47 CFR 51.321, and this goes directly to the points that Justice Sotomayor was making.</text>

            <text syncTime="3289.652" offset="13263976">Technically feasible methods -- this is in sub B -- include but are not limited to, and they give two examples: colocation and meet points.</text>

            <text syncTime="3305.446" offset="13327193">Assume you had a high school cafeteria and the school board said you have to provide vegetables to students when they ask for them, and you have to give them the vegetable that they ask for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.386" offset="13367003">Those include broccoli and green beans, and they don't say anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.456" offset="13387274">Then you have a separate obligation in (c)(3) and the school board says until we see that the kids have enough nutrition, you must give them peas, that's entrance facilities unbundled under (c)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.764" offset="13436489">So some time goes by and the school board says, okay, the kids are getting enough peas, we're going to wipe away that second restriction, but the initial restriction, the obligation in 321 is still there; and if a student asks for peas, it's within the scope of 321 because broccolis and green beans were representative examples, and peas are another one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3407.760" offset="13736479">--From the TRO and the TRRO, and the FCC discussed that distinction in the Sixth Circuit briefing at pages 6 to 7, so this isn't anything new, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.232" offset="13770334">So the fact that this is not something new is demonstrated conclusively by comments in the TRRO proceedings from Bell South which is now an AT&amp;T subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.206" offset="13818295">And Bell South says at page 59 of its comments, fully recognizing the obligation that went all the way back to 1996 in reg 321: Because entrance facilities may be required for interconnection purposes and Congress explicitly enacted provisions that govern carrier obligations to provide interconnection in 251(c)(2), it was altogether reasonable for the commission to exclude these network elements from a definition of ILEC dedicated transport intended for unbundled access under 251(c)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.927" offset="13945145">So even incumbent carriers knew what the FCC was doing in paragraph 140 of the TRRO and there was nothing new there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.683" offset="13976179">One other small point with respect to the network engineers map.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.135" offset="13989972">This entrance facility right here on page 19 already exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.122" offset="14017870">We're talking about existing facilities; and it's true, as the Sixth Circuit said, that if the point of interconnection is here at the ILEC switch, then that's where interconnection takes place, and this entrance facility is -- is truly providing transport, not interconnection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.216" offset="14074295">But when a competitive carrier chooses its own switch as the point of interconnection, this is the end of the AT&amp;T entrance facility, then interconnection takes place there, and even in the Sixth Circuit's view that entrance facility is interconnection under (c)(2), and as Congress has said, that's the obligation that is immutable because it is so important, fundamental to competition.</text>
