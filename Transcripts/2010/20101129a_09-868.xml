            <text syncTime="14.835" offset="165742">The issue before the Court today is whether a State court sentence reduction motion, which is a pure plea for leniency, qualifies as, quote,</text>

            <text syncTime="25.659" offset="209105">within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. section 2244(d)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="29.531" offset="224569">The State respectfully argue that there are at least three reasons why such a term as "collateral review" refers only to a legal challenge, refer to those recognized post-direct appeal applications in which constitutional, jurisdictional, and other such fundamental errors may be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.510" offset="300534">First, as this Court has said, it is presumed -- Congress is presumed to have known the language that this Court used in its decisions, and the term 2255 applications as those type of independent civil inquiries testing the validity of a conviction and/or sentence.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>

            <text syncTime="82.806" offset="437624">And certainly the Rule 25 -- 35 motion is post-conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.213" offset="463329">So it's post-conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.572" offset="472733">It's not direct review.</text>

            <text syncTime="125.182" offset="607211">Also, I think importantly, it would be anomalous in a tolling provision, in which we are talking about a direct appeal already having been concluded, to embrace things that don't -- that don't -- that come prior to the direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.787" offset="665621">This is a tolling -- obviously, 2244(d)(1) speaks about the finality of a State court judgment of conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.104" offset="742839">For example, it can be made within 120 days of the imposition of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.181" offset="763214">Or it can be made within 120 days after the affirmance of the conviction on direct appeal of the Rhode Island Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.302" offset="791636">So it can be made prior to when the conviction becomes, quote/unquote, "final".</text>

            <text syncTime="207.525" offset="936563">I think clearly we are all in agreement that post-conviction vehicles and habeas vehicles, which obviously all traditionally occur after the direct appeal has been concluded, obviously qualify as what this Court's -- and everybody, we would suggest -- recognize as, quote/unquote, "collateral review".</text>
            <text syncTime="223.704" offset="1001242">In terms of a Rule 35 motion that says, for example, the sentence is outside of the -- outside of the proper boundaries, it's unlawful as a matter of law, I don't think we've actually conceded before this Court that that would qualify.</text>
