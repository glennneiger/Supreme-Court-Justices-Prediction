            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">The first one, United States v. Tinklenberg involves the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, which requires that a criminal trial begins 70 days after the arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.745" offset="156359">It then list a long set of exclusions from that 70-day count, so you have to have seventy non-excludable days.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.253" offset="186452">Now, one of those exclusions -- is "a delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of such motions," so it says, don't suppose to exclude it, you get an extra plus the 70-days plus.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.953" offset="257191">In this case, the Court of Appeals from the Sixth Circuit found that the 3(d) Act of -- the Speedy Trial Act was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.702" offset="284254">There had more than seventy non-excludable days had passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.834" offset="300763">Hence, but in doing that, it counted, that means it didn't exclude several critical days following certain pretrial motions, and falling within the period "from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on or other prompt disposition of the motion".</text>
            <text syncTime="67.551" offset="375578">Now, the Circuit reasoned that the particular pretrial motions at issue did not cause a delay in the beginning of Tinklenberg's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.986" offset="409328">The trial began just for -- and it would've begun without the pretrial motions, and the Court said that matters because the statutory language excludes only "delay resulting from pretrial motions."</text>
            <text syncTime="90.181" offset="466171">If there is no delay at recent, there is no exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.685" offset="484143">In our view however, the words "delay resulting from" which are present at the beginning of almost every statutory phrase that announces an exclusion, do not require nor do they permit a judge to decide in each particular case whether a pretrial motion did, or did not in fact delay the beginning of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.388" offset="570974">Rather, Congress did the deciding here.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.537" offset="583617">It believed that the circumstances listed in the exclusion do normally cause delay, and it intended the periods of time specified in the exclusion before us following a pretrial motion to apply automatically, irrespective of whether the motion does or does not postpone the particular trial at issue in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.748" offset="668463">Now, we base that conclusion on the language of the statute, read in full context, and interpreted in light of its structure and purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.788" offset="704616">And we note that the Sixth Circuit's contrary interpretation would make the statute much more difficult for trial judges to administer.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.762" offset="736486">We also note that for the past several decades, all other circuits have interpreted the statute as we interpret it today.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.346" offset="770759">Now, we go on to decide another issue, even though the respondent Jason Tinklenberg losses his argument about excluding pretrial motion days, he wins an offsetting claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.439" offset="819137">He points out that the statute excludes days used to transport defendants to medical exams, but it says you can't exclude more than ten of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.258" offset="858425">But he will have more days spent transporting, and interpreting how many days in excess of ten were spent transporting Tinklenberg, days that were not excludable from the Speedy Trial Act 70-day count, add them on.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.657" offset="912029">The Court did not count weekend days and holidays.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.872" offset="928956">Well, I don't know why they didn't, we say.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.130" offset="941913">And we agree with Tinklenberg that those weekend days and holidays are not excludable and they should count as part of the seventy days non-excludable days which passed before he went to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.225" offset="986321">So Tinklenberg consequently wins his basic claim that the Speedy Trial Act was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.033" offset="1009518">We explain all these more thoroughly in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.360" offset="1022892">As I said, we disagree with two separate aspects of what the Court of Appeals decided, that those two determinations that we find erroneous in a sense, cancel each other out.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.612" offset="1063852">And we consequently affirm the Court of Appeals ultimate finding of the Speedy Trial Act violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.703" offset="1088199">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in which the Chief Justice and Justice Thomas have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.650" offset="1120068">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
