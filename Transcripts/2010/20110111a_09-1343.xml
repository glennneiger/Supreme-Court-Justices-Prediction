            <text syncTime="3481.261" offset="14029490">And the New Jersey Supreme Court said there was a suggestion that some trades could have been by consignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.665" offset="14051015">I believe that that is outside of this -- taken out of this case by an admission in the brief -- at least for this sale -- in the brief in our position to defendant's motion to dismiss at 1920 filed October 11th, 2006, where they state, where respondent states it was sold by us to MMA, and it was sold by MMA to Curcio Scrap Metal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.602" offset="14162819">So, there is no consignment, there is no consignment under 9102 which Ohio has adopted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3526.826" offset="14211720">The evidence in the record under 9102 which Ohio has adopted, I think can only be reasonably viewed -- and this Court obviously treats it as de novo, on a jurisdictional review -- can only be viewed as not a consignment because MMA was in the business of selling the products to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.156" offset="14293013">Let me say that for the -- there was no interaction in the record with anyone from New Jersey by MMA or by J. McIntyre.</text>
