            <text syncTime="11.589" offset="152785">This is a case in which the courts are being asked to perform a legislative and regulatory function in a matter in which the necessary balancing of contending policy interests is among the most complex, multifaceted, and consequential of any policy issue now before the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.000" offset="218405">The States ask that the courts assess liability and design a new common law remedy for contributing to climate change, and to do so by applying a general standard of reasonableness to determine for each defendant, in this case and in future cases, what, if any, its share of global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions ought to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.266" offset="307534">That would require the courts not to interpret and enforce the policy choices placed into law by the other branches, but to make those policy choices themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.352" offset="1047845">But -- but in this case it does seem to me that you're lacking any clear precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.689" offset="1073236">When I think of standing, I think of Frothingham v. Mellon.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.260" offset="1087446">But the Court has said in Warth v. Seldin that the plaintiff has to demonstrate that it will benefit in some tangible way from the Court's intervention.</text>

            <text syncTime="264.805" offset="1165709">So if you look at standing alone, it seems to me the States would have standing on the same basis that Massachusetts had standing.</text>

            <text syncTime="284.134" offset="1243032">The Court said that it was addressing standing to challenge the denial of a petition for rulemaking, when the agency would be proceeding incrementally to address a broader problem, and a statute specifically gave the petitioners the right to seek that kind of incremental protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.911" offset="1306039">The Court was very specific about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.478" offset="1312308">The statutory right was of critical importance, it said, to the standing inquiry.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="305.048" offset="1326623">Mr. Keisler, the Court did say that, but it's cut off from the Court's actual analysis in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.833" offset="1345745">When the Court goes through injury and causation and redressability, the Court never refers to the statutory cause of action.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter D. Keisler</label>
            <text syncTime="317.272" offset="1375525">But it does, Justice Kagan, specifically refer to the regulatory context in which the case is taking place.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.426" offset="1396109">The Court said that if the EPA's arguments there about traceability and redressability were adopted, it would doom most challenges to agency action because agencies proceed incrementally.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.799" offset="1437592">Here we have no statute, we have no agency proceeding incrementally, and we believe there is no basis for the plaintiffs to seek that kind of incremental relief when they've acknowledged that will have no material effect on their injury; and they acknowledged that in the State's complaint when they specifically said that the relief they seek here would only constitute these defendants' share of the larger overall emissions reductions that would be necessary in order to have any material effect on climate change or the injuries that they assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.718" offset="1557337">That is an acknowledgment that the relief they seek here would not provide them any redress except in connection with other reductions that would be obtained elsewhere, and that we think means that this is a classic case in which the injuries are not the product of the defendants' conduct but of the collective independent actions of numerous third parties not before the Court.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="381.548" offset="1632674">But the Court clearly understood that in Massachusetts v. EPA and said that it was enough, and I would think under traditional standing principles the standing there was actually harder to find because one had to go through the EPA first.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.189" offset="1687218">One had to say the EPA should regulate, and then the EPA would regulate, and then the question was would that reduce emissions levels?</text>
            <text syncTime="404.811" offset="1725670">Here the EPA is out of the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.763" offset="1733507">The action is much more direct.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter D. Keisler</label>
            <text syncTime="408.199" offset="1739254">But there, Your Honor, they were suing a defendant, the EPA, that had regulatory authority over the entire country.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.234" offset="1759420">Here they're suing five separate defendants, each of whom has to be evaluated individually, and there is not a single one of them against whom the relief sought would have any tangible effect on the injuries that the plaintiffs claim here.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.161" offset="1811038">But we also think that Massachusetts is relevant in a completely different respect, which is the Court was very specific in Massachusetts about what its role was and what it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.932" offset="1846147">The Court said: We lack the expertise or the authority to second-guess the policy choices of the EPA, but its role there was to compel the agency to adhere to the statute as the Court interpreted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.257" offset="1895466">In this case, the States are asking the courts to play exactly the role that this Court disclaimed in Massachusetts v. EPA, which is to make those policy choices in the first instance, and they say that the courts can do this because the courts have done this in prior nuisance cases, but this case is nothing like any of the prior nuisance cases this Court has held.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.488" offset="1976445">It's nothing like an instance in which one State is complaining that another State has dumped sewage into a body of water that's crossed the border.</text>

            <text syncTime="1931.478" offset="7832367">First is, EPA is currently regulating existing sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.614" offset="7848876">To the extent that a power plant is modified in any way to increase carbon dioxide above a certain amount -- and this is one of the so-called tailoring rules -- then those power plants right now are subject to regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1951.406" offset="7912093">These regulations just went into effect in January 2011 for existing power plants that seek to modify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.962" offset="7938320">Second, there is a settlement agreement in place that commits EPA by May of 2012 to deciding how and whether to regulate existing power sources, the existing stationary sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.937" offset="7994222">And third, and I think most fundamentally, there is no precedent, Justice Ginsburg, that says that the government must regulate the specific industry, the specific thing that the plaintiff isolates, in order for displacement to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.279" offset="8047512">Rather, Sea Clammers and Milwaukee II I think make explicit that that's the wrong question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.266" offset="8071544">And so long as the nuisance is being addressed -- and here the nuisance is undoubtedly being addressed with a panoply of different Federal actions in the area of global warming, and an executive order that says that fighting global warming is one of the government's highest priorities -- and concrete steps taken, such as the 500-page tailoring rule, the 400-page -- the -- the other hundreds of pages that EPA has done with its experts to appropriately regulate greenhouse gas emissions, as opposed to a Federal common law court of action doing something which would frankly put you all at sea in terms of the complexity, economics, international nature of the problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2154.270" offset="8723560">This case rests on the longstanding fundamental authority of the States to protect their land, their natural resources, and their citizens from air pollution emitted in other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.744" offset="8769432">It rests on three propositions: One, the interests of the States are harmed by global warming; two, these defendants, as the five largest U.S. emitters of carbon dioxide, are significant contributors to it; and, three, these defendants could take reasonable, cost-effective measures to reduce their emissions in a way that would slow the effects of global warming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.575" offset="8856785">We will have to prove these propositions, and after we do the district court will have to determine whether it can frame an appropriate equitable injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2199.882" offset="8906000">But this Court should not close the courthouse door to this case at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.203" offset="8923240">The common law action for public nuisance has been around for hundreds of years, has been adapted by courts to cover new environmental threats, and there's no reason why the courts can't do the same thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.392" offset="8967962">The defendants say there are too many plaintiffs, too many potential defendants, and that adjudication of this case will require courts to solve the entire problem of global warming, but that is simply not so.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter D. Keisler</label>
            <text syncTime="4419.313" offset="17783662">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4420.879" offset="17789931">Just a few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4421.848" offset="17793797">First, with respect to the merits and what it would involve to adjudicate this case, Justice Kagan, it is a -- there's a reason that this issue is so fraught and difficult in international negotiations and at the EPA and in the halls of Congress, and that's because it requires policymakers to allocate burdens among critical social goods in favor of important environmental considerations; and the remedies that are being considered are potentially transformative because they involve the way we use and supply and pay for energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4453.534" offset="17920543">And the problems with courts attempting to replicate what's going on in those venues are not simply the matter is complex, although of course it's extremely complex, but there is no legal principle here to guide the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.544" offset="17968609">It's a question of trade-offs, how the country wants to balance the projected environmental risks and benefits against the projected economic benefits and costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.900" offset="18006016">If Congress enacts a statute providing a standard, then our political question argument goes away.</text>
            <text syncTime="4480.102" offset="18026809">It's not that this is permanently off limits to the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4483.220" offset="18039348">It's that it requires a standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.806" offset="18045618">And in a big intractable issue like this, Congress can often create an orderly framework for consideration within a statutory context, which it has done in part by enacting the Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4495.146" offset="18086996">And the final point I would make my friend and I come at this really from opposite angles, in the following sense, which is the plaintiffs say that this is a deeply historically rooted cause of action with a very strong and ancient pedigree, and therefore it can't possibly present justiciability problems, under standing, political question doctrines; and we say that the very powerful standing and political question obstacles that we think are apparent on the face of this are a signal that this is nothing like the historical cause of action that they've relied on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.118" offset="18222937">To classify climate change as a tort would trigger a massive shift of institutional authority away from the politically accountable branches and to the courts, which we think would be inconsistent with separation of powers, and for those reasons we ask that the Court reverse the judgment and direct that the case be dismissed.</text>
