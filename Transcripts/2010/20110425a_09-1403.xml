            <text syncTime="501.853" offset="2111801">But as this Court indicated in Basic, and just last month in Matrixx, loss causation and reliance are two distinct elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.024" offset="2144507">And the reason that's important in this particular context is that reliance can create a situation where you have individualized issues predominating over common issues.</text>

            <label>Ms. Nicole A. Saharsky</label>
            <text syncTime="939.037" offset="3860543">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="942.405" offset="3874022">The Fifth Circuit erred in requiring proof of loss causation at class certification for three reasons: First, it's conducting a merits inquiry that's not tethered to the Rule 23 requirements; second, it's taking a presumption and requiring plaintiffs to prove it; and third, it's confusing the distinct elements of reliance and loss causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.568" offset="3950717">Just to start in with some of the Court's questions: First, Justice Scalia's: Does the court require proof of loss causation?</text>
            <text syncTime="967.139" offset="3972974">The Fifth Circuit could not be more clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.989" offset="3980392">It is not talking about rebutting the presumption of reliance, giving the defendants an opportunity to do that at class certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.210" offset="4005261">It is putting an affirmative burden on plaintiffs that they have to meet in every single case, even if the defendants do not come to court with any evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.649" offset="4035041">And that is a very heavy burden, as the district court in this case realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.684" offset="4051132">And just to make this as concrete as possible, loss causation is the question at the end of the day, whether the price decline that caused the losses was sufficiently related to the earlier alleged material misstatement and whether there was any other cause that could have led to the price decline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.597" offset="4126783">So if a plaintiff cannot come in and prove loss causation, there could be many reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.085" offset="4152696">It may be because the market is not efficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.703" offset="4163250">It could also be because there's no material misstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.655" offset="4175057">But it could also be, as this Court recognized in Dura, that there was a material misstatement, it did inflate the stock price, but then other causes such as a bad economy or other news about the company came along, and that's what caused the stock price to drop.</text>

            <text syncTime="1033.464" offset="4238273">But you acknowledged that if the cause was the fact that the market was not efficient, that could be raised at the certification stage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1043.889" offset="4279965">--Well, that's certainly what the Court suggested in Basic and what the courts of appeals have done, is to say that that's a threshold showing that is sufficiently collateral to the merits that it needs to be made, so that the presumption can be invoked in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.780" offset="4331478">But these ideas about rebutting the presumption by showing that at the end of the day the plaintiff can't prove its case, these are things, as Mr. Boies said, that stand or fall on a class-wide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.303" offset="4373588">And the real problem with the Fifth Circuit's decision is that it did not tie its proof of loss causation to the requirements of Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.658" offset="4407024">Everyone agrees here that loss causation stands or falls on a class-wide basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1121.056" offset="4588628">There are heightened pleading requirements that apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.322" offset="4597718">There are plaintiffs that will lose at summary judgment on the issue of loss causation, for example, because, A, either they don't allege a price drop, B, they don't connect the price drop to the earlier distortion of the market when there's a material misstatement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3078.810" offset="12419615">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.843" offset="12423795">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.595" offset="12430796">Let me respond to Mr. Sterling's statement that all we had to do was show one statistically significant price movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.867" offset="12467890">As the Court is aware from the briefing, on December 7th of 2001, the Halliburton put out a release that indicated that their prior statements that their asbestos reserves were -- were adequate were not -- were not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.912" offset="12536017">The stock dropped 42 percent, more than 42 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.614" offset="12554825">The actual drop was 42.4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.249" offset="12569349">Expert witnesses calculated that the company's specific drop was slightly larger than that because the market was generally going up that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.456" offset="12610205">But it was a dramatic drop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.075" offset="12620654">Their own expert, as is indicated in the briefing, agreed that there wasn't anything else happening that day other than asbestos news, and so--</text>

            <text syncTime="3140.966" offset="12668301">So you win, so you win at the certification stage or at the pleading stage, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.620" offset="12690871">So why is it such I big deal to you here?</text>

            <label>Mr. David Boies</label>
            <text syncTime="3149.156" offset="12701006">--Because under the -- the Fifth Circuit rule, I understand that counsel disavows the actual language of the Fifth Circuit rule, but it was that language that the district court relied on in failing to certify the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.797" offset="12755550">And with -- with -- with respect to the Fifth Circuit test, what the Fifth Circuit says is that because the announcement on December 7th did not specifically reference the prior announcements, it cannot be considered a correction of those prior announcements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.259" offset="12837470">Indeed, the court, the Fifth Circuit goes even further, and this is at page 338 of the F. Supp. opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.530" offset="12866518">It says, quote: The district court must decide whether the corrective disclosure more probably than not shows that the original estimates or predictions were designed to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.105" offset="12916778">So what the Fifth Circuit is doing is it's bringing, even the defrauding aspect, not just the falsity aspect, but the defrauding aspect right into the class certification stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.015" offset="12968500">And I think Justice Scalia's question was exactly on point with respect to discovery, because either they're going to make these merits decisions without discovery or you're going to have all of the discovery before you have the class certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.643" offset="13038926">It's got to be one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.593" offset="13046763">And in either case what is happening is you're converting what Rule 23 says is an issue as to whether common issues predominate into an issue as to what is the strength of the merits claim that the plaintiff has, and while it is true, reliance is part of the merits claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.092" offset="13140804">The reason reliance is different is because reliance, if it -- if there is no reliance, if there's no efficient market, then reliance can make individual issues predominate, but when the only issue is not a step issue like efficient market, but is a direct merits issue, there isn't any way that you can make individual issues predominate regardless of how you decide it; and loss causation and price distortion are both those kind of common issues; and counsel says he doesn't defend the -- the actual loss causation statements of the -- of the -- of the Fifth Circuit, and what I would ask is whether the Court, if the Court does decide to send it back, that the Court look at what the right standard is for the court below to be applying when it deals with class certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.867" offset="13403909">And I would urge the Court that when you have pleadings, summary judgment, and trial tests for merits questions, then you don't need another merits test on -- at the class certification stage, even if Rule 23 permitted it, which we don't think it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.365" offset="13485829">What Rule 23 is designed to do is simply say are individual issues or common issues going to predominate?</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.053" offset="13516654">And all of the class have the same loss causation, have the same price distortion issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.242" offset="13553330">If the Court has no more questions, that completes my argument.</text>
