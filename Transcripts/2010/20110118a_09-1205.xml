            <text syncTime="11.706" offset="152283">Petitioners Keith Smith and Shirley Sperlazza were not named plaintiffs in the prior Federal proceeding litigated by George McCollins.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.962" offset="185302">They never received notice of that prior proceeding; they never received an opportunity to appear and be heard; they never received an opportunity to opt out; and they never received an opportunity to appeal the decision denied by certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.673" offset="252071">No precedent of this Court would justify treating -- treating people as parties under preclusion principles under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.349" offset="306824">Recently in Taylor v. Sturgell this Court addressed the rule against nonparty preclusion and discussed the recognized exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.622" offset="343918">The Court in that case discussed a properly conducted class action as being one of the exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.525" offset="367532">The Court in discussing these preclusion rules noted that they are limited by due process concerns, and the Court noted that the properly conducted class action is an exception due to the due process protections incorporated into Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.952" offset="425211">Obviously, this Court has discussed the due process protections with class actions in prior cases, particularly those dealing with 23(b)(3) classes in cases such as Eisen and Shutts.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.097" offset="497831">The Court has noted that whenever a class is certified notice must be provided; the right to -- notice must be provided; they must have the right to appear and be heard in person or by counsel; they must have the right to opt out as well as protection of adequate representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="202.440" offset="915163">And certainly the district courts in West Virginia would look to other district courts' opinions and would likely render them persuasive, or consider them persuasive, under those circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.363" offset="1058837">Interestingly, in Taylor, this Court noted that adopting a broad theory of virtual representation based upon an identity of interests, adequate representation, and a close relationship would -- would, in essence, be equivalent to adopting a de facto class action or recognizing a common law class action without any of the procedural due process protections provided by Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.281" offset="1170536">Obviously, in dealing with these cases, the main reason a certification is -- the main reason the due process protections are provided upon certification is to go ahead and justify binding the class members to any judgment issued by the court at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.242" offset="1242425">Until you have that, unless you have the certification and the due process protections for a Rule 23(b)(3) class, until you have those, the absent class members remain strangers to the proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.745" offset="1356424">We submit, however, that any procedural rights which have been recognized and adopted, those procedural rights, just as the substantive claim, itself, have to be adjudicated consistent with due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.887" offset="1408982">And West Virginia itself has adopted Rule 23 of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure, and that State has the right to apply and interpret that rule as it sees fit to manage its own docket and administrate its own docket as it sees fit.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.222" offset="1530295">All of the issues raised in our petition for cert remain just as they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.226" offset="1554328">At worst, if White v. Wyatt withstands petition for rehearing, at worst we lose our CCPA claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.582" offset="1587764">That certainly is a valuable claim to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.665" offset="1596123">I will not dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.867" offset="1600930">But we also have a common law fraud claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.200" offset="1610230">We also have breach of warranty claims, and those are still in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.104" offset="1625799">And the critical fact of this case in that regard is, the question of whether or not a class may be certified under West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure has never been litigated, has never been decided by any court.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.557" offset="1743663">Your Honor, I believe it would depend upon whether or not that State has said that not only are we going to look at these Federal decisions as being persuasive, but we're going to consider ourself bound by the decisions of the Fourth Circuit or the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.023" offset="1853482">Is it then up to the courts to actually try to determine whether the -- the West Virginia court in this case would have gone along, would have interpreted its own rule of civil procedure the same way that the Federal Court interpreted the Federal rule?</text>

            <text syncTime="459.621" offset="1943865">I mean, they will -- they will consider them to be persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.723" offset="1956300">They will consider them -- but in their In re Rezulin case, the court noted -- the court actually criticized the circuit judge for relying exclusively on Federal decisions denying class certification in medical device or prescription drug cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.398" offset="2011052">And the court noted that, you know, although we will look at those rules and they may be persuasive, they are not binding or controlling on us, and that is because we do not want our legal analysis to be nothing more than a mere Pavlovian response to Federal decisional rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="513.771" offset="2160473">They cite Neuberger on Class Actions as one of the authorities to support this principle, but they note that in -- in our court that normally challenges based upon reliance, causation, and damages will not bar certification on a predominance basis, because those go to the right of the individual to recover, but not to the overall liability issues of the defendant, which it believes can be addressed as common issues in many cases and save the court an extreme amount of time addressing those common issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="1376.563" offset="5611666">And this Court has heightened the standard in those class -- class settlement certifications for the court to make sure that each and every element and requirement is met, to ensure that -- that the settlement itself is fair to all class members, including the absent class members, and that, you know -- and that the attorney fees are fair.</text>

            <text syncTime="1638.570" offset="6659699">The issue that was decided and preclusive was the issue of predominance, Your Honor, and what happened there is that Judge Davis, the judge who was supervising the multidistrict litigation, he made a determination under West Virginia law as to what's required to make out an economic loss claim, and he concluded that what is required is individual proof of injury as well as individual proof of causation, and then he went on to describe what kind of evidence would be necessary to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.880" offset="6820927">So he made a legal determination, and then he went -- and then after looking at what kind of evidence would be required -- excuse me -- made a, I think a mixed law and fact determination that given that, individual issues would predominate over common issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.191" offset="6898145">His -- his interpretation of West Virginia law was later vindicated by the West Virginia Supreme Court in White, where they held that -- that there is a requirement of individual proof of injury, which had been contested by Petitioners, and it's clear that it's going to require the same exact kind of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.688" offset="6984140">So what we have is that there's no suggestion in Rezulin or anywhere else that the predominance requirement under the West Virginia version of Rule 23, which is essentially identical to the Federal version, has any other content that's different from the Federal version.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.418" offset="7059059">In Rezulin there's a suggestion that when -- that the West Virginia courts would treat differences in -- in damages or reliance as less significant than some Federal courts, but nothing at all that suggests in any way that if the underlying cause of action requires individual proof of injury and causation, that somehow that common questions are going to predominate over individual questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1979.417" offset="8023082">I think that, actually, Judge Davis took into account the difference in tone, and he looked very carefully at Rezulin, and he said that what Rezulin was focusing on was individual questions of damages, which defendants often argue is enough so that individual questions predominate, individual questions of reliance, which we also often argue mean that individual questions predominate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.667" offset="8132065">But he said this is different, because this is, in order to prove liability, they've got to establish individual injury, which means, on a person-by-person basis, either that they were harmed by the drug or that the drug didn't work to lower their cholesterol as -- as it was supposed to, and they have to show that whatever the violation of the Consumer Fraud Act was is causally linked there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.003" offset="8249407">And he said that's a different animal from questions of reliance and damages, and -- and I've heard or read no conceivable explanation about how, under any standard of predominance, you could have common questions predominating when every single member of the class is going to have to examine the medical records to see whether their cholesterol came down, whether they suffered any side effects, and -- and if their cholesterol didn't come down and they did suffer side effects, how that could be linked to a violation of the Consumer Fraud Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.711" offset="8400290">So what Judge -- Judge Davis didn't depart from Rezulin at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.329" offset="8414710">Judge Davis said this goes to core questions of liability, and as I interpret the West Virginia statute, in order to establish liability, they're going to have to show that on an individual-by-individual basis, and the relevance of White is that he's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.724" offset="8488270">Of course, White even goes further and says because of that there's no cause of action under the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2201.124" offset="8909887">But what was used here was quite a heavy gun, and that is the -- an empty suit injunction, which seems to say: We're not going to trust the West Virginia court to apply issue preclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2246.303" offset="9090654">So maybe you could be right about preclusion but wrong about use of the anti-suit injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2287.213" offset="9254285">Here's a reason why it's very important in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.182" offset="9270168">Under their theory, they -- they could not only file a class action in one county in West Virginia, and then if we couldn't get an injunction but we pled preclusion, and if -- and if we prevailed, they could file one in another county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.714" offset="9360238">And in West Virginia, county judges don't look to judges from other counties of stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.268" offset="9386465">And so they could go, under their approach, to another county, and that judge might agree with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.807" offset="9416662">And then they go to another county, and eventually they're pretty confident that they would find one judge in one county in West Virginia who would reject our preclusion analysis and allow the case to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.615" offset="9467862">And in West Virginia, we have no right to have an appeal heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.769" offset="9488447">There is no intermediate appellate court, and there's no appeal of right to the West Virginia Supreme Court.</text>
