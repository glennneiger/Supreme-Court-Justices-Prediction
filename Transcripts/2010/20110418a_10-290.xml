            <text syncTime="16.526" offset="171510">The Federal Circuit's clear and convincing evidence standard ensures the enforcement of invalid patents, even though this Court recognized in KSR that invalid patents stifle rather than promote the progress of liberal arts.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.102" offset="233785">Under this Court's decisions in Grogan and Huddleston, the default preponderance standard should govern in all cases because section 282 does not specify a heightened standard of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.474" offset="279343">And as this Court suggested in KSR, it makes no sense to have a heightened standard of proof when the relevant prior art evidence was never even considered by PTO.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.849" offset="320825">Under any view, it was error to require clear and convincing proof of invalidity in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="77.495" offset="415389">Are you going to argue for all the time, in which case, you can appeal to the general rule that we always apply, or are you going to say, oh, yes, we won't apply it normally but only when the prior art hadn't been considered?</text>
            <text syncTime="92.271" offset="474530">I mean, you -- you can't ride both horses.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Hungar</label>
            <text syncTime="96.259" offset="490412">--Your Honor, our position and our view of the correct interpretation of the statute is that Grogan and Huddleston approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.329" offset="518729">The statute does not specify a heightened standard; therefore, preponderance, the default standard; applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.732" offset="540359">I was attempting to answer Justice Ginsburg's question about the RCA case.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.386" offset="558958">And the RCA case didn't address the question that was discussed in KSR, but we believe, as I said, that the -- that the preponderance standard should govern across the board.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Hungar</label>
            <text syncTime="124.576" offset="603679">To the extent that -- that Justice Cardozo was discussing a heightened standard in the limited context of priority inventions, we think that that's not consistent with section 282, which, of course, came later.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.002" offset="653416">Moreover, I would note that the concerns that undergirded the Court's heightened standard in priority of invention cases, where -- those concerns were addressed to the -- the problem of primarily oral testimony being offered to substantiate priority of invention claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.011" offset="721439">The Federal Circuit has separately addressed that issue by means of its corroboration requirement, which operates separate and independent of the clear and convincing evidence standard, so the concerns that undergirded RCA are -- are completely taken care of by that as well.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="169.973" stopTime="183.865">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="169.973" offset="785283">But Justice Cardozo certainly didn't limit his holding in the way you suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.842" offset="800747">The language of that opinion is extremely broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.794" offset="812554">And if you read that opinion, no one would gather from that opinion the kinds of limits that you're suggesting on it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_g_hungar" startTime="183.865" stopTime="237.515">
            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Hungar</label>
            <text syncTime="183.865" offset="840871">Actually, Your Honor, I agree that there is some grand language used in dictum in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.553" offset="871591">Certainly, the holding doesn't extend beyond the -- what was presented before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.505" offset="887474">But, actually, if you read the language carefully, you'll see again and again he refers to the fact that it's a question of -- of prior invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.659" offset="916104">He says when the defense is a prior invention, and then he quotes the heightened standard on page 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.979" offset="933345">Again, on page 8, he talks about the defense of invention by another.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.015" offset="949436">So he -- and every single one of the cases that he cites there, without exception in that discussion on pages 7 to 8, is a priority of invention case, The Barbed Wire Patent case being the leading example which had explained this rationale for a heightened concern in that specific context.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.190" offset="1006174">But you don't have cases applying -- Supreme Court cases applying the heightened standard in other contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.011" offset="1029475">And, indeed, you have many cases decided after RCA that don't mention any heightened standard in viewing invalidity questions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="237.515" stopTime="268.184">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="237.515" offset="1055493">But just taking RCA itself, Cardozo said through all the verbal variances there runs this common core of thought and truth, that one otherwise an infringer who assails the validity of a patent bears -- upon its face, bears a heavy burden of persuasion and fails unless his evidence has more than a dubious preponderance.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_g_hungar" startTime="268.184" stopTime="298.988">
            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Hungar</label>
            <text syncTime="268.184" offset="1178164">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.736" offset="1180359">And read -- taken out of context, that could have broad implications, but the sentences before and after clearly make -- indicate that he's talking about priority of invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.957" offset="1213273">He talks about the title of the true inventor and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.709" offset="1224244">So -- so, again, that's what those cases said, and that's what a fair reading of RCA says.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.979" offset="1245351">But, regardless of the best reading of RCA, we -- the -- the question here is what did Congress do in 1952?</text>
            <text syncTime="291.467" offset="1271265">And we know that Congress in 1952 could not possibly have understood the law to be an across-the-board clear and convincing evidence standard.</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="298.988" stopTime="305.642">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="298.988" offset="1301358">Then you -- then you have to be saying that Judge Rich got it wrong because he does deal with the--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_g_hungar" startTime="305.642" stopTime="362.745">
            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Hungar</label>
            <text syncTime="305.642" offset="1328003">Well, certainly -- yes, Your Honor, certainly we think American Hoist is wrong, although I would note that Judge Rich, in his American Hoist decision, says that the cases prior to 1952 were all over the map.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.914" offset="1373038">But -- but the relevant question is what would Congress have thought the state of the law was in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.735" offset="1392368">If you think that there's any merit at all to the judicial codification argument, it's perfectly clear that Congress could not have thought in 1952 that the law was an across-the-board heightened standard, because case after case after case rejected the proposition that there is a heightened standard or that the presumption was unaffected when the evidence was not considered by the Patent Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.898" offset="1473034">The -- we've cited numerous cases in our brief at pages 34 through 36.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.969" offset="1493305">The -- and we also in the reply brief at footnote 3 reference a list of over 200 cases, some from before 1952 and some from after 1952, all recognizing that the presumption of validity was weakened or eliminated when the prior art evidence was not considered by the Patent Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.312" offset="1554641">So, you just--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="362.745" stopTime="387.927">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="362.745" offset="1556417">Well, Mr. Hungar, it seems to me that RCA would matter, even under your view of the world, because if you think that Congress did not codify the existing state of the law as to the standard of proof and you think that Congress -- that -- that section 282 was essentially silent as to the standard of proof, then the question is, what do we do?</text>
            <text syncTime="382.975" offset="1637292">And one answer to that question is we go with our prior precedent, which is RCA.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_g_hungar" startTime="387.927" stopTime="460.171">
            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Hungar</label>
            <text syncTime="387.927" offset="1657145">--Well, first of all, again, because RCA in context was a case where there was a priority of invention dispute that had been adjudicated in the Patent Office on the same evidence previously resolved by the Court, a priority of invention dispute, where the heightened standard cases had some application, it clearly wouldn't affect the standards in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.905" offset="1737080">But, more fundamentally, that's not what Congress thought in 1952, and when you don't have a clear rule to be codified, the default rules of statutory construction apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.344" offset="1774801">The default rule of statutory construction in a -- on this question, in Grogan and Huddleston, the preponderance standard applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.831" offset="1796744">And, moreover, while the statute does not specify a heightened standard, it does actually speak to and -- and preclude the argument that i4i makes, because the first sentence refers to patents being presumed valid under this Court's precedent, a presumption shifts the burden of going forward, and the second sentence of the original statute refers to the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.078" offset="1885769">Under their interpretation, presumption does all the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.863" offset="1896845">The first sentence not only shifts the burden of going forward, also shifts the burden of proof, and does so under a heightened standard, which has never been how presumption is interpreted generally in the law, and it renders the second sentence entirely superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.588" offset="1943761">There's no need for it.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="460.171" offset="1946060">--It's -- it -- it is true that the Federal Circuit has been consistent now since almost the beginning, since that court came on the scene, and it does have a monopoly on appeal in patent cases since 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.251" offset="2026412">Because the -- the Federal Circuit has consistently taken this position, one would have expected that there would have been bills proposed to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.094" offset="2085763">Were there any?</text>

            <text syncTime="498.713" offset="2100287">But I would note that this is, I think, i4i's congressional acquiescence argument, if you will, and that argument fails for numerous reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.569" offset="2135709">First of all, if there could be any acquiescence, and we don't think that the -- this Court's extremely high requirements for such a claim have been satisfied here, but if there could be any acquiescence at all, the first 30 years after enactment of the statute would be the most relevant consideration in determining what Congress had acquiesced in, and it's perfectly clear that the regional circuits all rejected the across-the-board heightened standard that i4i is arguing for.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.136" offset="2233929">So if Congress acquiesced in anything, it was not an across-the-board heightened standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="725.891" offset="3009034">I'll assume that the language is open enough in the history so that we could make what would be a change, I think it would be a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.866" offset="3056891">The reasons as I get from the brief for doing that are because there are two types of errors: It's a bad thing not to give protection to an invention that deserves it; and it is just as bad a thing to give protection to an invention that doesn't deserve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.744" offset="3124391">Both can seriously harm the economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.112" offset="3137870">And you are also saying that the Patent Office is out of control, not through its own fault, but there are too few people and too many inventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.587" offset="3179771">And therefore type two error is a real risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.539" offset="3191578">So I'm turning you to and say: Well, what should we do about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="774.907" offset="3205057">I know your proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.359" offset="3214879">But we have also seen in these briefs the following proposal: One, somebody who thinks there is a type two error, go back to the Patent Office and ask for reconsideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="790.867" offset="3268901">We get the experts to look at it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.786" offset="3276528">And then that's coupled with: Tell the district judges to stick very closely to their job, allow the clear and convincing standard to apply to facts, and by that we mean brute facts, and let them decide the brute facts, but let the judge decide whether that amounts to obviousness, novelty, or any of the other prerequisites.</text>

            <text syncTime="844.018" offset="3481537">First of all, with respect to re-exam, re-exam is not a solution to the problem or an answer to the absence of justification for a heightened standard, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.276" offset="3526572">First of all, re-exam is limited in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.411" offset="3539111">It can only consider certain types of prior art evidence and issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.465" offset="3555307">It couldn't, for example -- it was not available for the issue that we're talking about here, the on-sale bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.351" offset="3574847">There are various issues, the section 112 issues, such as written description and best mode and the like, are not susceptible of re-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.023" offset="3609537">Statutory subject matter is not susceptible of re-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.475" offset="3623330">Many kinds of prior art, anything other than actual patents or publications, cannot be referenced in the examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.247" offset="3650393">So it is a limited mode of inquiry that does not address many types of prior art that come up in many types of important cases, technology cases in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.186" offset="3694174">So that's one reason why the re-exam solution is not a problem, and of course it can't possibly be used to infer some intent on the part of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.042" offset="3729596">I4i and the government try to suggest that this was part of the scheme of Congress and this is why clear and convincing makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.946" offset="3757181">But re-exam was enacted in 1980, long after the '52 act, so it doesn't shed light on Congress's intent in enacting section 282.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.266" offset="3786439">And it was enacted before the Federal Circuit had created its heightened standard, so it can't possibly have been an attempt to address the problems created by an across-the-board heightened standard that did not exist at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.692" offset="3836176">In 1980 the law was clear that a preponderance standard governed in most or all cases and a preponderance standard, of course, governs in re-exam as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1229.732" offset="5024329">Certainly there are circumstances in which the party with the ultimate burden of proof does not bear -- does not have the burden of persuasion at every stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.955" offset="5053273">And Congress -- there were also cases prior to 1952 suggesting that the presumption had gone away, that there was no longer a presumption of validity or that the presumption went the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.578" offset="5095696">And so again, Congress wanted to be clear; it was saying there is a presumption which shifts the burden of going forward under this Court's precedence, and there is a burden of proof on the defendant, and that's all it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.035" offset="5145537">To infer that it did something much more, much more than the pre-1952 cases authorized -- there are literally dozens of pre-1952 cases cited in that list of 200 cases referenced at footnote 3 of our brief, from prior to 1952, rejecting the notion that there's an across-the-board heightened presumption of validity; saying, no, if the evidence was not considered by the Patent Office or in some -- the Western Auto case, for example, from the Sixth Circuit says well, there's this -- the exception for oral testimony of prior invention, that's the RCA case; but everything else is preponderance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.459" offset="5279284">So there's no -- there's no heightened presumption of validity in any other circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.993" offset="5297361">So I think the law was clear, and the treatises we cite at page 9 of our reply brief also make clear the treatise writers understood, there was no across-the-board heightened presumption that it was weakened or eliminated when the evidence was not before the Patent Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.622" offset="5363921">And some of the cases said -- actually RCA itself cites with approval two court of appeals cases that we note in our reply brief, the Studie case and the Wilson case, which rejected the notion of a heightened standard across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.465" offset="5419301">They said well, that's true when the issue was adjudicated before the Patent Office, but here where the Patent Office did not adjudicate the issue that doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.369" offset="5446886">So again you just can't get out of the pre-1952 case law -- the rule that i4i is urging.</text>

            <text syncTime="2312.170" offset="9354073">Number one, an infringer's validity challenge is a collateral attack on a government decision that has already been made, quite unlike Grogan and Huddleston, that bestows property rights by written instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.631" offset="9419901">Number two, the harm from an erroneous determination is hugely asymmetrical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.987" offset="9453338">A single holding of invalidity by a single lay jury vitiates for all time the patent and all of the reliance interest by the inventor and the investors and the licensees who have relied upon that ex ante.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.532" offset="9523555">Third, this grant of property rights not only induces reliance, which lack, like the land patent cases induce reliance, this is a grant of a property right that under the Constitution is specifically designed to induce reliance in exchange for the inventor's honoring her half of the patent bargain, that is public disclosure of her intellectual property for the public benefit, and the commitment of capital by investors and licensees that's necessary to bring into fruition for the public benefit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2407.500" offset="9735461">Re-examine is often invoked by the patent holder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.285" offset="9750612">That is, because re-exam is done by the expert agency and allows the patent -- allows the agency not to have a binary choice of yes, the patent's fine or no, it's invalid for all time, but can narrow the scope of the patent in re-exam, many re-exams are requested by the patent holder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.199" offset="9838174">And more -- and also, when you request re-examination or when the PTO makes a re-exam decision, that decision is good for all time, whichever way it goes, unlike the stark asymmetry in trial court litigation where the patent holder has to win 100 percent of the time.</text>

          <turn speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="2587.715" stopTime="2725.853">
            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="2587.715" offset="10456231">Justice Scalia, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.921" offset="10489145">I would like to begin by addressing briefly this Court's decision in RCA, because I think it's important to notice not only that Justice Cardozo used fulsome and extensive language that was intended to sweep broadly and that was intended to announce a categorical rule; the other thing is the discussion in RCA was intended and was set forward as a recapitulation of prior doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.500" offset="10575454">That is, Justice Scalia -- Justice Cardozo did not purport to announce for the first time a rule as to the weight that should be given a prior patenting decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.023" offset="10613488">He explained that this is what the Court had done since the latter part of the 19th century and in fact it had been done by Justice Story riding circuit in the early part of the 19th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.914" offset="10657061">And the court in RCA said a patent is presumed to be valid until the presumption has been overcome by convincing evidence of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.901" offset="10689034">The requirement of heightened proof was part and parcel of the presumption itself in the same way that I think most lawyers in this country would say that the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is part and parcel of the presumption of innocence in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.113" offset="10753923">If a new criminal statute were enacted saying that the defendant is presumed innocent, but the presumption can be overcome by a preponderance of the evidence, that might be a presumption of innocence, but it wouldn't be the presumption of innocence as it's historically been understood in our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.289" offset="10814527">The second thing I would say about Congress's presumed intent when it acted in 1952 is that, at least when this Court's precedents are clear, Congress when it uses words that come right from those cases should be presumed to have codified this Court's holdings, not the decisions of lower courts that may have deviated from this Court's instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.952" offset="10901253">And I think the presumption that Congress acts against the background of existing law, it's less a prediction or an assessment of what percentage of the legislature were actually aware of the details of RCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.962" offset="10957260">It's more a method of making the system work, by telling conscientious legislators: If you do read up, if you do understand the contours of Supreme Court's decisions, you can be confident that your words will be--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="2725.853" offset="11008878">Counsel, the problem with your argument, assuming its validity, is why do you need the second sentence?</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.339" offset="11034791">If Congress was intending to sweep up in the use of the word "presumption" the need to overturn it by clear and convincing evidence, why did you need the second sentence saying that the other side now bore the burden of persuasion?</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="2752.020" offset="11113472">--I think there is a belt and suspenders quality to the statute, no matter how you parse it, but I think that Microsoft has essentially the same problem, because they have constructed a theory under which the second sentence does something that the first has not, does not, but they haven't constructed any theory as to why the first sentence is not superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.833" offset="11196750">That is, given the second sentence to the effect that the burden of establishing invalidity is on the challenger, there's no more work to be done by the first sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.106" offset="11237815">The other thing I would say in response to Justice Alito's question, which also goes to the natural meaning of the statute, Justice Alito asked, I think, basically, if these precedents were not on the book and we were just looking fresh at the language, what would we assume the standard to be?</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.318" offset="11302703">And I think we would say, let's look at what the defendant is asking the judge or jury to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.305" offset="11330602">The defendant is asking the judge or jury to set aside a decision that has been made by then the Patent Office, now the PTO, and we would ask what sort of standard of proof ordinarily applies when a litigant asks a court to set aside an administrative decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.481" offset="11391310">In a sense, this court had a variant of that problem a few years ago in Dickinson v. Zurko, which dealt with direct court of appeals review of a denial by the PTO of a patent applicant's application, and the statute clearly authorized judicial review in the Federal Circuit, but said nothing about what standard would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.728" offset="11472290">And the Court said in the absence of a conflicting standard imposed by the statute, we will look to background principles and administrative law, and the standard will be substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.785" offset="11520564">And that's basically what this Court said back in 1894 in Morgan v. Daniels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.153" offset="11541985">It said the reason that we apply a heightened standard when an individual attacks the validity of an issued patent is that that litigant is asking the Court to set aside a decision made by the appropriate executive branch agency.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2872.830" offset="11596737">But that ground doesn't carry very much weight when the matter was never considered by the PTO.</text>

          <turn speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="2877.317" stopTime="3058.768">
            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="2877.317" offset="11614710">I think you are correct that if Congress had focused specifically on the category of cases in which the only evidence brought forward to show invalidity had not been considered by the PTO, it might have addressed that separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.343" offset="11682837">In our view there are three independent reasons that it makes sense to apply a heightened standard even in that category of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.116" offset="11713870">The first two have to do with the interests of the patent applicant, the third has to do with the interests of the PTO.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.420" offset="11743128">The first one is that the patent -- the grant of a patent has historically been understood to reflect a quid pro quo between the applicant and the government, and the applicant's part of the bargain was disclose that which might otherwise be maintained as a trade secret, and the government's part of the bargain was give a period of exclusivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.802" offset="11836646">And I think there is a thread in this Court's cases, especially in the barbed wire patent cases, to the effect that once the patent applicant has honored his part of the bargain a court should be hesitant to essentially deprive him of the benefit for which he contracted unless the evidence is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.663" offset="11904042">The court in the barbed wire patent cases said that whatever doubts there may be as to whether the patentee was actually the first inventor should be resolved in the patentee's favor because without question he was the one who first disclosed the information to the public, made it available to the public through the patent application process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.744" offset="11980424">The second is related to the patentee's reliance interests, but is more instrumental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.730" offset="12004352">That is, independent of our concerns for fairness to the patent applicant, Congress could reasonably determine that there are enough uncertainties along the way to getting a patent, to having it overturned on various other grounds that in an invalidity suit the patent -- the patentee should have reasonable confidence that it won't be overturned unless the evidence is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.430" offset="12103095">And I would like to respond briefly to Your Honor's question, Justice Kagan, about why isn't that diminished by the re-examination process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.334" offset="12130785">I think it is diminished somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.619" offset="12139875">Re-examination is different both because it's done by the expert agency and because it's more nuanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.772" offset="12168505">There is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.224" offset="12170282">The option to narrow the claims to revise the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.343" offset="12182821">It's not a blunderbuss tool, like setting it aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.795" offset="12192643">But I would still acknowledge the force of your observation that to some extent, the patent holder's confidence would be greater if there were no re-examination process at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.067" offset="12229736">And I guess I would say this is just one aspect of the patent law's balancing of competing interests in a way that doesn't serve either to the exclusion of the other; and to use an obvious analogy, the current term of patent protection is 20 years from the -- the date of the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.029" offset="12305492">Obviously Congress thought 20 years was better than 10 and presumably that was because 20 years gives greater incentive to innovation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3058.768" offset="12340496">Why is -- why is re-examination sufficient to answer the concerns that Justice Breyer mentioned, when re-examination can't consider certain issues, and a case such as this doesn't necessarily have to be stayed while re-examination takes place?</text>

            <text syncTime="3074.061" offset="12401622">--It's not fully sufficient to resolve all challenges to the -- the validity of an issued patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.148" offset="12421998">Now Congress now has it before it legislative proposals, one of which has passed the Senate, one of which has been voted out of committee in -- in the House, and is currently pending before the court -- the full -- full House of Representatives, that would expand the availability of post, what we now call post-grant review proceedings, where for a limited window of time after a patent is issued, people who oppose the issuance of the patent can come in and object on any ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.901" offset="12537041">And that wouldn't be limited to the -- the grounds that are specified in the current re-examination proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.853" offset="12556790">So this would -- it reflects Congress's understanding that there is a problem with patents that should not have been issued, but its desire to create additional mechanisms for the PTO to address that problem, rather than to have it be done through litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.481" offset="12623350">But that -- the point I was going to make about the 20 and the 10 years is somebody could ask, well if 20 years is better than 10, why wouldn't 30 be better than 20?</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.836" offset="12656786">And the only answer is 30 presumably would give the patentee even more -- or the potential patentee even more incentive to invent, but at a certain point Congress decides that countervailing considerations require an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.560" offset="12711643">And it has essentially done something of the same thing with re-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.096" offset="12725854">It said we're not going to go so far in the direction of protecting patent holders' reliance interests as to preclude the PTO from reassessing what it's done, but that doesn't mean that reliance interests aren't important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.904" offset="12773083">And the third thing I would say is even when a defendant in an infringement suit comes forward with prior art that was not itself considered by the PTO, there's always the possibility that that prior art will be substantively equivalent to prior art that the PTO did consider; and so in cases like this, in form the defendant would be asking the jury to make a determination that the PTO had never made, but in substance, what the defendant would be asking the jury to do is conclude that what the PTO thought was a patentable advance really was not so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3213.785" offset="12960538">First of all, with respect to the suggestion that the jury should be instructed on the weight to be given various forms of evidence, I note that in the z4 case that's been discussed, the Federal Circuit rejected the very, quote, i4i suggests as the solution, and it did so because it would confuse the jury about what the standard is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.464" offset="13043294">Having effectively three standards of proof in patent cases rather than two is hardly a solution to the problem; but more fundamentally, whatever instructions might or might not be appropriate regarding the particular evidence before the jury, there has to be a justification for departing from this default preponderance standard, and no sufficient justification has been offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.545" offset="13127617">The statute doesn't provide for it, the legislative history doesn't reference it, the pre-1952 case law can't reasonably be read in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.269" offset="13166488">That the -- i4i and its amici do not point to a single case in the -- in the years leading up to 1952, the 15 or so years prior where a court of appeals or any court or any commentator said that the rule is clear and convincing evidence across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.231" offset="13238376">No one understood that to be the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.864" offset="13244855">No one read RCA that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.433" offset="13251124">Congress would not have done so, either, so you can't get there under codification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.401" offset="13267007">You certainly can't get there under principles of administrative deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.337" offset="13278814">Even the government admits those that principles don't justify a heightened standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3315.452" offset="13367212">In other words, put the burden on the infringing party to use this procedure, and if he does use it, it's going to get a heightened burden if he loses--</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Hungar</label>
            <text syncTime="3380.644" offset="13628019">Your Honor, as you know, re-exam is not available for many of the types of invalidity issues that arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.314" offset="13654664">But in any event, if -- if -- if the Court had such a rule, the problem is, re-exam takes a long time, patents plaintiffs generally oppose stays of litigation for re-examination, because they want to get to the jury because they know that juries are much more likely to uphold patents than either judges or the Patent Office on re-exam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.593" offset="13719761">So they want to get the case litigated as quickly as possible so you get through the court system before the re-exam has been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.580" offset="13743689">So to the -- in fact if it were true, as some of the amici argue, that a patent applicant -- patent holders are afraid of juries and want the experts at PTO to resolve the questions, which we don't think as a -- as a factual matter is accurate, but if that were true, the patent applicant, the patent holder has the absolute right to initiate re-exam themselves, and they could certainly go to the court and say please stay proceedings pending re-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.843" offset="13836790">Normally when -- courts refuse to stay proceedings, because they don't want to prejudice the plaintiff, who is opposing a stay, but if the plaintiff is asking for a stay, there's not going to be any problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.683" offset="13868136">So the system already permits patent holders to -- to -- to follow that procedure and get re-examination if they want it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.705" offset="13900215">The problem is they usually don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.955" offset="13905230">And in fact a preponderance standard would encourage that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.074" offset="13917665">With respect to the reliance arguments, the re-examination problem we think addresses that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.395" offset="13935010">The fact that this is a procedural rule under this Court's precedence makes clear that reliance interests are lessened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.381" offset="13958938">In any event, the reliance interests aren't nearly as strong as the same arguments made by many of the same parties in KSR, and MedImmune and eBay where this Court was not persuaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.904" offset="13993002">It should not be persuaded here, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.887" offset="14000943">With respect to the legislative history that they rely on, if you're going to look at the legislative history, what it actually says is that Congress is referring to the presumption as stated by the courts, plural -- not the Supreme Court, courts plural -- so if you're going to look at legislative history it actually makes clear that Congress was not looking only at the RCA case which is not even referenced in the legislative history, but was looking at rule as it was understood to exist in 1952, which is not the rule that i4i urges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.555" offset="14099686">With respect to the -- the presumption point, the presumption clearly does serve a purpose, the presumption language in the statute, by overturning the courts -- the prior to 1952 decisions that had rejected the presumption, and by making clear that the burden of going forward is on the defendant, so the plaintiff doesn't have the burden that it would otherwise have of pleading and putting forward evidence at trial of validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.837" offset="14196757">For all these reasons, we ask that the judgment of the court of appeals be reversed.</text>
