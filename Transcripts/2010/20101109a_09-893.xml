            <text syncTime="10.448" offset="147163">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.056" offset="157612">The Ninth Circuit concluded in this case that a State law may mandate the use of a particular procedure in arbitration as long as the law also requires the use of that same procedure in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.254" offset="202439">That interpretation of section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act would permit a State to oppose in arbitration any procedure employed in court and thereby require arbitration to be a carbon copy of litigation, precisely what the Act was designed to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.155" offset="261998">Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act provides that an arbitration agreement may be held unenforceable under State law only if the State law rule being invoked to invalidate the agreement qualifies as a ground that exists in law or equity for the revocation of any contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.929" offset="325110">Respondent argues that, because California's Discover Bank rule does not facially discriminate against arbitration, it falls within the savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.207" offset="358233">But the plain language of the savings clause makes clear that it is not limited to statutes that discriminates facially against arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.734" offset="384355">By referring to "any contract", it makes clear that, as this Court has said, the rule must be applicable to contracts generally.</text>

            <text syncTime="111.483" offset="551330">--But the legal doctrine that the State is applying there, as States have and as we discuss in our brief, is a doctrine that applies a general principle of unconscionability with principles elucidating how it applies that apply evenhandedly across the board.</text>

            <text syncTime="127.553" offset="615591">I know you say -- you say it has to shock the conscience, but if a State wants to apply a lesser standard of unconscionability, can we strike that down?</text>

            <text syncTime="139.845" offset="664806">If it wants to apply a lesser standard to arbitration clauses, yes, absolutely you can, because that would -- that would violate what is at the core of the provision, which is discrimination against State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.665" offset="712035">If a State -- if a State enacted -- if the legislature enacted a statute and it was headed arbitration -- unconscionability, rather, and section 1 of that statute had general principles to be applied to all contractual provisions to determine unconscionability: It must shock the conscience, the question is addressed with respect to the party before the court against whom the contract is going to be applied, and the third principle is unconscionability is decided ex ante.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.532" offset="819555">And then section B said -- I'm sorry?</text>

            <text syncTime="186.589" offset="851738">A State comes in -- or I should ask: Is there no difference between a State saying these terms in a contract are unconscionable, making the petitioner always pay the fees and making him or her arbitrate in a different State -- that is unconscionable -- or a general rule of State law that says in a contract of adhesion the stronger party can't impose undue cost or expenses on the other side to vindicate their rights, whether it's in litigation and/or arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.163" offset="1026027">In your mind, there is no difference between those two things, between these two approaches to the issue?</text>

            <text syncTime="238.831" offset="1060718">Maybe if I could finish with my example, it may elucidate the distinction that I'm trying to draw.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.563" offset="1075660">So how do you address Justice Scalia's -- if you are saying there is no difference between those two things, then how can a State find those terms unconscionable?</text>

            <text syncTime="254.589" offset="1123725">I think the critical question is: Is the State applying the same principles to arbitration, of unconscionability to arbitration agreements, as to other agreements?</text>
            <text syncTime="263.944" offset="1161237">And in my example I was positing a first provision that laid out three principles that would be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.113" offset="1177851">If part B of that section, or part 2 of that section, said with respect to arbitration agreements, on the other hand, we are going to require that the procedures be equivalent to what is in court, we are going to look at the time the dispute arises rather than ex ante, and we are going to look at the effect on everyone, then I think it would be quite clear that that would be discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.152" offset="1278056">The State is simply going to say: We find this to be unconscionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.428" offset="1299163">And you say it's not unconscionable; it's very fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.835" offset="1312747">And the State says: Eh, we think it is unconscionable.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.066" offset="1465720">Maybe across the board, California is saying: We think that unconscionability should have a broader meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.030" offset="1513576">Is it unfair to the weaker party to the bargain?</text>

            <text syncTime="361.529" offset="1551506">And if that is so, that will fit our definition of unconscionability.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.416" offset="1579092">You don't have anything that says -- the California court hasn't said: We are applying a special definition of unconscionability to arbitration agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.628" offset="1639905">For example, the statute in California that defines unconscionability specifically says unconscionability shall be assessed at the time of contracting.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.436" offset="1679193">Here, the decision holding the Discover Bank rule is specifically based on a determination of unconscionability, not ex ante, when there would be a variety of situations to consider, but it is explicitly based at the time the dispute arose.</text>

            <text syncTime="440.538" offset="1867588">One is, because this rule applies to all dispute resolution provisions, it is a general -- it applies to any contract that qualifies under section 2.</text>

            <text syncTime="456.176" offset="1930073">First of all, section 2 says "any contract", and that, the Court has said, means principles that apply to contracts generally, not principles that are limited to dispute resolution contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="539.528" offset="2263500">And so we do argue that it does have a disproportionate burden, but our principal argument here is that the "any contract" requirement means that the State law rule being applied has to be a rule that applies generally to contractual provisions, as the Court has said.</text>

            <text syncTime="1182.064" offset="4833635">If the State were to adopt a general statute that said, for unconscionability purposes henceforward we will look in assessing the unconscionability of every provision at third parties, at the impact on third parties and whether it's fair to them, perhaps they could do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.606" offset="4899882">I think there might be some reasons why a State wouldn't do that, because that would upset a lot of things in the judicial system that we think of as routine, such as confidential settlements and the fact that arbitration doesn't require publication or estoppel and all kinds of rules could be invalidated on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.161" offset="4970099">But at least it would be an even-handed rule that the State applied across the board, and it would also apply to things like the level of rent in rent contracts and statutes of limitations and all sorts of things.</text>

            <text syncTime="1228.609" offset="5019836">That's I think what Justice Kagan is getting at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.623" offset="5031957">If a State wants to have a doctrine which says, you have to have a seal of a certain kind on certain kinds of contracts, they've never done it before, but now they do it, and on that kind you have to have a seal both on the arbitration contract and on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.081" offset="5109697">And here what they've done is they have listed the four characteristics from Discover Bank, and they've said all contracts to do with litigation have to satisfy those four.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.373" offset="5158912">At which point I think Justice Kagan said, so what if they've never done this before?</text>

            <text syncTime="1272.869" offset="5196946">And what's the basis for saying that the Arbitration Act or any other part of Federal law forbids California from doing that?</text>

            <text syncTime="1285.505" offset="5247415">First of all, they haven't done it generally with respect to contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.830" offset="5264760">They have made up a special rule that is targeted on a special kind of contract and that carries -- to the extent one is worried about discrimination -- nonfacial discrimination designing the category of contracts relating to litigation or dispute resolution is precisely the kind of category that most presents the risk of discrimination that isn't facial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.758" offset="5360473">And again, whatever any contract means, we think it has to mean that the category of dispute resolution contracts can't be one that satisfies any contract, because at the time the law was enacted the ouster doctrine did just that and it was the doctrine that was being targeted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.484" offset="5423376">But it seems to me that all State -- most State statutes pertaining to contracts pertain to a class that is not entirely universal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.605" offset="5459843">Suppose the State had a statute referring to banks, contracts with banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.776" offset="5480532">That doesn't apply to all contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1347.462" offset="5495265">But we know that it applies to a class that generally includes both arbitration and non-arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.802" offset="5520656">And that's this case, because there can be class action rule with respect to litigation and class action rules with respect to arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1391.752" offset="5672479">And the reason for that we think is because of the ouster doctrine it was confronted with, which did apply to both arbitration and litigation contracts, and because of the risk generally that a contract rule could be devised that maybe didn't facially discriminate against arbitration, but had the effect of targeting arbitration disproportionately and that's what is going on here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1584.420" offset="6443092">As I think several of the questions this morning have brought out, the question here is not what this Court would decide if it were sitting as the Supreme Court of California and applying the State's common law in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.538" offset="6491575">Rather, the question is whether the State law at issue falls within a statutory savings clause that expressly preserves contract defenses available at law or in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.531" offset="6535565">The State law at issue here is not preemptive, for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.388" offset="6550925">First, it is consistent with the equal footing principle or nondiscrimination principle that this Court has consistently recognized is embodied in section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.807" offset="6584675">Second, it's consistent with two key purposes that the savings clause fulfills under the FAA: ensuring that arbitration is a matter of consent and not coercion; and that it represents merely a choice of forum, but not an exemption from the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.193" offset="6650190">And third, the State law at issue is a correct and legitimate application of the State's common law to which this Court should defer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1658.763" offset="6740470">I think that the savings clause in the FAA serves two critical purposes, and that is that the -- the contract law doctrines ensure consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.601" offset="6779862">You don't have arbitration unless you have a consensual agreement between both parties, and you look to State contract law to determine whether there is consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.612" offset="6811836">And also, I think as this Court has repeatedly said about arbitration under the FAA, it represents a choice of forum, but it doesn't withdraw the parties from the substantive liability rules of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1766.106" offset="7169818">And so the Concepcions are situated just like any other AT&amp;T customer, and that is the point at which fairness is assessed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2974.390" offset="12002994">What is the difference -- let me change it slightly -- between a rule that says you must follow the rules of evidence in every adjudication and a rule that says that class adjudication must always be available?</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.245" offset="12050432">I think your answer comes down to the proposition that the former is inconsistent with the idea of arbitration, and therefore, that's why it's not allowed, and the latter is not inconsistent with the idea of arbitration, and therefore, it is allowed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3393.130" offset="13677965">Although we believe we win under the principle of obstacle preemption that was just being discussed for the reasons that were enunciated in Stolt-Nielsen, we think there is a much easier way for this Court to decide this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.499" offset="13727389">Congress when it wrote section 2 used the phrase "any contract".</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.025" offset="13749541">And it clearly did that for a reason, and the reason was it wasn't -- it recognized, as Justice Sotomayor said, that there could be attempts through nondiscriminatory provisions to injure arbitration; and the protection Congress adopted was a prophylactic rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.053" offset="13809622">It said if the State law rule that the State is trying to apply to an arbitration clause applies broadly to a large set of clauses, that's the best protection against discrimination and that's why the "any contract" language is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.297" offset="13862599">And so, in answer to your question, Justice Sotomayor, about where to look for, for what "any contract" means, we think it means very broad; and the Court has said that, and the doctrines that the court has identified as qualifying -- duress, fraud and unconscionability -- are doctrines that apply broadly across the entire range of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.103" offset="13929785">But one thing that is very clear, we think, is that it can't mean -- "any contract" can't mean any dispute resolution contract, because that is the gerrymandered category that most presents the risk of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.299" offset="13982657">And if the Court holds that that category is impermissible to justify a rule, it deals with all of the hypotheticals that are being discussed because they are all jury waivers, discovery, evidence; those are all rules that, as the Court has propagated as hypotheticals, are rules that apply to all dispute resolution clauses, and they are focused on dispute resolution clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.355" offset="14062801">So we think that disposes of the argument that Discover Bank can be applied, simply because it applies to litigation contracts and arbitration contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.241" offset="14098432">The next question is Respondents' second argument, which is okay, if that is not a reason it falls within the savings clause, it falls within the savings clause because it's simply an application of California's general unconscionability doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.720" offset="14156319">And that is where we turn to the first part of the issues I was discussing in the issues that -- that I was discussing in the first part of the argument with the Court, which is it isn't, because in the three particulars that I listed, it is clearly a totally different legal rule that simply has the unconscionability label on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.450" offset="14211176">And just to drill down on my colleague's discussion that this was really an ex ante analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.478" offset="14239284">It couldn't be an ex ante analysis, because that would have to take into account that the vast majority of claims that anyone will ever have under a contract are nonclassable claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.959" offset="14281289">And as to nonclassable claims, it's clear that the arbitration process is infinitely better than the court process, because for most small consumer claims there is no real court process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.297" offset="14322563">And so if one were to make an ex ante assessment of the fairness for the parties of the court, it wouldn't just be about classable claims; it would have to include nonclassable claims; and as to those claims it is clear that there is a tremendous benefit to those people from the arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.900" offset="14385048">With respect to exculpation, my friend referred to the California rule that the contract has to have a public effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.878" offset="14420888">That is not about effects on third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.499" offset="14431441">In the Tunkl case, which is a California Supreme Court case that we cite, the court makes clear that it's looking for contracts that -- in which public services are being performed and that are otherwise imbued with a public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.698" offset="14488179">It's not looking at all at the effects on third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.681" offset="14500195">Finally, my colleague spoke about lots of class arbitrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.800" offset="14524646">To our knowledge all of those class arbitrations were arbitrations that were conducted before this Court's decision in Stolt-Nielsen where a party had a silent agreement and therefore it was held by some lower courts to mean that class arbitration was permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.704" offset="14576264">We are not aware as we say in our brief of any contract that explicitly permits class arbitrations for the reasons that the Court discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.433" offset="14607193">It's not -- just not something that makes any sense.</text>
