            <text syncTime="10.447" offset="147163">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.773" offset="160538">When Kevin Kasten told his employer that the location of the time clocks was illegal and that if they were taken to the court they would lose, he filed any complaint within the meaning of the 215(a)(3) under the Fair Labor Standards Act, because filing includes an oral communication, because "any" means any, which includes formal or informal, written or unwritten communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.856" offset="256878">And the words in the statute were designed to have a broad construction under section 2 of the statute 202 and under Mitchell v. DeMario and the Tennessee Coal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.836" offset="304734">I would like to begin with the Tennessee Coal case, Tennessee Coal v. Muscoda.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.789" offset="324587">The Court interpreted "work" in a broad fashion to include the time in a mine when workers were moving from one place to another, not actually engaged in physical labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.142" offset="365965">In interpreting work that way, the Court said that the act is not to be interpreted in a narrow, grudging fashion.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>

            <text syncTime="76.107" offset="409851">Suppose a company has an established policy that if you want to make a complaint, there's a particular supervisor you should go to.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.963" offset="445273">And let's say they say you can make this complaint in writing, you can make it orally.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.666" offset="464081">Now, there's -- something's going on in the workplace and the supervisor happens to be walking by, maybe a machine is broken, an employee has been hurt, and an employee walks up to the supervisor who is walking briskly by, taps the supervisor on the shoulder and says the company is violating the Fair Labor Standards Act because of the placement of a clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.405" offset="551016">You said that filing has no formality requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.685" offset="564182">Would that be the filing of a complaint?</text>

            <text syncTime="118.904" offset="581005">I don't think that the fact that the employer has a policy that says you do it on Tuesday morning would control what the statute says one way or the other, so I think it would constitute a filing.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.805" offset="764594">The reason I'm asking that question is related to Justice Alito's question, which is, what does filing a complaint mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="174.164" offset="802105">Does it have to be relative to the procedures adopted by the person that you are reporting this to?</text>

            <text syncTime="211.553" offset="951630">We are now forcing the Government to adopt an oral procedure even if it chose not to?</text>

            <text syncTime="1822.765" offset="7396456">Because the reason why you can be comfortable with a willfulness standard even which extends to conscious disregard beyond the intent as well, but the reason why you can be comfortable with that is if you look at the way the statute is crafted in terms of the retaliation provision itself, it speaks specifically to formal actions that are taken, the filing of a complaint, the institution of a proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1939.886" offset="7864989">So that when Congress enacted this statute in 1938, it didn't say boo about allowing the employees to show up in court and to assert their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.635" offset="7895918">This is not part of that expansive, grant rights to the employee's portion of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.396" offset="7922981">And then second, Justice Ginsburg, with respect to the specifics of what did Congress have in mind, it seems to me the better way to evaluate this is not did Congress have in mind a group of illiterate employees or not, but what language did Congress use in trying to formulate the specific provision that gives rise to the protections against retaliation.</text>
