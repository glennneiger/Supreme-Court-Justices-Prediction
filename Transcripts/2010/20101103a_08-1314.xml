            <text syncTime="9.606" offset="143820">The issue here is whether a common law claim that Mazda should have equipped Mrs. Williamson's seating position with a lap/shoulder belt is impliedly preempted under the rationale of Geier v. American Honda.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.329" offset="194706">The claim is not preempted, because it is perfectly consistent with and would not frustrate the objectives of the operative 1989 version of Standard 208 governing Type 2 seatbelts in rear seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.423" offset="255101">One point that is clear from this Court's express preemption holding in Geier is that Congress intended common law to play a complementary role in achieving the objectives of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.116" offset="309854">Based on the savings clause, the Court decided that Congress intended to preserve a significant role for State tort law to operate in compensating accident victims and promoting greater safety in vehicle design.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.525" offset="371503">And, on the issue of implied obstacle preemption, the majority also agreed with the dissent that State common law will not be preempted unless there is clear evidence of a conflict with Federal objectives.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.595" offset="1203764">But any type of -- of consideration of technology and costs is as of that moment in time, and the agency specifically encouraged manufacturers to install Type 2 lap/shoulder belts in these types of seating positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.255" offset="1262488">And our lawsuit is perfectly consistent with the agency's objective of encouraging lap/shoulder belts in these seating positions.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.515" offset="1327480">I understand that their objective was to encourage this, but it was clearly not to impose it, because it thought at that time that the costs were too great.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.001" offset="1357469">So to simply say their objective was to get these in ignores the other side of the cost/benefit analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.563" offset="1427686">And yes, it found enough countervailing considerations in terms of cost and feasibility not to mandate that as part of the Federal minimum standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.669" offset="1468123">And so from the Federal Government's perspective, for these seating positions, the government was neutral as between Type 1 and Type 2 belts.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.794" offset="1504590">Either one of those belts would have sufficed to satisfy the Federal agency's objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.947" offset="1529250">And therefore a State law claim that eliminates effectively one of those options does not in any way frustrate the agency's objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.434" offset="1563105">The government has explained in its brief that its objectives would have been fully satisfied if all car manufacturers had installed Type 2 lap/shoulder belts immediately.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.159" offset="1710017">The determinative agency policy at issue in Geier was that the agency deliberately sought a variety of different passive restraint types.</text>

            <text syncTime="1192.801" offset="4876581">Two responses, Justice Alito.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.570" offset="4883686">First, the question presented here about Type 1 versus Type 2 seatbelts has only been by decided by a couple of federal courts of appeals, no states courts at last resort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.009" offset="4921407">Second, on the more general question, why doesn't NHTSA participate in these cases, NHTSA as a matter of course does not usually participate in private party litigation under State common law, even when that litigation might touch on a State -- the interpretation of a Federal safety standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.186" offset="4982115">And when the courts asked for NHTSA's views, NHTSA generally responds, as this Court asks for the government's views in this case and the government responded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.624" offset="5015865">And I think if the Court were to look back to the first brief that the government -- in astring of briefs that the government has filed about these issues underthis act, the brief in Wood versus General Motors filed in 1990, you could predict the position that the government would takein this case from that brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.698" offset="5072185">The government said in that case that options don't preempt, merely because they are options.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.935" offset="5097159">In most cases there will be no federal policy that presents a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.054" offset="5117639">That case presented the case of the passive restraint phase-in and there it was the rare circumstance, as the Court later held in Geier, where there was frustration of the Federal policy, but that's because the Federal policy was to encourage variety, not just for its own sake, but because variety would serve safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.031" offset="5185557">The roads would be measurably less safe if airbags were rushed into service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.252" offset="5206455">By contrast, in this case NHTSA would have been perfectly happy if every manufacturer had installed Type 2 seatbelts the day after the 1989 rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.906" offset="5237070">So there was no conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.891" offset="5245012">As far as the child safety concern to which Justice Sotomayor alluded, it is referred to in the 1984 denial of a request to impose the rule that later was imposed in 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.163" offset="5290047">The agency said that it had concerns about how particular child seats, which at the time were anchored with a form of tether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.953" offset="5321185">And it said that it thought the continued use of tethered car seats was something that it chose to encourage rather than anchoring them with Type 2 seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.124" offset="5353890">The agency did not speak at all to whether Type 2 versus Type 1 was better for child safety and the agency then answered that in the 1989 rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.480" offset="5391297">So for adults Type 2 seatbelts are safer and they encourage seatbelt use because they are more popular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.900" offset="5417002">For infants, the agency specifically asked whether Type 2 seatbelts could be as efficacious as Type 1 seatbelts in holding an infant car seat in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.240" offset="5454409">It concluded that they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.692" offset="5460156">That's set out at page 25 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.608" offset="5467888">And for toddlers, children who are too small to sit in a Type 2 seatbelt without assistance, the agency recommended booster seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.080" offset="5505714">And if there was no booster seat the agency recommended that they not use the shoulder belt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.451" offset="5523268">Not that they detached the shoulder belt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.051" offset="5529642">The agency indeed specifically rejected the idea that the shoulder belt should be removed at page 47990 of the notice of proposed rulemaking--</text>

            <text syncTime="1378.246" offset="5618354">At the time, no, that lawsuit would not have been preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.398" offset="5630997">Mr. Buchanan said that that would be harder case and I think he said that because the agency was specifically encouraging Type 2 seatbelts, and in this case Respondents can't show anything suggesting that the agency was encouraging Type 1 seatbelts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.157" offset="5682092">So it might be a harder case for that reason, but at that time there were two ways of complying with the Federal minimum standard and the savings clause provides that simply complying with the Federal standard does not preempt the operation of State common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.982" offset="5733397">So we discussed the child safety, the alleged child safety rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.302" offset="5758579">I want to say a word about the idea that aisle seats were unsafe for the installation of these seatbelts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.539" offset="5783552">As Mr. Buchanan mentioned, the agency specifically encouraged the installation of those seats where it was feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.443" offset="5807167">It was found to be feasible in 1991 by General Motors, which installed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.345" offset="5822840">But another word about that, because Respondents have suggested that the chief counsel of NHTSA has said in 1994 in a letter something favorable to their position, and that letter is reproduced in the appendix to the Petitioner's reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.802" offset="5876652">I urge the Court to look at the entire letter and not the sentence that was excerpted several times in Respondents' brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.289" offset="5898595">Because what the agency said was that, in response to someone who complained that manufacturers were installing Type 2 seatbelts and they said, the complainant said that makes these minivans unsafe because people will be trapped in the back seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.568" offset="5963692">The agency said it disagreed, that people could go under the safety belt, that they could detach the safety belt, that the safety benefits of a Type 2 seatbelt outweighed any convenience concern about access to or egress from the rear seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.160" offset="6026073">And I think that is perfectly consistent with the policy NHTSA has taken all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.112" offset="6037880">Type 2 seatbelts are safer, more effective and to be encouraged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.164" offset="6058047">When NHTSA decided not to mandate that based on its understanding at the time of who used seatbelts, who used seatbelts in the rear center seats and what the -- how many fatalities and injuries would be prevented and whether the dollar cost would be justified by -- by the dollar equivalent of injuries and fatalities prevented, it wasn't making a preemptive judgment that Type 2 seatbelts, therefore, should not be installed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.963" offset="6161283">And for that reason there is no frustration of anything that NHTSA had in mind in the 1989 rulemaking by allowing this tort suit to proceed as saved by the Savings Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1565.211" offset="6366292">But that's not the case here because the agency actually encouraged earlier compliance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.500" offset="6411431">In 1984 and again in 1989 the agency specifically determined that the statutory safety and practicability objectives would be best served by giving manufacturers the flexibility to install a lap-only or lap/shoulder seatbelt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1593.745" offset="6480394">How is this case different from a situation where the agency looks at a request for a minimum standard, says: Require that a certain light be added to the lights in a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.441" offset="6559180">The agency comes back and says, you know, there are so many designs of cars; in some cars, particularly sedans, the light is an added safety feature; in vans it may not be because of the size of vans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.385" offset="6622919">And so we are not going to require it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.135" offset="6629919">We are going to let manufacturers, depending on what design their car has, to choose between the two, so that we're not going to set a minimum standard for every one because there are too many different designs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.193" offset="6682164">Despite that ruling, the manufacturer says it costs two pennies more to put this light in a sedan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.231" offset="6718318">I know the agency has said it's safer, but I don't want to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.535" offset="6739529">I don't have a van, I don't have any reason except the two pennies that I don't want to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.289" offset="6766592">Is that case preempted?</text>

            <text syncTime="2786.734" offset="11252339">Comments came back and the agency backed off from that and said, we have to examine this more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.553" offset="11271670">And secondly, that positive -- no positive or negative statement -- could only apply when child -- when children were using the boosters which would help with the Type 2 shoulder belt so the belt wasn't going over the neck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.278" offset="11322556">But NHTSA knew at that time that very few, less than 1 percent, of parents were actually putting their kids in the booster seats.</text>

            <text syncTime="2812.650" offset="11355993">This was at a time when many children weren't in any car seats at all, no matter what NHTSA was saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.169" offset="11374070">So they recognized that they were at real risk here, that children -- children with a Type 2 belt, just to be clear -- and NHTSA recognized this during the 1989 rulemaking -- that belt is going to pose an obvious safety risk to children, because the shoulder belt that is terrific for adults is going to take -- is going to create unique chest loads on children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.649" offset="11455990">And if the children is not on a booster, as virtually all were not, the belt is going to appear too high on the head -- on the neck or head, which is a safety problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2864.483" offset="11563301">And anyone who has tried to install a child car seat with a Type 2 belt, the lap/shoulder belt, knows how difficult it was.</text>

            <text syncTime="2877.691" offset="11616172">And another thing that happened is over time, booster seats became more accepted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2907.773" offset="11736545">You had rulemakings in '84 and '89 and it adopted a very unique approach to resolving the safety issue, which was to expressly give manufacturers this option to advance Federal safety and practicability objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.097" offset="11789834">We haven't talked as much about the practicability objectives, but that is one of the statutory objectives of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.499" offset="11811464">Congress couldn't have been more clear on that and the agency in 1989 couldn't have been more clear in the final notice, saying we are not going to require manufacturers to install Type 2 belts in the rear center and aisle seats because that's just too costly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.475" offset="11867366">It's substantially expensive and the agency well knew based on its history that imposing this sort of overly costly safety measures that the Type 2 belt would have been for these seats at that time could have proved counterproductive with the agency's long-term safety mission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.818" offset="11928701">The agency said that in the rulemaking in this case at 52 Federal Register 22819 where it said that requiring these kind of overly costly measures created a lost opportunity to improve safety through other means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.828" offset="11984708">This is something that Congress gave the agency the expert judgment to make on these matters and the practicability objectives, which was just as much a statutory objective as a safety objective, would have been directly frustrated if, as could have happened under the Petitioners position in this case, on the very day after the agency passed this rule in 1989 and said we are not going to require rear inboard seats to have Type 2 lap/shoulder belts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.930" offset="12101110">A jury in California hit my client with a multimillion dollar punitive damages award because they did not install a Type 2 belt in that seat.</text>

            <text syncTime="3010.100" offset="12145831">It would have undermined the safety objectives that the agency recognized and it would have undermined the practicability objectives that the agency recognized, and then you have this world in which manufacturers like my client could be hit with multimillion dollar punitive damages award in one state for installing the Type 2 belt where a child was injured or someone was in the back seat and couldn't get out.</text>

            <text syncTime="3181.821" offset="12832747">First of all, I would like to clear up the child safety issue and I know Mr. Jay has addressed this to some extent, but let me be perfectly clear, there is absolutely nothing in the '87 to '89 regulatory history that mentions anything about child safety being a consideration in the agency's decision not to mandate Type 2 shoulder belts for aisle and center seating positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.122" offset="12929923">Specifically, Justice Ginsberg asked Mr. Garre about whether there is anything about the rear center seat being the safest place for children in that regulatory history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.311" offset="12966703">There is no mention whatsoever in that regulatory history about that issue, and the reason for that is this: The reason the rear center seat was considered safer for children had nothing to do with the type of seatbelt that was installed in that seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.738" offset="13028352">It's considered safest for children because it's farthest from the potential point of impact in a side impact collision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3238.142" offset="13058027">When you talk about safety to children, are you also addressing the strap going across the aisle or the strap interfering with vision?</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.413" offset="13091046">I know that is not directly related to children, but it affects what type of belt might be the safest overall.</text>

            <text syncTime="3252.817" offset="13116646">You are right, Mr. Chief Justice, that was not expressed in any way in terms of a child safety concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.721" offset="13140261">I would also, minor correction, the interference with rear vision was a comment that a commenter made in the regulatory history and the agency never really expressed an opinion one way or the other about whether that was a concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.111" offset="13193864">I think what's really important here is that state tort law provides an incentive for manufacturers to exercise their options reasonably.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.669" offset="13236078">And whether that option is to exceed a minimum standard that doesn't have options, or to choose between two different options that a minimum standard provides, state tort law ensures that manufacturers act reasonably.</text>

            <text syncTime="3300.564" offset="13307653">But state tort law doesn't, juries typically don't take into account the fleet costs of avoiding liability, which as I understand from the SG's brief in this case was the reason that Type 2 was not mandated, because of the overall costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.824" offset="13368675">You have a jury with an injured plaintiff, they are not likely to weigh heavily the fact that this would cost 3 extra cents per car fleet wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.930" offset="13405142">I think that is the sort of thing NHTSA considers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3327.496" offset="13415382">--Mr. Chief Justice, under any state's tort law, I think cost and feasibility would be practical considerations for the jury under the jury instructions given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.737" offset="13452372">Those are liability issues, cost and feasibility in any tort system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.474" offset="13475359">And so that's a liability issue down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.943" offset="13493227">Here it's important to preserve state tort law because Congress said state tort law shall be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.865" offset="13524888">And again, whether it's a choice between options, Type 1 or Type 2, or whether it's potential liability for not going beyond the minimum braking standard, either way manufacturers should be held accountable according to Congress in its enactment of the statute for the design choices they make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.196" offset="13606181">There is nothing different about a design standard option 1 versus option 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.830" offset="13628750">The final point I want to make before I sit down is that I think in some respects this case with regard to the question about whether Congress intended for the agency to be the exclusive authority for weighing these types of considerations, in some respects Wyeth versus Levine is instructive here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.159" offset="13722060">Because I think that was the same argument that was made in Wyeth versus Levine, that a jury should not be allowed to second-guess the FDA's labeling issues and to allow the jury to do so would subvert the exclusive authority of a Federal agency, and the Court rejected that argument in Wyeth, and as the dissent pointed out in Wyeth, that statute did not even have a Savings Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.811" offset="13820698">And it did not define the labeling standards as minimum standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.429" offset="13839088">Here we have a much more clear expression of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.250" offset="13854448">They intended these to be minimum standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.035" offset="13865524">They have a savings clause that says common law liability shall be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.153" offset="13882034">Obviously Congress did not intend NHTSA to be the exclusive safety standard cook.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.474" offset="13907320">They deliberately preserved state court juries as also providing for additional vehicle safety and for an incentive to manufacture safer vehicles.</text>
