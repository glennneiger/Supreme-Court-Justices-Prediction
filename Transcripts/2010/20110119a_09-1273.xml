            <text syncTime="9.956" offset="144259">There are three reasons why section 340B entities do not have a cause of ation to enforce the pharmaceutical pricing agreement between the Secretary and manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.781" offset="199534">The first reason is that this common law breach of contract suit is indistinguishable from an implied right of action to enforce the statute, a right Respondent concedes it does not have.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="37.673" offset="255122">I don't understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.625" offset="262855">A private contract is just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.243" offset="273408">Two parties go into the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.445" offset="286156">They set the terms of their deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.578" offset="294724">No one forced the manufacturers to enter into this deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.217" offset="321264">So why isn't the issue exactly what the circuit court said: What was the intent of the parties to the contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="64.239" offset="361388">You want to make it Congress's intent, but this is a private deal between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.810" offset="379674">And Congress may have specified some terms to include; but--</text>

            <label>Ms. Lisa S. Blatt</label>

            <text syncTime="76.880" offset="411961">And the -- what is being challenged here is the contractual term that incorporates in haec verba the manufacturer's ceiling price obligations under the act, and a third party beneficiary's suit to enforce the contract asserts the same right, seeks the same remedy, and causes all the same disruptions as a right of action to enforce the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.032" offset="520526">And another way of saying that is, if the case begins with the premise that Congress foreclosed 340B entities from bringing an implied right of action through the front door, Congress did not leave the back door open to essentially the same suit.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="119.326" offset="581653">--How do you answer the point that, if Congress wanted to make this a pure regulatory statute, it wouldn't have even required a contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="129.365" offset="621881">It would have just passed a statute that says anyone who wants to -- to sell to the -- to the States or to the 340B entities, you can't charge more than this price?</text>
            <text syncTime="143.959" offset="680187">Why do we even need a contract, unless inherent with it is some discretion in the agency who's administering it?</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="152.396" offset="713937">--discretion that is consistent with normal contract principles?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lisa_s_blatt" startTime="156.765" stopTime="277.839">
            <label>Ms. Lisa S. Blatt</label>
            <text syncTime="156.765" offset="731491">--Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.048" offset="732536">Well, our position is obviously that the parties had no discretion to confer Article III power on courts to enforce an act of Congress, and this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.885" offset="763988">But the -- the basic answer is that there has always been a huge difference between the settled rule that parties to a statutory contract are enforceable -- they have a cause of action to enforce the contract, because Congress spoke with unambiguously clear language that the parties could sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.199" offset="845176">That's the way statutory contracts must work.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.567" offset="854685">They must be enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.133" offset="860954">But your answer, sort of as a practical matter, what's the difference, is this is a -- this is a contract, and we do think that the Federal law of contracts and contractual remedies flow between the parties to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.107" offset="908810">It is a bilateral agreement, it is not a regulation and the Secretary made specific enforceable promises.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.678" offset="935142">And there's obviously no even operation of the statutory mandate without the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.581" offset="958757">But the reverse, in terms of the -- the long-settled rule that parties must be able to sue to enforce a contract, there's an equally settled rule that beneficiaries under a statute do not have the right to enforce it unless there's a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.258" offset="1017480">Now, the test that I think Respondent advocates and that the Ninth Circuit applied is a test this Court has long since discarded, which is: Well, I'm a beneficiary, and this is a good idea, and this is sensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.732" offset="1067321">Even if you don't buy our test of you have to imply the implied right of action, these lawsuits are neither sensible nor a good idea and not what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.854" offset="1107864">And here's why.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.539" offset="1114551">And it is basically the second and third reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.506" offset="1122388">So no matter how you come at this case and the lens through which you look at this, I think everyone should come out to the same place, which is that neither Congress nor the Secretary nor the manufacturers signed up to what is in essence -- would be over 14,000 lawsuits against 500 manufacturers challenging the pricing for over 35,000 medications under Medicaid.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="277.839" offset="1215801">Your adversary claims you gave up your argument that the contract doesn't make the manufacturers a third-party intended beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.630" offset="1254881">Have you given up that argument?</text>

            <label>Ms. Lisa S. Blatt</label>

            <text syncTime="289.297" offset="1261568">I think that the -- that the whole thrust of the petition -- and obviously the primary argument is that this flouts the implied right of action jurisprudence and it -- it conflicts with congressional intent in all events.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.104" offset="1300856">But one of the harms and just sort of illustrating how bad the decision was is this conferred rights that the parties never imagined and that the Secretary did not -- did not intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.476" offset="1338264">But I -- I think that in our view, even if the Secretary had wanted to, it is not the Secretary's decision nor was it the manufacturers' decision to go contract by contract and say this multi-billion dollar health care program that incorporates another, even bigger multi-billion dollar health care program, we're going to turn this over to Federal enforcement, when on the face of the statute reflects a deliberate decision by Congress to withhold--</text>

            <text syncTime="345.266" offset="1485490">And those three specifics, in addition to the disruptions, are that Congress gave manufacturers but not 340B entities a private reimbursement remedy and a private--</text>

            <text syncTime="355.890" offset="1527912">Is it -- I'm not sure of the answer, but is it different in this case or unusual that the agreement is between the Federal Government and private entities, as opposed to what I think is the more typical situation in which these cases come up, where it is, say, an agreement between the Federal Government and the State?</text>

            <text syncTime="374.185" offset="1601160">--Well, all your Medicaid cases obviously under State plans, and a lot of your implied right of action jurisprudence is dealing with spending clause legislation as to State entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.259" offset="1649434">But there are a number, a number -- the Rehabilitation Act, the Davis-Bacon Act, and a fair number of health care programs -- where the government contracts with private parties as a public welfare mechanism to get to what I think are conceded are beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.353" offset="1713800">Here, there's a number of beneficiaries.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.275" offset="1745460">Ms. Blatt, would you explain the function that the contract mechanism serves?</text>
            <text syncTime="416.945" offset="1772210">I mean, you could just have the -- just have the statute say, thou shalt not charge more than the ceiling price, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.384" offset="1801885">What if -- what is accomplished by having the contract reflecting the terms of the statute?</text>

            <label>Ms. Lisa S. Blatt</label>
            <text syncTime="433.307" offset="1837620">Well, I don't think it is any different than Mobil Oil or Jackson Transit, where Congress wants to specify the terms of the contract and the contract incorporates in haec verba the statutory terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.782" offset="1883491">And if there's a breach of that, there are contractual remedies that flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.817" offset="1899687">But I agree with you that there's not a whole lot of difference between our position and the government, because the government is absolutely correct that it is in haec verba and identical, and the statutory obligation that we're talking about that's incorporated into the contract is that a certain ceiling price must be charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.195" offset="1969173">But the -- the other sort of practical function is only manufacturers who enter into this contract are subject to these price controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.515" offset="1994459">So if they -- if a pharmaceutical manufacturer doesn't want to participate in the program, they're not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.705" offset="2023194">And in a typical regulation and I think sort of general spending clause analysis, someone who accepts Federal funding has considered sort of implicit consent to the funding obligations because they're taking the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.477" offset="2066348">But here's there's an express manifestation, both by the Secretary who signed the agreement and the contractors, the pharmaceutical companies who signed the agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="527.802" offset="2215560">We're still -- today is no different than yesterday, because nothing has happened to implement the 2010 health care reform except that there are now more civil monetary penalties than there were.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.826" offset="2259655">But the government has statutory penalties, civil monetary penalties, the right of audit.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.278" offset="2281493">It can bring suits under the False Claims Act and can terminate both this agreement and the Medicaid rebate agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.984" offset="2312317">But as a -- the government has contractual remedies, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.455" offset="2334260">I mean, why Congress, I think -- a sensible inference for why Congress -- Congress picked contracts is that this is -- this piggybacks off the Medicaid rebate program and that uses contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.529" offset="2382535">And that instead -- that in turn, rather, used contracts because the States had negotiated rebate agreements with drug companies way before 1990.</text>

            <text syncTime="582.070" offset="2432690">And then, since the pricing components under this program are the same pricing components under the Medicaid rebate programs, both programs are parallel and they both used agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1078.707" offset="4419250">This is very similar to Medicare provider agreements, in which a health care provider who wants to enter into the Medicare program and provide services agrees, signs an agreement in which he agrees to abide by the statutes and regulations set forth in the Medicare program and in return for that agreement is given the opportunity to participate in the Medicaid -- in the Medicare program.</text>

            <text syncTime="1227.172" offset="5013065">And when you look at the statutory scheme as a whole, it is a regulatory scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="3070.492" offset="12386388">What's different there is that there has to be some inside whistleblower who can pass through the very difficult hurdles of a False Claims Act case; whereas here we are talking about benefit of the bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.001" offset="12436438">The manufacturers agreed by contract they were only going to charge a ceiling price, and we assert based on -- you know -- quite extensive reports by Officers of Inspector General that they have not been charging that price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.325" offset="12493699">They've been charging in excess of that price, and all we are asking for is the delta.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.813" offset="12515641">And the government in its Massachusetts submissions has acknowledged that this type of best price litigation is not so complicated because all one needs to do is figure out did the drug companies sell the particular drug to some other entity for a lower price; and if that's so, that's the price you apply across the board to all the 340B entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.844" offset="12607801">The argument about distraction and intrusion, Justice Ginsburg, I would respectfully submit is a gross overstatement of what actually happens in this type of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.802" offset="12651583">And to the extent that there are complexities, the complexities are introduced by the drug companies for the sole purpose of masking what price they are charging to the 340B entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.210" offset="12701215">Because all these various mechanisms, the bundling of drugs, the use of kickbacks and payments to purchasers, are all designed to mask what the true price of the drug is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.852" offset="12747818">And if Congress intended anything in the program, and in getting the Secretary to implement this program through statutes, it was that the 340B entities who are providing drugs and medical service to the poorest of our citizens should be entitled to the benefits of the collective market created by these 340B drug purchases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3220.890" offset="12987935">And the reason we don't know is because the Secretary has already missed the first statutory deadline for issuing implementing regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.746" offset="13019387">There was no statement of rules in the notice of proposed rulemaking, as is ordinarily the case for agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.400" offset="13046032">The Secretary simply put out for comment that we are going to develop procedures and rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.387" offset="13069960">So we don't know whether or not the Secretary will express some further intent as to how these new rules are to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.892" offset="13099948">But I would submit that this Court's cases are very clear, that a later enactment of Congress is not intent of what an earlier Congress has stated; and the absence of any specific remedial provision coupled with the use of agreements carries with it the ordinary presumption that Congress intended for that cluster of common law rights to be associated with the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.639" offset="13186988">And that's certainly been the way this Court has enforced contracts involving the government itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3286.299" offset="13249578">If I may just talk about the drug companies, Lipitor, and the common law; and if you want, I can also talk about States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.421" offset="13274028">We take, obviously, deep umbrage at the suggestion that the drug companies are somehow against these clinics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.508" offset="13302450">Any Internet search will show you that the amount of discounts given under this program equals the amount of free drugs that are given to these same clinics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.681" offset="13335155">And I'd also, probably a better response is you can look at any rebate release issued by the Secretary of HHS or any page of their CFR, and if you think it's simple, I would be shocked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.589" offset="13386773">On Lipitor, it is not the case that the Central District of California decides nationwide what the price of Lipitor is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.879" offset="13427942">The -- under the other side's view, the Southern District of Texas, the Northern District of New York, and the District in Alabama would all decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.002" offset="13468379">And what's really bad -- it is bad enough to have 14,000 suits over 35,000 drugs; but what he's talking about, best price, and average manufactured price that determines the States' rebate programs because the rebate program is a rebate, and the ceiling price program is a ceiling price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.399" offset="13546015">When one of the pricing components goes up, such as average manufacture price, the States benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.219" offset="13569317">They get more money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.002" offset="13572451">But generally, 340B entities, their ceiling price goes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.687" offset="13591155">So what's good for the 340B company -- entity is bad for the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.341" offset="13613725">And that's not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.860" offset="13619785">He just says it is hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.443" offset="13626159">But he's asked for millions and millions and millions and millions and more millions of transactions that go to that very pricing component.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.418" offset="13666074">Common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.651" offset="13674956">On pages 9 to 11a of the petition appendix is a good three or four citations to the third-party beneficiary Federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.743" offset="13715393">And the courts go out of their way to say it is not enough to be a direct beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.129" offset="13740889">The analysis is exactly the same under implied right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.514" offset="13754472">Is there clear and unambiguous intent to confer enforceable rights?</text>

            <text syncTime="3418.335" offset="13777774">We just think because it is in haec verba with the statute, it's congressional intent that controlling, not the parties.</text>
