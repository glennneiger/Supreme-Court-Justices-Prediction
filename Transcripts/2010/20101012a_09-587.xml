            <text syncTime="1261.749" offset="5152434">I think it's important to realize the distinction between the prosecutor's theory which he propounded in his closing argument versus the evidence that the jury actually heard at trial from the State's own blood spatter expert that suggested in order for -- for Klein to have been moved from the point where the blood pool had formed onto the couch where his body was discovered by the police, there would have been some trail or some indicia, some evidence that would have suggested that he had to have been moved from that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.138" offset="5273955">And the more important question, I suppose, would be, as the dissenting opinion pointed out in this case: Why would the victim have been moved if he had been shot at that location?</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.303" offset="5602680">As the dissenting opinion points out, it certainly was -- there's no evidence in the various experts' declarations that suggests, first of all, why the jury would have believed Respondent's trial testimony that after having essentially partied with the two victims for several hours the night before, they suddenly leave, go back to their place of employment, come back two hours later to return property and a firearm to another occupant of the house that they had no reason to believe was actually there; then they are suddenly surprised by these two victims; that there -- there is a spontaneous gunfight that ensues involving a firearm that's never found, that's never attributed to either of the two victims in the house, that could have only been attributable to the Respondent himself?</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.723" offset="5824303">So the jury had all of that evidence to consider, and balance that against these -- as I, again, described them -- inconclusive and speculative expert opinions that are proffered in support of Respondent's habeas petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1560.256" offset="6346439">The Court has invited briefing in the additional question presented on the application of AEDPA in this case, and in light of the Court's many questions this morning, I want to address that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.342" offset="6378830">But I did want to clear up one piece of information that seems to be confusing in the record, and if I can start with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.598" offset="6407774">This was in response, I think, to a question you asked, Justice Ginsburg, regarding the -- the prejudice prong of the Strickland claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.669" offset="6436091">And the question was: Why is it -- why is it not -- why is it harmless?</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.221" offset="6450301">And counsel suggested that there was an absence of blood between the blood pool and the couch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.525" offset="6467542">Detective Bell testified to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.893" offset="6476946">And I just want to clear up, because I know this -- this bit was confusing in the briefs, too: That is not what Detective Bell testified to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.047" offset="6505576">If you look at pages 181 and 195 in the reporter's transcript in Exhibit R 5, you will see that Detective Bell says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.034" offset="6533580">"Yes, there were drops leading away from the couch; yes, there were drops leading away from the blood pool. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1858.281" offset="7538563">Only your expert knows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.566" offset="7543683">What Bell does talk about, however, is that there's a high-velocity blood splatter in front of the couch and that the pooling of blood on Klein's face shows that he was shot there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.743" offset="7604391">Your experts do nothing to refute that testimony, which was really the basis of Bell's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.051" offset="7645665">He had nothing to say about the pool of blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.884" offset="7656950">He talked about why Klein was shot where he was shot.</text>

            <text syncTime="1893.788" offset="7680564">So how do you get past there being a reasonable probability of a different verdict when there is nothing to refute the critical testimony at issue, that Klein was shot where he was shot because there's high-velocity blood splatter in front of him and because the pooling on his face shows that?</text>

            <text syncTime="1917.134" offset="7773978">Let's take both the high-velocity blood splattering and the pooling, Your Honor, but let me start with the predicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.169" offset="7790070">And you are right, Detective Bell did not testify at all about the formation of the blood pool, and that's why this case is not about anticipating the State's expert about the blood pool, but about getting your own for your own case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.708" offset="7832283">Turning to the specifics of your question, the high-velocity blood splatter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.196" offset="7850256">It actually wasn't in front of the couch, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.047" offset="7857570">It was to the side and below the arm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.597" offset="7867810">And let's remember Detective Bell's testimony about how the homicide occurred, because the State's theory was not that Pat Klein was shot while he was lying on the couch, but that he was sitting on the couch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.021" offset="7905531">And so what is most interesting about the high-velocity blood splatter, since he was shot in the head, is that there is none on the wall immediately behind the couch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.342" offset="7938759">This was a matter of some confusion in the briefs as well, but I think it's going to clear it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.579" offset="7955686">There is no high-velocity blood splatter behind on the pristine white wall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.131" offset="7973972">So the question is: If he is shot while sitting up, the high-velocity blood splatter that Bell testifies to travels, oh, about 4 feet over the couch, and then 2 drops sink down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.005" offset="8013469">Now, in terms of the jury evaluating that testimony, it's important to note that Detective Bell gave a description of what high-velocity blood splatter is, and he said it's a fan-like pattern of atomized blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.063" offset="8057668">And when you look at these 2 drops, these 2 drops alone that travel 4 feet and then drop straight down to fall on a plastic bag, you see, as defense counsel pointed out in his closing argument, that they are the same size as blood drops found in the kitchen on Exhibits R18 through R22.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.006" offset="8125482">And Detective Bell's entire theory for why these were high-velocity is their size.</text>

            <text syncTime="2169.278" offset="8782514">It has to do with the angle of his face after he's shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.713" offset="8792231">So if he's shot on the bedroom -- in the bedroom doorway and falls and that's the angle, the blood flow would be the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="2199.363" offset="8902886">Gunner Johnson could not have deposited that blood, because there was no satellite drops, which means it has to come from another source.</text>

            <text syncTime="2336.279" offset="9450517">He had given four or five different stories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.945" offset="9457204">And after all, he knew both Klein and Richter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.997" offset="9465459">When he first spoke to the 9-1-1 people, they said, What happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.766" offset="9480505">He said, 5 people came in and shot me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.516" offset="9487506">Then he said 4, then he said 3, and when they said "Who", he said, "I don't know".</text>

            <text syncTime="2391.163" offset="9670050">And in a sense, the ammo and the gun safe the answer is -- is very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.549" offset="9683634">All parties agreed in this case that several weeks before the incident, Gunner Johnson had stored all his belongings at my client's house.</text>

            <text syncTime="2409.041" offset="9741625">And this is one of the unusual features, is that the State's theory requires us to believe that this happened so he could rob a gun safe that had been at his house for weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.195" offset="9774226">The question was had -- had the material, the gun safe and the ammo, who's was it and had it been taken back to Gunner's house.</text>

            <text syncTime="2433.656" offset="9840055">Now, the record shows that Gunner Johnson had a shotgun, and Gunner Johnson was a drug dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.326" offset="9866700">So the defense theory, of course, is that this ammo wasn't my client's.</text>

            <text syncTime="2520.505" offset="10187483">When there is a credibility determination, when a defense -- any defense attorney lawyer worth his salt knows that there is a credibility determination to be made, the jury is going to believe either this story or my client's story, it at least behooves you to investigate to see if the physical evidence can support your position.</text>

            <text syncTime="2883.692" offset="11640205">They say going back to 1974, there are at least three cases in the Ninth Circuit that have said when the California Supreme Court says nothing, just denied, we take that as a decision to reach the Federal issue and deny it on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.887" offset="11708959">Now, not in your case, but in most cases that will benefit a defendant, because it will avoid the question of whether there's an adequate and independent State ground of a procedural nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.195" offset="11762249">So, what they are saying is that that's the Ninth Circuit's statement in three cases, and the California Supreme Court over a course of 30 years has never said to the contrary, which it had plenty of opportunity to do and in other instances where the Ninth Circuit was wrong, it did do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.775" offset="11836541">So, that, I think, is a fairly strong argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.310" offset="11850648">Now, you're going to -- the only reason that you are not out of court on your own interpretation is because you will say that the State waived the procedural issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2954.170" offset="11922119">It is true that the Ninth Circuit has had this process, this procedure for a long time, and of course a development of pre-AEDPA world when the fact that whether something was on the merits or not didn't really matter, the only question was, was it defaulted, and if it was defaulted it might bar Federal review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.399" offset="11999023">Whether it was on the merits was really irrelevant because before 2254(d) that really didn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.517" offset="12015532">So that's where, and I agree with the State that's where those cases come from.</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.972" offset="12369335">In Ylst v. Nunnemaker that's exactly what the Ninth Circuit said and it came to this Court and the State actually argued that it wasn't on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.309" offset="12402667">And indeed this Court held that you cannot tell from a silent denial whether it's on the merits or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3540.881" offset="14268959">I think it's important to remember Respondent's counsel talked about whether or not this spatter would have consistent with having been shot on the couch if there were blood spatter behind the armrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.337" offset="14310755">What the detective testified to and what is described in our brief is the detective said because this was not a through and through exit wound -- that is, the bullet lodged in the victim's head -- that the spatter would have been what he described as back spatter, meaning the blood would have flown out from the victim's head outward, and that was consistent with what the evidence was at the crime scene that the detective observed when he was there after the murder was committed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3582.022" offset="14433531">The detective described those as essentially insignificant; they didn't reflect anything other than someone was moving around in the house, which was consistent with what the crime scene investigators had discovered when they first responded to the 911 call from the -- Mr. Johnson to the police.</text>

            <text syncTime="3598.734" offset="14500404">Is there any reason not to do this?</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.317" offset="14506674">I am just thinking from our point of view -- I mean, I think it is probably correct what you say; nobody mentioned a word about this procedural issue until the brief in opposition on the merits, not the cert brief; and the reason they did was perfectly legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.427" offset="14567173">We'd asked the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.327" offset="14570726">Well, if we were wrong to do that, and if we took the opinion as being a question of reasonable deference, et cetera, and went into it, is there anything -- any reason not to put in that opinion somewhere, given Ylst and given the Ninth Circuit, it would be helpful if the California Supreme Court for future reference explained what their practice does in fact mean, whether it's procedural or whether it's on the merits.</text>
