            <text syncTime="10.869" offset="148940">In this case we find ourselves in the happy situation of having to try to convince the Court that its prior decisions were correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.161" offset="178092">Just 5 years after the enactment of FELA, the Court declared that it was obvious that the statute contained a proximate cause requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.345" offset="210798">The Court went on to repeat that conclusion over and over again in almost two dozen decisions over the next 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.904" offset="237025">Our submission this morning is that the Court when it made these statements got it right.</text>

            <text syncTime="43.464" offset="279239">It's just a different proximate cause than we see in other -- in other torts cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="56.781" offset="332528">And in the Court's initial decisions, the ones that I referred to, it stated very clearly that the ordinary proximate cause rule applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.044" offset="357606">The -- the proximate cause test that the Court stated in cases like Brady was the traditional proximate cause standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="68.666" offset="380071">Can you read the cases as indicating that more deference is given to juries in FELA cases than in other cases?</text>

            <text syncTime="75.318" offset="406716">Well, that -- that's -- is a separate one from the one we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.051" offset="421658">I mean, we are talking here about the nature of the -- the elements of the cause of action that have to be demonstrated by -- by the plaintiff; and so there -- the question of how much of that evidence there has to be to get to the jury is a separate question that's not presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.029" offset="481531">Our submission, since you posed the question, is that there is no different standard; that FELA was not intended to depart from the ordinary common law procedural approaches in that respect, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.477" offset="523327">But on the question that's presented--</text>

            <text syncTime="109.334" offset="542762">--I -- I wouldn't want to commit myself to answering that question affirmatively, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.486" offset="563346">The Court has said that -- that FELA was enacted to address particular problems in the administration of the common law prior to 1908.</text>

            <text syncTime="124.952" offset="605247">It also said that there's a relaxed standard of causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.468" offset="623323">I think that's what Justice Kennedy is referring to when he said "proximate cause light".</text>
            <text syncTime="136.183" offset="650177">But we have said in more than one case that there is a relaxed standard of causation in FELA cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.928" offset="681106">Was that wrong?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="145.207" offset="686226">I think there are two ways to respond to that, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.940" offset="705139">The first is that up until the Rogers decision, which is -- which is one of the ones which has created I think some confusion in this area, the Court was quite clear and unambiguous that proximate cause in FELA applied in the ordinary sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.670" offset="752055">As I say, in cases like the Brady case the Court stated what proximate cause means; it stated in -- in entirely traditional terms that -- that the plaintiff had to demonstrate that the injury followed in a natural, probable foreseeable way from the wrongful conduct, and so that -- that was the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.505" offset="819451">The Rogers case, which was the source of some of the confusion in this area, in our view, as -- as we think Justice Souter correctly demonstrated in his opinion in Sorrell, and as we explain at some length in our brief, Rogers we think did not address causation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.625" offset="875875">The Rogers case was a situation in which there were a multiplicity of causes, and the question was what -- what should -- should the rule be when there are a number of -- of entities that contribute to the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.056" offset="925612">It had nothing to do with remoteness or directness of the cause, what we usually think about when we talk about proximate cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.681" offset="944107">In -- in the years since Rogers was decided, when the Court -- got out of the business of deciding FELA cases on the facts, it had not had occasion on -- in any case to address specifically what proximate cause meant in the FELA context.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="237.216" offset="1054239">That -- that comes from, Wsubmit, from sort of a loose description of what was going on in the Rogers case, which involved a multiplicity of causes rather than directness and remoteness of causes, and so the cases in which that language appears, which are the Crane case and the Gottshall case, did not involve causation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.004" offset="1129472">The question of causation was not presented to the Court in those cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.453" offset="1183284">There are a number of cases with reverse dissents that seem to -- to say just that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="276.839" offset="1212750">Well, that -- that goes to the question that Justice Kennedy raised at the outset, which is how much evidence, whatever the standard of causation is, how much evidence must there be to go to the jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="286.291" offset="1250576">And our presentation here is that FELA did not change the ordinary standard on -- on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.989" offset="1281400">But that -- but that is not the question that's presented in this case.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="295.927" offset="1289132">Well, what -- can you explain to me -- I mean, here the judge charged in the words of the statute, and they are also the words used in the model Federal instruction: Did plaintiff's injury result in whole or in part from the railroad's negligence?</text>
            <text syncTime="313.154" offset="1357991">You would say: Was plaintiff's injury proximately caused.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.544" offset="1379621">And as you no doubt know, Mr. Rothfeld, that term "proximate cause", it just loses juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.101" offset="1409818">So considering that these cases go to the jury, what do you say to the instruction that's now given, based on the words of the statute,</text>
            <text syncTime="336.052" offset="1449629">"Did plaintiff's injury result in whole or part from the railroad's negligence? "</text>

            <text syncTime="344.733" offset="1484319">Well, I think there are -- there are two parts to your question, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.419" offset="1507098">One -- one is, what's wrong with the instruction that was given here; and the other is can juries understand proximate cause as a concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.496" offset="1535415">On -- on the first point, we have no objection to the instruction containing the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.634" offset="1559970">The problem is that to be comprehensible and intelligently applied by jurors, it has to say more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.305" offset="1578674">Proximate cause we submit is an element of the cause of action and that has to be explained to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.209" offset="1594243">It couldn't be the case in a Sherman Act case, for example, that a judge could simply charge the jury: You are to determine whether there has been an unreasonable restraint of trade; now go to the jury room and answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.141" offset="1633949">There is a lot more that has to go into that cause of action, including, as it happens, proximate cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2422.835" offset="9796796">But what the court had also done was to rely on earlier cases in which it's saying these concepts really are relaxed because the purpose of FELA is to provide a substitute, if you will, for workers' compensation, where if you can establish negligence on the part of the railroad and it causes, in part, the injury, the railroad will be liable for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.546" offset="9879656">And that's why this -- these concepts of proximate cause really are getting at a different problem, which is that when these statutes are enacted, you're trying to guard the defendant's liability against the entire world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.259" offset="9930439">And that's why it makes sense to impose some kind of restriction for foreseeability or for directness, because otherwise anybody could be liable to anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.705" offset="9972234">Here, that problem is removed, because the railroad is the only -- can only be sued, under FELA, by the employee, and only if its negligence plays a role in producing that injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2491.729" offset="10072336">So it would be very odd to think that you would reverse an instruction here, where the proffered instruction by the railroad doesn't even State what -- the proximate cause instruction in the model language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.941" offset="10129178">Now the model language under Illinois calls for the natural and ordinary course of events.</text>

            <text syncTime="2832.741" offset="11436345">And so the result is that railmen know they're going to have to go before juries exercising their common sense, and juries have, in many, many cases, ruled in favor of the railroads.</text>

            <text syncTime="2853.857" offset="11520878">We believe that because Rogers construed the "in whole or in part" language, it's entitled to statutory stare decisis where jury instructions have used that language.</text>

            <text syncTime="2947.959" offset="11897250">And then subsequently when the Court in Ayers and then in Gottshall says very clearly these are ways that FELA has departed from the common law and from the other statutes, in Gottshall the Court was very clear that it is relaxed causation and that this is one of the departures from normal common law standards.</text>
