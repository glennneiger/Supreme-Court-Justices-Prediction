            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the -- to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.571" offset="136694">Janus Capital Group, a publicly traded company created Janus Investment Fund, a collection of mutual funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.661" offset="169085">Janus Investment Fund then hired Janus Capital Management or JCM wholly on subsidiary of Janus Capital Group, to be its investment advisor and administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.634" offset="224987">As required by statute, Janus Investment Fund filed prospectuses with the Securities Exchange Commission for its mutual funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.959" offset="270232">Some of the -- those pros -- prospectuses suggested that JCM would implement policies against market timing, a trading strategy that can harm investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.192" offset="323208">When it came to light that JCM permitted Market Timing, investors withdrew money from the Janus Investment Fund, mutual funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.970" offset="370333">Janus Capital Group stock price also plummeted.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.587" offset="392798">Respondents, stockholders of Janus Capital Group sued Janus Capital Group and JCM under SEC Rule 10b-5 which makes it unlawful to make any untrue statement of material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.245" offset="483391">The stockholders alleged that -- that the companies have made material untrue statements by participating in the writing and dissemination of the prospectuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.829" offset="533755">The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.123" offset="554966">But the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed holding that the stockholders had alleged sufficient facts claimed that both companies had made misleading statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.985" offset="606375">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for purposes of Rule 10b-5, the maker of a statement is a person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement including its content and whether and how to communicate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.266" offset="691534">Here, even if JCM assisted with the drafting of the prospectuses, they were Janus Investment Fund's prospectuses and that company had ultimate authority over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.001" offset="742421">Janus Investment Fund, not JCM or Janus Capital Group made the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.128" offset="770947">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan joined.</text>
