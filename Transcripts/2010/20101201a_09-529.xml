            <text syncTime="1731.773" offset="7033543">Because remember, on the issue of waiver and abrogation, that was litigated below and no waiver was found, and that wasn't appealed against.</text>

            <text syncTime="1809.172" offset="7343146">The second thing is, what the State consented to is it waived its sovereign immunity to be sued, but it did not specify a suit in Federal court and under ordinary doctrine that's a consent to be sued in its own courts, not in Federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3453.919" offset="13922137">First, we don't think that a State AG or State agency could sue a governor if State law prohibited it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.775" offset="13957559">The question of capacity to sue, the power to sue is one of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.429" offset="13976158">What we're saying here is that if a suit could go forward between two State agencies, between State agency and State officials in State court, and if that case involved a Federal issue, it can be heard in Federal court if the other requirements of Article III and Ex parte Young are being met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.640" offset="14048987">Second, there was some suggestion that Ex parte Young is only about citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.294" offset="14071662">But this Court's applied Ex parte Young to Indian tribes, allowing them to sue State officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.679" offset="14089112">It's allowed foreign countries to use Ex parte Young to sue State officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.067" offset="14106666">And the Respondents concede that political subdivisions, which can also be eliminated at will by the State, could use Ex parte Young.</text>

            <text syncTime="3560.939" offset="14350232">And that brings me to the third point, which is this notion of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.224" offset="14363293">We are not arguing here that they have waived their sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.794" offset="14377608">What we are claiming is that they don't have sovereign immunity to these injunctive suits against the State officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.781" offset="14401536">We are not seeking damages and we haven't named the State in its own name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.816" offset="14413657">But what we are suggesting is that it was the natural consequence as this Court decided in Frew, that when you, you know, accept the Federal money and you are bound by Federal duties and that the entity that you give the Federal right to has a Federal -- has a right to sue, that the Federal issues, Federal issues will be litigated in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.016" offset="14506548">And I would say particularly that here just, of course Virginia renews every year to take the Federal money, but when it last amended the Federal statute or the State statute to create VOPA in its current structure, there were existing Ex parte Young suits against State officials.</text>
