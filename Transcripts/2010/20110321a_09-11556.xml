            <text syncTime="9.710">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.453">The Court held in Delaware v. Prouse that, in the absence of reasonable suspicion, it is an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment for police to stop a car for the purpose of checking the motorist's driving credentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.332">In Brown v. Texas, the Court similarly ruled that police may not stop a person without reasonable suspicion for the purpose of requiring the individual to identify him or herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.285">These cases are grounded in the principle that in this country we enjoy the right to go about our business free from government interference unless or until the police have just cause to detain us.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.118">Petitioner's motion to suppress alleged that the police acted exactly as they did in Prouse and Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.182">They stopped the car without justification, elicited his name, and gained access to his DMV records, which otherwise would not have been discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.089">Instead of suppressing the poisonous fruit of the illegal car stop, the DMV records, the New York Court of Appeals chose to create a new categorical rule that prevents application of the exclusionary rule whenever the police act in violation of Prouse.</text>

            <text syncTime="106.245">What -- what -- what new information came from the stop was the fact that that is the person who was driving the car.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.001">The officer sees him getting into a car and driving away, even though his license is still suspended.</text>

            <label>Ms. Kristina Schwarz</label>
            <text syncTime="198.241">Well, although that initial stop provided the tainted information that he didn't have a license, the subsequent reoffense would certainly taint the -- the illegality of the first stop and make the second offense properly--</text>

            <text syncTime="216.713">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.046">Let me ask a related question.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.192">Suppose that after you filed your suppression motion the -- the State of New York became nervous about this issue and they checked all the surveillance cameras in the vicinity of the stop, and, lo and behold, they found a tape showing Mr. Tolentino driving the car shortly before the stop here.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.209">Could he be prosecuted for illegal -- for driving without a license, with a suspended license, using that evidence?</text>

            <label>Ms. Kristina Schwarz</label>
            <text syncTime="245.137">--Well, that -- I believe that under those circumstances it would be entirely proper to prosecute the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.914">With that, that would be evidence that came from an independent source.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="257.923" stopTime="273.598">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="257.923">Well, I mean, in light of those two answers, it does seem to me that your real problem here is not with the -- the DMV records.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.868">It's with the police officer's observation after the stop that Mr. Tolentino was driving the car.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kristina_schwarz" startTime="273.598" stopTime="300.929">
            <label>Ms. Kristina Schwarz</label>
            <text syncTime="273.598">Well, Justice Alito, again, all of -- there's lots of evidence that could be properly the fruit of the poisonous tree.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.163">There was a statement made here that the Petitioner said that he did not have a New York State license, there's the observations of the officer, and there's the DMV records.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.736">They're all properly considered fruit, and in this case the DMV records are of important evidentiary significance.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="300.929">Is there -- is there any case in this Court where what was suppressed was information that was lawfully in the government's possession, as opposed to evidence that was acquired originally through the search?</text>
            <text syncTime="321.160">Here we have the DMV records, they're public records.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.557">I don't know of any decision of this Court that deals with suppression of evidence that is already in the government's possession, and if I'm wrong about that, you tell me.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kristina_schwarz" startTime="338.086" stopTime="395.555">
            <label>Ms. Kristina Schwarz</label>
            <text syncTime="338.086">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.882">Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe there has been precedent on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.688">However, in the independent source doctrine cases, there -- they've always required that the possession -- or that they have knowledge of the information in order for it to defeat the exclusionary rule application.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.362">So in this case, although the government had the DMV records -- well, first of all, law enforcement didn't have the DMV records.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.360">It was only until the illegality and the exploitation of that illegality that they acquired the records from the Department of Motor Vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.537">So in that sense it was clearly a fruit of the poisonous tree.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.009">But even if you look at government as an integrated whole, the prior possession of the -- the records was meaningless, of no value to them, until the illegality when it acquired its meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="3135.938">And -- and -- and even my friend on the other side conceded that if it were an -- an outstanding arrest warrant such as in your hypothetical that would lead to of the name, even if the name were a fruit of an illegal stop or search, that that arrest warrant would still provide a basis to arrest the defendant and prosecute the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.001">Now, it may be that other fruits that are discovered in the home or statements taken from the defendant in the home would be suppressed, but certainly the prosecution could proceed under the Ker-Frisbie Rule, and any preexisting evidence that this person was an axe murderer or whatever else evidence that the government had would certainly still be admissible in the prosecution for whatever.</text>

            <text syncTime="3239.137">Suppose the police start stopping people and rather than asking for your name, they take a blood sample, they prick your finger, and then they take that blood and they look in their very extensive DNA databases, and they discover, oh, this is a guy who, you know, did these various terrible things, and start building cases.</text>

            <label>Mr. Pratik A. Shah</label>
            <text syncTime="3259.117">Your Honor, I think other types of biometric evidence that you suggest, for example, of blood evidence, might well implicate competing considerations that would dictate a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.738">And let me suggest a couple of the competing considerations, why I think the Court doesn't need to reach so far and say all sorts of biometric information should be treated the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.311">For -- for one -- for one thing, things like a name or even a fingerprint, this Court has said is not a separate Fourth Amendment event to acquire that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.719">For example, once someone is detained, it's not also a search to ask for their name or to take a fingerprint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.033">However, in your example, pricking someone with a needle to obtain their blood would be a separate Fourth Amendment event, because that would be a separate invasion of their -- of their bodily integrity, privacy, and that might warrant different considerations, since there are two violations there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.375">There might be a need for greater deterrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.754">I think the other sort of consideration that might be implicated in -- in that type of hypothetical is that evidence unlike a name or fingerprint, DNA evidence, for example, that you suggest, might provide competing considerations in the sense that it could lead to other types of information that not -- that may not be relevant to the criminal justice system, medical records, genetic information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.744">It may pose a specter of other competing considerations that might require a different balance in the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.929">I think it would be premature for this Court to weigh in one way or another as to whether that would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.818">I think we would need a record and we would want time to -- to -- to -- we would want that to play out and see -- and see what the consequences were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.845">So I don't think the Court has to go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.991">I think the Court can limit it, as in this case, to name, fingerprints and other traditionally -- other information traditionally used to identify a defendant.</text>

            <label>Ms. Kristina Schwarz</label>
            <text syncTime="3374.194">I would first just like to address Justice Breyer's concern about what the rule should be, and -- excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.860">So long as there's sufficient causal relationship between the Fourth Amendment violation and the later discovery of evidence, this Court has expressed continued allegiance to this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.952">So in this case the reason why the DMV records are suppressible fruit is it fits that classic definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.767">Why are the observations suppressible when the identity isn't?</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.377">That's another issue that was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.053">The observations are -- again, they fit the definition whereas the identity does -- does not fit that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.497">The Ker-Frisbie rule prevents a person himself from being suppressible, but the elicitation of his name is something entirely separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.645">So in other words, in the Crews case a majority of the Court said that a -- a person could not suppress their person or their face from being in court; five of the justices said that; but five justices said that the in-court identification could under certain circumstances be suppressible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.384">So they drew a distinction between the person's body being brought into court, which is not suppressible because of the Ker-Frisbie rule, and then the evidentiary use of the identity, the fact that the five of the justices said that in certain circumstances not applicable in that case, the in-court identification could be suppressible shows the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.448">And that's the distinction that has been -- is confusing about this case, because the elicitation of his name is what led to the DMV records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.642">But even if this Court found that the elicitation of the name was not sufficient or was somehow related to Ker-Frisbie and could not be suppressible, the DMV records directly flow from the Fourth Amendment violation here, from the Prouse violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.225">And so it really doesn't really matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.120">Especially in light of the decision in Whren to remove subjective motivations from the determinations of constitutional reasonableness in car stops, it's essential to enforce what remains of motorists' core Fourth Amendment rights; and the Whren standards just must be enforced; otherwise these core Fourth Amendment values will be undermined and police will be left free to stop people on the roads with no objective basis and check their ID and status and do fishing expeditions into this sea of data that will be linked to the police computers; and this would violate Prouse and Brown and Hiibel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3550.908">Well, again, this is a classic case where there's a clear relationship, a causal relationship, so this is the sort of case where this Court has continued allegiance to application of the exclusionary rule where the exclusionary rule is very strong; and so why would the Court say that the second sister of the exclusionary rule, in this circumstance where there's sufficiently deliberate, that exclusion would be meaningful and sufficiently culpable, that the evidence would be -- that application of the rule would be worth the cost?</text>
