            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">South Carolina's family court sometimes enforces its child support orders by holding in civil contempt, and potentially imprisoning for up to one year, those whom the Court has ordered to pay child support, and who can but do not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.035" offset="188562">Applying that law, the South Carolina Court sent petitioner Michael Turner to prison for up to a year, or until he paid the child support he owed, whichever came first.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.165" offset="233075">Turner, who says he is indigent, had no lawyer at a civil contempt hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.371" offset="253868">And he's asked us to decide whether the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause requires the State to provide with counsel at a civil contempt hearing an indigent person potentially faced with imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.210" offset="313219">Now, this is a civil case, and traditionally, a person imprisoned for civil contempt, for violating a court order can be released by complying with the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.544" offset="354597">Its slogan is, he "carries the keys of his prison in his own pocket."</text>
            <text syncTime="67.736" offset="375390">Still, an indigent may find it difficult to comply with an order to pay child support and for that reason, might have a defense to the contempt charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.471" offset="414260">But is he indigent, so that he cannot pay?</text>
            <text syncTime="81.440" offset="430143">Turner says he should have a lawyer to help him answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.134" offset="448951">In reaching our conclusion, we balanced several relevant interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.633" offset="466923">Turner has an obviously strong interest on his side, namely that accuracy in respect to his financial status is especially important, because he is threatened with prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.905" offset="516033">But three other factors, which we explain in detail in our opinion, lead us to conclude that nonetheless, a defendant in Turner's position is not automatically entitled to a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.248" offset="565352">First, although the issue of ability to pay is important, it will often be fairly easy to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.731" offset="595341">Even in a criminal case, a defendant who won't yet a have a lawyer has to provide information that shows that he's indigent before he can insist that the state give him a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.266" offset="645496">Second, what about the other parent who has owed child support?</text>
            <text syncTime="139.916" offset="664095">Sometimes, the person who stands the benefit from child support enforcement is not the state but the other parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.169" offset="693039">And that parent, say the mother, maybe relatively poor, unemployed, and be unable to afford counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.063" offset="724699">In such a case to give a lawyer to only one side, say the father, but not to the mother, could make the proceeding taken as a whole, less fair, not more fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.350" offset="773810">Third, at the same time, we believe there are alternative procedures that could protect the defendant's rights with less risk of unnecessarily depriving the family of the child support payments that they need.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.385" offset="829921">As the Solicitor General has pointed out, those alternatives include, notice to the defendant that his ability to pay is a very important issue, the use of a form or some other equivalent to elicit relevant financial information, an opportunity at the hearing for the defendant to respond to follow up questions, say by the judge, and an expressed finding by the Court whether the defendant does, or does not have the ability to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.505" offset="954368">We conclude that where as here the custodial parent, here, is the child's mother, is not represented by a counsel, the state need not provide counsel to Turner be a noncustodial parent who is supposed to pay the child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.087" offset="1016748">But we attach important caveat, namely that the State must nonetheless have in place alternative procedures that assure a fundamentally fair determination of the critical question, whether the father was or was not able to comply with the support order.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.682" offset="1091145">Here, South Carolina provided neither counsel nor alternative procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.844" offset="1115805">Thus, Turner's proceedings were constitutionally defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.833" offset="1131687">We vacate the judgment of the South Carolina Supreme Court and we remand the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.871" offset="1155929">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting Opinion in which Justice Scalia joins and in which the Chief Justice and Justice Alito join as to Parts I-B and II.</text>
