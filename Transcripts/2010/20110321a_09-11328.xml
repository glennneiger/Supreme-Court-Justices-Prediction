            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105241">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-11328, Davis v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.480">Mr. Kerr.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Orin S. Kerr</label>
            <text syncTime="8.298">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.823">This case raises the intersection of two similar doctrines of the same vintage that point in exactly opposite directions: The first, retroactivity; and the second, the good faith exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.777">This Court should reverse and hold that the good faith exception does not apply to reliance on precedent, and instead, that should be governed by the retroactivity principles of Griffith v. Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.184">I think it's helpful to start with Linkletter v. Walker, the 1965 decision that introduced the concept of retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.894">Linkletter held that Mapp v. Ohio, which had held that the exclusionary rule applied to State violations of the Fourth Amendment, is not retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.368">The Linkletter decision was premised on a simple syllogism: The exclusionary rule is about deterrence; a decision that postdates a search cannot deter the police; and therefore, the exclusionary rule should not be available in cases before Mapp.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.294">Linkletter's syllogism is the same syllogism that the Court is attempting -- that, sorry, the government is attempting to rely on in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.524">History has shown that that syllogism is powerful in the context of collateral review and habeas corpus proceedings, but it should not apply on direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.264">It should not apply on direct review for two basic reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.440">First, because on direct review the first case must be treated like other cases on direct review, the exclusionary rule must be available in order to protect the adversary process and avoid advisory opinions, which--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="102.986">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.536">You lose me in the argument because it doesn't seem to me that we -- if we did apply the good faith rule, we would be denying retroactive effect to the altered judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.208">It continues to apply to matters beforehand, but it's a totally different question whether, assuming it is retroactive, the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.929">It's a -- it's a separate question from retroactivity, it seems to me.</text>

            <label>Mr. Orin S. Kerr</label>
            <text syncTime="141.902">--I disagree, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.864">During the Linkletter period, the scope of the exclusionary rule for the Fourth Amendment was an essential concern in a series of retroactivity cases, Linkletter being the first, Desist v. United States being the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.197">There were -- many of the Linkletter era retroactivity cases were concerned with the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="163.928">Yes, but just to pursue Justice Scalia's point: The good faith rule is itself a rule that's intact, that's a precedent, that was on the books, and the good faith rule qualifies the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.798">So why aren't we just following the good faith rule here?</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="180.270">I mean, there's nothing retroactive or prospective about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.863">It's just -- it's just applying the existing law.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Orin S. Kerr</label>
            <text syncTime="185.872">--I disagree, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.668">It's not applying existing law, because the effect of what is labeled the good faith exception in this setting is actually to apply the prior decision; that is, to have all of the substance and effect of a retroactivity decision.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="201.168">Well, that's an application of -- that's a subset, it's one application, of the good faith rule, which is an overall principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.945">But we're being faithful, under the government's view, it seems to me, to the overall principle.</text>

            <label>Mr. Orin S. Kerr</label>
            <text syncTime="214.917">I think the Court needs to take away the labels here.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.889">The government is using a label of good faith for what is essentially a retroactivity argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="223.794" stopTime="253.452">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="223.794">It's not a label at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.490">You're -- we're not denying the application of the altered rule to your client's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.888">It applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.601">But the question of whether, when it does apply, the good faith disregard of it by a police officer nonetheless allows the evidence to be admitted, it's a totally different -- we're giving full retroactive effect to the -- to the change in the law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="orin_s_kerr" startTime="253.452" stopTime="270.711">
            <label>Mr. Orin S. Kerr</label>
            <text syncTime="253.452">At the same time, Justice Scalia, whatever rule is applied in this case would have to be the same rule that applies in Gant itself, and without the incentive of counsel to argue in favor of the change in the law, that would block claims by defense attorneys to overturn the precedents of this Court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="270.710" stopTime="299.802">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="270.710">Well, Mr. Kerr, our cases have talked about the deterrence impact on police conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.729">It seems to me you're trying to expand that notion to cover incentives for defendants, and as I read -- I guess it's Leon, in footnote 25, it says the argument that defendants will lose their incentive to litigate meritorious Fourth Amendment claims as a result of a good faith exception is -- is unpersuasive.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="orin_s_kerr" startTime="299.802" stopTime="323.921">
            <label>Mr. Orin S. Kerr</label>
            <text syncTime="299.802">Leon, I think, raised a different setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.524">It raised the question of reliance on errors by a magistrate judge, which simply does not implicate the concerns of retroactivity, which is this Court changing its interpretation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.060">I think that raises a distinct set of principles, as Justice Harlan recognized in his dissent in Desist and his separate opinion--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="323.921">Well, I think our -- our theory on the exclusionary rule across the board, without regard to the underlying substantive violation, is that you look to deterrence of police conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.874">And here, I mean -- I mean, you agree the police did nothing wrong in this case, don't you?</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="339.983">So what impact -- why do we want to deter them from doing what's right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="orin_s_kerr" startTime="344.985" stopTime="364.752">
            <label>Mr. Orin S. Kerr</label>
            <text syncTime="344.985">Because it takes two branches of government for the exclusionary rule to deter constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.253">The Court has to properly construe the Fourth Amendment and the police need to then properly follow the Court's precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.688">The Court can't turn away from the role of this Court's precedents in the enforcement of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="364.752" stopTime="393.927">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="364.752">Well, I understand your argument with respect to decisions of this Court, and I think that's your strongest argument, but would you concede that that argument does not apply when the precedent on which the police are relying is a decision of one of the courts of appeals or a State supreme court Fourth Amendment decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="385.333">In that situation, there will be plenty of avenues for obtaining review of the correctness of those decisions; isn't that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="orin_s_kerr" startTime="393.927" stopTime="426.907">
            <label>Mr. Orin S. Kerr</label>
            <text syncTime="393.927">Justice Alito, I think it depends on what the good faith exception is.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.066">The government's brief I think does not exactly articulate what the standard is that -- to which it would like to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.881">Even so, most Circuit Court decisions interpreting the Fourth Amendment are derivative of this Court's decisions interpreting the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.278">And this case is a good example.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.621">The facts of this case are quite similar to the facts of Belton.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.510">The Eleventh Circuit had not actually expanded upon Belton; it had merely had relatively routine applications of Belton.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="426.907" stopTime="439.693">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="426.907">Well, it applied its understanding of Belton, which turned out to be different from the understanding of the Arizona Supreme Court in Gant and the understanding of at least four members of this Court when Gant got here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="orin_s_kerr" startTime="439.693" stopTime="458.795">
            <label>Mr. Orin S. Kerr</label>
            <text syncTime="439.693">At the same time, the Eleventh Circuit's development of the law was -- went no further than Belton itself, and this Court needs adversaries to make forthright arguments to this Court which may involve distinguishing precedent and may involve overturning precedent.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="458.795" stopTime="486.423">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="458.795">If I could just come back to my question: Suppose you have a decision in one of the courts of appeals that says certain conduct is permitted under the Fourth Amendment, and the police in that circuit, Federal law enforcement officers in that circuit, follow that precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.803">Now, is -- will there not be plenty of opportunities to review the correctness of that decision because the issue may arise in other circuits where the matter isn't settled?</text>

            <label>Mr. Orin S. Kerr</label>
            <text syncTime="486.423">If this Court adopts a good faith exception that is quite narrow and would not allow an officer in one circuit to reasonably rely on the clear circuit court decisions of another circuit, that's certainly a possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.235">However, it's not clear as to why the Court would adopt such a narrow version of the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.040">The language that the government proposes, at least, seems to be the language of qualified immunity; the notion of reasonable reliance on a decision being believed to be lawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="517.160">Mr. Kerr, the line that has been suggested by Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy, that is exactly the line that the Eleventh Circuit took; is it not the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="528.530">I mean, Judge Kravitch said: Yes, the Fourth Amendment was violated, so to that extent we're following retroactivity precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.307">But the remedy is something different.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="546.668">And on your theory, I mean, there's another question in this case; that is, perhaps this evidence would come in under the inventory, as a -- as a legitimate inventory search, and if the Court decided that question, then -- then the question you're arguing, the exclusionary rule question, would have no practical consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.694">On your theory, the way you reasoned, shouldn't the Court first decide was this a legitimate inventory search, and if so, then we never get to any exclusionary rule question?</text>

            <text syncTime="597.952">It would remain for the Eleventh Circuit to apply that in the event the Court reverses.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.591">At the same time, I wish to be clear that I'm not arguing that the exclusionary rule is available in every case when the Court overturns its precedent, merely that it is a remedy in some cases, and I think it's actually a necessary cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.359">Why did this defendant have any incentive to bring his constitutional claim if, as may or may not appear too likely, the inventory search is going to result in the admission of the evidence anyway?</text>
            <text syncTime="633.812">It seems that your theory goes too far in saying that defendants will never have an incentive to bring a constitutional challenge if there's some other ground on which the evidence might be admitted, and that's never been our law.</text>

            <text syncTime="661.994">We take cases where you can bring a constitutional challenge or a different challenge all the time, qualified immunity cases, you know, what was the law and was it clearly established?</text>

            <text syncTime="680.845">Harmless error cases, the underlying violation, whether it's a harmless error, and the Court can decide the case on either ground, but that doesn't keep defendants from bringing the claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1488.857">Because the exclusionary rule has severe consequences for the truth-seeking function of a criminal trial, this Court has restricted its application to those situations in which it's necessary to further the deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule, namely to shape police conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.208">The Court has repeatedly rejected efforts to expand the exclusionary rule to serve other purposes, such as schooling judges who issue warrants on the need to respect the Fourth Amendment, reminding legislatures about their obligations under the Fourth Amendment, and for other purposes such as to preserve judicial integrity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1531.910">Gant severely qualified Belton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.529">Should there have been a suppression remedy for Gant, as Justice Kagan suggested, the very case that changes the law?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="1552.558">Justice Ginsburg, let me give two responses to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.317">First of all, the rule that the Eleventh Circuit adopted in this case, and that is the only rule before the Court, involves a situation in which there is binding appellant precedent that instructs the officer, tells the officer, what you're about to do complies with the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.409">The state of the law in Arizona would not necessarily have risen to that level, in light of the dissonance in that court's opinions, in the Arizona Supreme Court opinions, about the reach and scope of Belton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.492">So the question about whether the rule that we're urging here would have applied in Arizona is a separate question from the one that the Eleventh Circuit resolved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1595.232">Was Gant purely prospective or did Gant itself get the exclusionary rule?</text>

            <text syncTime="1603.176">Gant obtained relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.972">This Court granted certiorari in Gant limited to the Fourth Amendment question, and Arizona never raised any good faith exception to the exclusionary rule in that case, so the Court did not address the good faith issue.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="1618.721">The logic of our position would be that, to the extent that Gant was seeking Belton to be overruled, he would not be able to impugn the actions of the officers who relied on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.017">To the extent that he was doing what he actually did do and which this Court's opinion in Gant accepted, which is to say that the Gant opinion, that the Belton opinion did not resolve the fact pattern in Gant, he would not be automatically governed by the good faith exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.618">And as a result, Gant is really the best illustration of how unusual it is for a lawyer to come to this Court and say, please outright overrule a Fourth Amendment decision.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="1711.651">Certainly the Court would have Article III authority, because it's always free to limit, modify or abrogate one of its precedents, including a holding, if one issued from this decision, that the good faith rule applies when the Court overrules its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.856">Litigants can all the time be faced with impossible arguments under existing precedent, but that doesn't preclude this Court's Article III jurisdiction to adjudicate challenges to that precedent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1742.651">I assume if Petitioner says we should be able to overrule our prior substantive precedent, he should also logically say that we should be able to overrule our prior precedent regarding the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.660">So that whenever somebody wants to come up here to challenge prior precedent, he can just say: You know, Your Honors, we're asking you to overrule two cases: The first one, the substantive rule of Fourth Amendment law; and secondly, whether that -- that change in law can govern the action of the policeman who didn't realize that the law was going to be changed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.298">Now, this Court may prudentially be reluctant to take a case in which it knows that its resolution of the Fourth Amendment issue would not dictate a reversal of the judgment, even if the Fourth Amendment issue went in favor of the defendant, but it is not that dissimilar from the situation in qualified immunity, when there is no law on the books that governs an issue and a petitioner asks the Court to resolve the Fourth Amendment issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1874.996">There's something illogical about permitting that kind of difference to control the outcome of suppression.</text>

            <text syncTime="2813.725">Well, Justice Ginsburg, before the litigation that occurred in the wake of Gant, there was only one precedent on the books in any circuit that I'm aware of that had applied the -- in the Federal system -- that had applied a good faith rule to overrule judicial decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.947">That was United States v. Jackson in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.056">It's cited in the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.799">It happened in 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.558">So I think it's fair to say that prosecutors and government officials were not raising good faith exclusionary rule arguments in the cases that were held for Gant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.011">I don't believe that the United States had done so, and as a result, it was perfectly logical and in accordance with this Court's normal practice to grant, vacate, and remand those cases for further consideration under Gant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.807">But in the wake of Gant, courts began to think of the logic of Leon and Krull and this Court's recent decision in Herring v. United States and attempt to apply the logic of those decisions to a circumstance in which a police officer relies on a binding and governing appellate precedent, and they concluded that courts that announce precedents have every reason to expect that litigants will rely on them and that police officers will rely on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.128">Therefore, there is no deterrent purpose to be served by suppressing the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.599">It's all cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.312">And the cost would be that individuals whose convictions have been obtained based on evidence that was seized in reasonable good faith reliance on existing appellate precedent will now be able to overturn their convictions, and that's a heavy cost to the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.534">It's why the exclusionary rule has been confined to particularized circumstances where it's thought that it will actually achieve a benefit, and it has not been expanded beyond those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.420">So given that litigants, criminal defendants, have a tremendous incentive to challenge their convictions and to try to navigate around precedents while simultaneously showing that those precedents may have underlying material flaws, this Court is highly unlikely to be deprived of cases in which litigants attempt to undermine precedents without actually calling for their overruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.570">That is what happened, for example, in Batson v. Kentucky, where the Petitioner in that case did not want to head-on confront Swain v. Alabama and ask for its overruling, and as a result asserted that racially discriminatory peremptory challenges were invalid under the Sixth Amendment, rather than the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.420">This Court got the case and concluded that the proper analysis was the Equal Protection Clause and it accordingly overruled Swain in relevant part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.448">So it's highly unlikely that if, in fact, a precedent of this Court is beginning to fray around the edges and justices of this Court have written concurrences or dissents that explain that they no longer believe that the logic of that is sound, litigants will exploit those statements in an effort to narrow the precedent and ultimately expose its flaws, so that if this Court determines it can overrule the precedent, and it can do so even if the exclusionary remedy will not follow.</text>

            <text syncTime="3113.090">No, Justice Ginsburg, I would not submit to the Court that the United States necessarily agrees with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.905">I think that this case doesn't involve that problem and, as I said, there are contrary arguments that could be advanced based on this Court's description in Herring of the purpose of the exclusionary rule to reach conduct that is either reckless or intentional or at the least systematically negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.886">And, so, some day this Court may have to confront whether the narrow limitation that Judge Kravitch adapted -- adopted in her opinion is the correct rule of law versus a broader view that exclusion is only appropriate when the officers have engaged in truly culpable conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.107">But that's not a bridge that the Court needs to cross in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.163">It's not an argument that the United States is advancing for affirmance of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.385">This judgment can be affirmed simply by holding that the syllogism that the court of appeals adopted that, absent a deterrent purpose there is no basis for exclusion, there is no deterrent purpose here, that's sufficient to resolve this case and the Court can leave for another day, if it agrees with that proposition, whether the exclusionary rule should have any broader exception for good faith behavior.</text>

            <label>Mr. Orin S. Kerr</label>
            <text syncTime="3200.032">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.999">I would like to start with the costs -- or return to the costs here of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.550">First, the plain error doctrine is going to largely address the concerns that the government has in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.031">If this Court is seeking to limit the scope of the exclusionary rule when the Court overturns precedents under the plain error doctrine, if defendants don't raise a challenge to the search or seizure in their case there will be no relief available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.010">So therefore, the only possible relief that could be granted is for individuals that saw the issue, raised the issue, and that will, of course, include the individual who raises the claim in a case where the Court overturns its precedent, therefore avoiding any of the difficulties similar to that of retroactivity.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="3246.844">In -- in -- in one -- in one sense if we're talking about costs, the rule the government proposes is -- is defendant friendly, in that this Court may be more willing to impose stricter rules under the Fourth Amendment, if it knows that the good faith rule will protect against the -- the costs of -- of overturning the conviction.</text>

          <turn speaker="orin_s_kerr" startTime="3270.168" stopTime="3317.017">
            <label>Mr. Orin S. Kerr</label>
            <text syncTime="3270.168">That's exactly right, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.131">And, in fact, that exact argument was one of the reasons Justice Harlan concluded that the exclusionary rule should be available in the first case and on direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.491">The Court needs to be aware of the costs when it overturns precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.630">It should not depart from precedent lightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.239">And I think Gant is a good example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.018">Justice Alito's dissent nicely points out the very real costs of the shift from the Belton rule to the Gant rule, and if there were no costs in a regime of pure prospectivity, the Court would feel much more free to overturn its precedents because no one would actually be affected by the rule of any cases that are either on direct review or in the initial case or of those individuals whose convictions are already final.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="3317.017">But that could work to the benefit of defendants as a class, not the particular defendant?</text>

            <label>Mr. Orin S. Kerr</label>
            <text syncTime="3322.155">That works to the benefit of defendants as a class, absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.878">In fact, going back to the Linkletter era, that was one of the -- perceived as one of the benefits of Linkletter, that it freed the Court to overturn precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.821">But I think that is an improper consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.597">It is necessary for Fourth Amendment decisionmaking for the Court to accurately weigh the costs and benefits of any shift in the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.275">And so I think that the costs of the exclusionary rule in that setting are actually necessary costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.043">And I also think concerns of a windfall that are available to defendants are overstated because of the many doctrines that limit the scope of the exclusionary rule such as inevitable discovery or standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.680">Actually the only individuals who would receive the benefit of the exclusionary rule would be those individuals who were not searched in the first place if the Constitution were followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.117">So, those are individuals who actually did not receive -- will not receive a windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.209">They will essentially, if they were lucky enough to raise the issue, go back to the state that they were before the Constitution was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.133">And again, that's a limited group of people, and those are, I think, the necessary costs required by the basic norms of constitutional adjudication that Justice Harlan raised in his dissent in Desist v. United States, and I think in a lot of ways this case does return to those concerns of Justice Harlan, raised both in his Desist dissent and his separate opinion for the Court in Mackey v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.235">I also wanted to focus on how similar the issue is in this case to -- in the Linkletter era, if you read the Desist dissent, in particular Justice Harlan's dissent, it's clear that he's considering the issue of retroactivity to be about the scope of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.883">The Eleventh Circuit below had this idea that retroactivity is about the availability of a rule, but rules are not sort of ephemeral ideas that are available or not without any impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.799">It must be that if they are available, they are available independently of when they were announced and should be enforced accordingly.</text>
