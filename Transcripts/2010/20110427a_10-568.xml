            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Our last argument of the term is in Case 10-568, Nevada Commission on Ethics v. Carrigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.522" offset="147477">Mr. Elwood.</text>

            <label>Mr. John P. Elwood</label>
            <text syncTime="11.472" offset="151343">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.026" offset="169524">Neutral laws requiring official recusal for conflict of interest do not abridge free speech because a legislator's vote, however expressive, is not protected speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.281" offset="206514">It is, rather, a legally binding exercise of State power that he wields as an incident of public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.119" offset="233890">The Nevada Supreme Court concluded that Respondent did have a free speech right to vote, and that overrode the Nevada recusal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.458" offset="263252">For four reasons, that holding was error.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.327" offset="274745">First, since the earliest days of the Republic recusal rules have been understood to serve important interests unrelated to any views a legislator may want to express, by requiring disqualification when circumstances indicate that private interests may have affected his independence of judgment.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="58.103" offset="337857">The -- the -- the case is -- is presented to us with briefs that seem to pass in the night.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.156" offset="361994">Your emphasis was on whether or not there was a right to vote that's protected under the First Amendment, and -- which is what the Nevada court held and you're quite correct to address it.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.214" offset="406298">But the Respondent says: Well, this interest has a chilling effect on -- on protected speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.237" offset="442347">I think we have to reach both parts of that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.789" offset="456558">Do you -- DO you agree with me?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. John P. Elwood</label>
            <text syncTime="89.308" offset="462618">I think that the Court could simply address what the Nevada Supreme Court did and tell it whether it got it right or got it wrong, whether there's a speech interest, and what -- whether that is subject to strict scrutiny or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.914" offset="509116">But I think that, even though that argument I don't think was raised or passed on below, that the Court would have discretion to address that.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.185" offset="542135">I think it would give additional guidance to the Nevada Supreme Court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="112.304" stopTime="130.283">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="112.304" offset="554674">Well, if we -- if we say that intermediate scrutiny is the test, even under that test, certainly under that test, the regulation cannot chill speech any more than necessary to fulfill the governmental interests, even under the intermediate standard.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="130.283" stopTime="130.801">
            <label>Mr. John P. Elwood</label>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="130.801" offset="628652">And -- and it just seems to me it's difficult for it to just address the standard of proof without deciding the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.420" offset="651118">Maybe you're right.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.039" offset="653625">Maybe we can just answer the -- the question that was certified and -- and send it back, if -- if you prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.359" offset="678808">I'm not sure.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="144.308" stopTime="184.269">
            <label>Mr. John P. Elwood</label>
            <text syncTime="144.308" offset="682674">--I think -- I think you're right, Justice Kennedy, that it would provide more guidance to the Nevada Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.846" offset="700855">It would be a pretty narrow reversal and remand, assuming that the Court merely reached the speech question.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.416" offset="723111">But on the associational question, I think it's important to emphasize from the outset that I think this would have a negligible effect on association, because it simply would not apply all that frequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.356" offset="766892">In order for the recusal statute to apply, two circumstances have to be simultaneously met.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.526" offset="787477">First, there has to be a qualifying relationship which is close and ongoing, and simultaneously it must have the -- it must -- the third party must have a private, usually pecuniary, interest before that same legislator.</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="184.269" stopTime="205.683">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="184.269" offset="842543">As I understand the objection, it's not to the recusal rules in general, but it's to the vagueness of this particular one.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.958" offset="881204">As I understand it, there's no concern about the specific categories that were mentioned, like family member or employer.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="205.683" stopTime="207.099">
            <label>Mr. John P. Elwood</label>
            <text syncTime="205.683" offset="928120">That is correct, Justice--</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="207.099" stopTime="215.639">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="207.099" offset="933867">So we're dealing not with can you have recusal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.218" offset="950272">Everybody believes, yes, you can.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.837" offset="956750">It's the degree of specificity.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="215.639" stopTime="232.064">
            <label>Mr. John P. Elwood</label>
            <text syncTime="215.639" offset="967931">--Well, that was the basis of the holding of the Nevada Supreme Court, was that those implicated speech rights and that all of them would be subject to strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.395" offset="998964">So from the outset, we may all be agreed that the court below applied fundamentally too high a level of scrutiny.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="232.064" stopTime="241.772">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="232.064" offset="1033655">But the -- the objection to the statute on the grounds that it's vague doesn't go away simply because intermediate scrutiny applies, does it, assuming intermediate scrutiny?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="241.772" stopTime="267.553">
            <label>Mr. John P. Elwood</label>
            <text syncTime="241.772" offset="1072525">No, but I think that the -- our response to the vagueness argument is that Respondent concedes that the four categories for members of your households, relatives, employers, and business relationships are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.044" offset="1117560">He says that on page 2 of his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.746" offset="1124456">So the question is whether the "substantially similar" language gums up the works, essentially.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.067" offset="1145668">Now, "substantially similar" is a statutory phrase that has had to have been used by every State legislature in the country and by Congress.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="267.553" stopTime="275.426">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="267.553" offset="1175656">But not in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.939" offset="1181194">And you don't disagree that -- I forgot which brief told us that there's no State has a similar catch-all.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_p_elwood" startTime="275.426" stopTime="335.965">
            <label>Mr. John P. Elwood</label>
            <text syncTime="275.426" offset="1207108">Well, first, I would disagree with the characterization of it as a catch-all, because it only sweeps in relationships that are substantially similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.782" offset="1240545">But Seattle, for example, has a, what is a true catch-all, which sweeps in -- it applies</text>
            <text syncTime="295.323" offset="1286729">"whenever it could appear to a reasonable person having knowledge of the relevant circumstances that the covered individual's judgment is impaired because of either a personal or business relationship not covered under subsection A or B above. "</text>
            <text syncTime="306.345" offset="1330824">which lists the covered relationships,</text>
            <text syncTime="308.314" offset="1338661">"or a transaction or activity engaged in by the covered individual. "</text>
            <text syncTime="311.499" offset="1351408">So while Nevada may be the only statute that applies "substantially similar" to these four categories, it is not alone in that structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.022" offset="1385472">And I think more importantly, it is not anywhere close to alone in its breadth.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.676" offset="1404176">The New Jersey statute is I think, if anything, broader:</text>
            <text syncTime="328.378" offset="1418909">"A direct or indirect financial or personal involvement. "</text>
            <text syncTime="331.163" offset="1430089">There are numerous State statutes which apply to business associates.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="335.965" stopTime="361.849">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="335.965" offset="1449315">Well, I found this statute very difficult to understand, but maybe you can explain what's -- what I found a bit puzzling.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.070" offset="1481707">The statute talks about a commitment in a private capacity to the interests of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.874" offset="1500933">Now, I take it that that commitment doesn't have to be something contractual.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.159" offset="1518070">When you're talking about relatives, that would assume -- that that would include emotional commitments to the relatives who are listed; is that correct?</text>

            <label>Mr. John P. Elwood</label>
            <text syncTime="361.849" offset="1552865">I think it would include the things -- the same things that are covered by ordinary -- every other recusal statute, which is very close personal relationships and relationships that give rise to a financial interest on the -- for the public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.609" offset="1603856">And we're not talking about, you know--</text>

          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="376.842" stopTime="385.914">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="376.842" offset="1612737">Not -- not a financial interest of the public official, a financial interest of the -- the relative or the person who is substantially similar to a relative.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.130" offset="1645965">Or is that wrong?</text>

            <label>Mr. John P. Elwood</label>
            <text syncTime="385.914" offset="1649100">--Well, I think that in the case of the relative, yes, it's the financial interest of the relative, and that's why the very close personal relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.153" offset="1678043">But all of the other relationships for members of the household, who are presumably part of the same economic unit, and for employers, in whom the officer has obviously a very close financial interest and they're tied together, and for business relationships, all of those are to get at the financial interests of the officer, not of the third party.</text>

            <text syncTime="411.965" offset="1753276">Maybe if I give you an example it will be clearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.567" offset="1767696">Let's take somebody who is within the third degree of consanguinity.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.874" offset="1804894">Now, let's say a public officer is considering something that would affect everybody's property taxes in town or a measure that would affect the benefits or the wages of everybody who works for the town.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.384" offset="1866961">And this official has a second cousin whose property taxes would be affected or works for the town, and the second cousin's wages or benefits would be affected.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.977" offset="1929341">I think that the -- it would depend on a couple of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.012" offset="1945433">First of all, it is a covered relationship, the second cousin would be a covered relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.999" offset="1965390">And -- and I think the interest there I think would be the subject of some debate whether it is a private interest because it is a broadly shared interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.572" offset="2015754">But I suppose because his property taxes might increase, it would be a private interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.460" offset="2039265">There is still the question of whether a reasonable person under those circumstances would view his -- his judgment, his independence of judgment, as being materially affected.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="493.999" offset="2081374">Well, if I were a public officer I would find it very difficult to figure out whether a reasonable person would think that an effect on my second cousin's property taxes would require -- would materially affect my judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.040" offset="2129544">But it's even worse than that because of the "substantially similar".</text>
            <text syncTime="509.008" offset="2141456">So the public officer not only has to think about second cousins; the person has to think about everybody who is like a second cousin to him or her.</text>

            <text syncTime="520.982" offset="2189312">Well, the way that that has been defined, and this appears -- this is not just a Nevada Commission on Ethics interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.534" offset="2211568">This is what the legislature understood it to mean, if you look at the legislative history, when they added the statute in 1999.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.938" offset="2233198">What they were looking for by adding the "substantially similar" relationships were relationships that were substantially similar to household and substantially similar to family.</text>

            <text syncTime="3106.135" offset="12529936">That is worse than a fine, because a political activist wants to do both precisely because they care about the ultimate results.</text>
