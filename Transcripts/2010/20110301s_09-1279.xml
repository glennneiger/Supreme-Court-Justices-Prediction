            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">I have our opinion this morning in Case 09-1279 FCC versus AT&amp;T.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.516" offset="131490">This case started when the Federal Communications Commission conducted an investigation of AT&amp;T.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.674" offset="156150">In the course of that investigation, AT&amp;T turned over many internal documents to the FCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.992" offset="181436">CompTel, a trade association representing some of AT&amp;T's competitors, filed a request asking that the FCC give an access to those documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.605" offset="223859">CompTel filed its request under the Freedom of Information Act or FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.699" offset="244234">And under that Act, federal government agencies are required to make documents publicly available upon request unless the documents are covered by an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.772" offset="284463">There are nine such exemptions.One of which Exemption 7 is the one that issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.680" offset="312153">Exemption 7 applies to information that is complied for law enforcement purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.302" offset="334618">Exemption 7 sees specifically exempts from disclosure any such information if disclosing it “could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy”.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.913" offset="397103">AT&amp;T sought to block the disclosure of the documents it had turned over to the FCC arguing that Exemption 7(C) should protect its personal privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.367" offset="438899">The question presented in this case is whether corporations as opposed to just individuals can have personal privacy under Exemption 7(C).</text>
            <text syncTime="92.800" offset="476620">Now, AT&amp;T's primary argument is that the word “personal” is the adjective form of the word “person” and “person” is defined in the FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.233" offset="518311">For the purposes of the statute, Congress defined the word “person” to include corporations and various other entities because the statutes says that the word “person” extends to corporations, AT&amp;T argues, so should the word “personal” when used in the same statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.925" offset="589155">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.277" offset="594484">Adjectives often reflect the meaning of related nouns.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.834" offset="608799">A person who is charitable is one who is generous and benevolent, just as a charity is an institution that gives relief to needy persons and causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.805" offset="644639">But sometimes adjectives and nouns have disparate meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.272" offset="658536">For example, the adjective “corny” does not have any obvious connection to the noun “corn”.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.008" offset="681420">Now, AT&amp;T is right that “person” in the statute is defined to include corporations, but “personal” is not because “personal” is an undefined term in the statute, we look to its ordinary meaning and context.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.069" offset="733665">The ordinary meaning of “personal” does not include corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.660" offset="748084">We do not usually speak of personal characteristics, personal effects, personal correspondents, personal influence, personal tragedy as referring to corporations or other artificial entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.424" offset="799075">It's not that corporations do not have correspondent's influence or tragedies of their own, but then we do not use the word “personal” to describe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.762" offset="832512">In fact, we often use the word “personal” to mean just the opposite of business-related.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.410" offset="851111">We speak for example of personal expenses as opposed to business expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.393" offset="870964">In addition, don't forget that we are trying to figure out not just the reach of the term “personal” but of the phrase “personal privacy”.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.803" offset="900639">An adjective can take on a different meaning depending on the noun that it modifies.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.669" offset="920074">A golden cup is one made out of or colored like the metal, a golden boy is one who is talented, successful, charming and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.281" offset="950585">In the present context, it seems clear to us that “personal privacy” does not include corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.005" offset="977439">This Court has often referred to the term “personal privacy” as it is used in FOIA as protecting the privacy of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.692" offset="1008159">But we have no examples where a court has used that term to describe the privacy of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.458" offset="1035222">AT&amp;T argues that the Court has, in fact, recognized privacy interests of corporations in a variety of context such as under the Fourth Amendment and Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.466" offset="1075242">But the issue before us is a much narrower one.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.470" offset="1087258">This case is only about FOIA Exemption 7(C) nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.593" offset="1103768">The case as AT&amp;T cites from the other areas are too far field from the particular question that issue here to be of much help.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.130" offset="1137936">We hold that personal privacy in FOIA Exemption 7(C) does not include the privacy of corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.108" offset="1165834">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is therefore reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.428" offset="1183180">All members of the Court join the opinion to that effect except Justice Kagan who did not participate in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
