            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">This case concerns the 1-year limitation provision for filing a federal habeas petition under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.053" offset="166682">The statute provides that that one-year period is tolled by “a properly filed application for a State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim.”</text>
            <text syncTime="31.000" offset="230421">And the question here concerns the meaning of the phrase, "other collateral review."</text>
            <text syncTime="36.722" offset="253304">Specifically, the question here is whether a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law is an application for “collateral review” that tolls the limitation period.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.066" offset="302728">For the reason stated in the opinion filed today, we hold that the phrase "collateral review" in this provision means judicial review of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of the direct review process.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.987" offset="358421">The parties here agree that Rhode Island's motion to reduce sentence is not part of the direct review process, so we hold that it is an application for a collateral review that tolls the limitation period.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.685" offset="413174">We therefore affirm the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.981" offset="434385">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part.</text>
