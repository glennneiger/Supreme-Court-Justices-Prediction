            <text syncTime="9.106" offset="142858">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.141" offset="154979">The issue before you today, of whether or not police can impermissibly create exigent circumstances, arises from the improper suppression of reasonably seized evidence after a reasonable warrantless entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.817" offset="217673">The test set forth by the Kentucky Supreme Court is improper for several reasons, the first of which is that this Court has routinely held that the subjective intent of police officers when effecting a warrantless entry is irrelevant.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joshua D. Farley</label>
            <text syncTime="57.420" offset="336165">Well, the Kentucky Supreme Court's first prong of their test, and I believe it's in our petition appendix on page 26 -- I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.570" offset="440759">Their -- their discussion starts on page 44a and carries over to 46A.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.592" offset="484854">The first question of their test is whether or not the officers acted in bad faith in an attempt to purposefully evade the warrant requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="103.132" offset="519022">That didn't -- that didn't apply in this case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joshua D. Farley</label>
            <text syncTime="105.566" offset="528739">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.066" offset="530725">The second prong of the Kentucky Supreme Court's test is whether or not the actions of the Respondent in this case or the occupant of the home would have been foreseeable by the police officers before they knocked and announced their presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.992" offset="594463">Now, the problem with the foreseeability test--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="123.925" stopTime="133.197">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="123.925" offset="602196">Why is -- why is that subjective?</text>
            <text syncTime="126.110" offset="610868">Why isn't that, wouldn't it be foreseeable to a reasonable police officer similarly situated?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joshua D. Farley</label>
            <text syncTime="133.197" offset="639185">--Well, Justice Ginsburg, it -- it isn't directly a subjective inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.934" offset="658202">However, police officers are trained to expect and foresee illegal activity so that they may carry out the duties of their job in protecting the citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.640" offset="705014">So under a foreseeability test, a police officer will always foresee illegal activity in response to his actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.348" offset="743884">Be it walking down the street or knocking on your door, a reasonable officer will always foresee illegal activity, and for that reason, the Kentucky Supreme Court's test is completely unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.905" offset="790068">Several of the other circuits and the lower courts have adopted tests that also attempt to add an extra exception, an unwarranted closure of the exigent circumstances exception that narrows the use of that exception by police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.069" offset="870734">The test that the Commonwealth would propose is a simple lawfulness test.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.121" offset="890901">Now, under this test, as long as an officer behaves lawfully, there should be no suppression of evidence seized after an otherwise reasonable search--</text>

            <text syncTime="205.829" offset="929771">So, you have an apartment building where the police know from experience there is a lot of illegal activity, a lot of drugs, drug transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.415" offset="964148">Every 2 weeks they walk through and knock on every door and wait for evidence of the destruction of -- of -- of drugs.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.322" offset="1099776">In this case there was probable cause due to the smell of marijuana.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.937" offset="1194235">They don't just knock on every door, but they knock on the doors where they smell marijuana, and they do that just as a routine, in all the buildings where they suspect there may be drug -- drugs being stashed.</text>
