            <text syncTime="8.229" offset="137362">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.149" offset="148961">The question in this case is whether the dramatically harsher mandatory minimum penalty for what the statute terms cocaine base applies to all offenses involving cocaine or only those involving substances with the characteristics of crack cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.487" offset="206326">In its brief in the Kimbrough case, the government described the provision at issue here as reflecting Congress's determination that, and I'm quoting,</text>
            <text syncTime="33.735" offset="239344">"crimes involving crack should be subject to considerably more severe penalties. "</text>
            <text syncTime="37.794" offset="255540">We agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.828" offset="259720">Congress's targeting of a limited subset of the substances qualifying chemically as -- as cocaine is manifest in the statutory structure, in the language, for three basic reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.401" offset="306009">And I'm going to be looking at page 2 of our blue brief, which has the relevant statutory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.506" offset="326384">First, the only way to give different meaning to two distinct terms that Congress used in the statute -- "cocaine" on the one hand and "cocaine base" on the other -- is to make clear that cocaine base means something different than all substances with the chemical formula [C17H21NO4.]</text>

            <text syncTime="86.573" offset="450727">How is that a sensible interpretation of the statute, one that would exclude freebase, a commonly known substance?</text>
            <text syncTime="94.287" offset="481552">Congress was aware of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.586" offset="486776">The Richard Pryor incident had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.648" offset="495031">Everybody knew it was dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.738" offset="503390">Wasn't it at least true that Congress meant to incorporate that substance as well?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_j_pincus" startTime="105.470" stopTime="221.344">
            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Pincus</label>
            <text syncTime="105.470" offset="526273">Let me answer -- answer your question with a little bit of detail, Justice Kagan, because I think our reply brief wasn't as clear as it might have been, because the word "freebase" has, really, three different meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.997" offset="572353">It means a manufacturing process; it means a method of use of a cocaine-related substance; and it also means a substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.511" offset="602446">So just to be clear: Freebase, the manufacturing process, occurs when cocaine hydrochloride, the powder form of cocaine, is mixed with ether and ammonia in a very volatile mixture and boiled.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.283" offset="669529">Most -- many users of freebase inhale the fumes that are released during that manufacturing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.512" offset="706414">That process is very dangerous, as the Richard Pryor incident showed, because the substance is quite volatile and will explode.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.965" offset="736298">If that process -- if the substance is not used then, but goes to the very end, when all of the liquids are boiled off, then it does produce a rock-like substance similar to crack cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.898" offset="783945">Our submission is that the -- if the substance is permitted to go to the end, and if, in effect, ether and ammonia are used as a substitute for sodium bicarbonate, then the substance does qualify under the statute, because it is a rock-like substance that has -- is chemically cocaine, and was produced in a method similar to the reacting of sodium bicarbonate with baking soda.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.760" offset="903481">But in -- when the process is in the middle of the production process, we don't think Congress meant to reach that for a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.165" offset="933052">First of all, because that was -- is -- that substance is not something that's easily marketable.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.333" offset="953741">And one of the key things that Congress was concerned about was the marketability of crack cocaine in its rock-like form.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.753" offset="983416">That's what made the really big difference.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="221.344" offset="989790">Mr. Pincus, if the -- the substance that is involved in this case was a rock-like substance and it wasn't a powder.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.448" offset="1018211">So why doesn't it belong?</text>
            <text syncTime="231.978" offset="1032317">It's a rock-like substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.335" offset="1037751">Why should it be outside the category cocaine base?</text>

            <text syncTime="239.788" offset="1063560">Well, I think there would be a factual question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.271" offset="1077457">None of the courts below, Justice Ginsburg, determined whether, in fact, this -- the substance at issue in this case was crack cocaine, because the district court ruled that that wasn't necessary, that all chemical -- as long as the substance chemically qualified as cocaine, it satisfied the statutory requirement, and the First Circuit agreed.</text>

            <text syncTime="531.152" offset="2229039">Second of all, the statute shows just by the 100-to-1 ratio that Congress was focused on something that was especially dangerous, much more dangerous than powder.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.395" offset="2282015">Third, the legislative context was, as the Court said in Kimbrough, that this was a statute that was enacted in response to a particular problem, and I think the question we're debating is: Would Congress have said, when it defined the term -- when it defined the term "cocaine base" -- and I should say, "base" was one of the street terms, colloquial terms, that was used at the time to -- to describe these categories of substances.</text>

            <text syncTime="684.399" offset="2841976">The provision just above large Roman numeral IV talks about compounds and mixtures, and Congress is sensitive in crafting the drug laws that often, because these substances are not prepared in a chemistry lab, there are many, many impurities associated with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.659" offset="2899028">For example, even cocaine hydrochloride, cocaine powder, is not pure cocaine hydrochloride.</text>

            <text syncTime="707.765" offset="2935495">And so in all -- throughout the drug laws Congress has used that and we think that's exactly why it used a similar phrase here, because the crack rock does not contain 100 percent chemical cocaine in a rock-like form.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.868" offset="2991919">There will be cocaine powder often, cocaine hydrochloride left.</text>

            <text syncTime="1669.006" offset="6780406">There was evidence before Congress about different base forms of cocaine, that distinguished between the salt form and the base form, and it mentioned substances like coca paste, it mentioned substances like freebase, and it mentioned crack.</text>

            <text syncTime="1719.707" offset="6983220">In the preceding provision in Romanette (ii), Congress was defining the whole world of cocaine-related substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.984" offset="7008298">So when it used "cocaine" there -- and it does mean cocaine base there -- but cocaine, its salt, its optical and geometric isomers, it's talking about everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.791" offset="7039540">It didn't need to distinguish between the different forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.885" offset="7047899">And that formulation had already existed like that in the Controlled Substances Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.194" offset="7065140">But then in 1986 Congress was hearing testimony about a specific form, the base form of cocaine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.162" offset="7212993">Another way to think about it is this: In 1986, prior to 1986, this Court had decided cases in which it had said, somewhat imprecisely, that cocaine hydrochloride was cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.439" offset="7258133">It called it "cocaine" throughout its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.862" offset="7263880">It didn't make a scientific finding, but that's how the Court referred to cocaine hydrochloride, "cocaine".</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.392" offset="7277986">This was in its 1970 decision in Turner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.110" offset="7288853">It was in its 1985 decision in Montoya de Hernandez.</text>

            <text syncTime="2667.659" offset="10775050">The one thing that can't be changed is the chemical composition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.393" offset="10785917">It's still in the base form; it's still deadly; it still can be smoked.</text>

            <text syncTime="2685.496" offset="10846417">It can be ground up to a powder and it can be smoked that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.027" offset="10856552">But the important think is that it's the same thing chemically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.414" offset="10866061">And I think if you look at the Controlled Substances Act, not just in this provision, but holistically, what Congress was concerned about was dangerous chemicals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.756" offset="10895423">This gets back to the point that the Chief Justice made, which is the reference in the provision at issue here to a "mixture or substance" containing cocaine base.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.816" offset="10927710">The thing that Congress looked at was: Do you have a substance which may not be 100 percent pure; it's sold on the street; but does it contain the dangerous chemical?</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.389" offset="10957908">Congress defines throughout the Controlled Substances Act the things that it was concerned about in chemical terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.888" offset="10979955">And that's just not because it was an easy way to define things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.902" offset="10991971">It does give greater accuracy and certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.293" offset="11001584">But it's because the harms that are visited on people, the reason that they are controlled substances, that they don't have approved medical uses, and that they are extremely addictive, is because the chemical is inside of them and the chemical is dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.662" offset="11051008">So whether you get the chemical out of paste, whether you get it out of rocks, whether you grind the rocks and make it into a powder, whether you freebase it, it is the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.425" offset="11082146">And just to -- to make sure the Court has you know, some example or some thoughts as to the issues that would be caused if the Court started making up definitions of crack, you know, a word that doesn't appear in the statute and does not have any clear meaning -- you know, Petitioner says it wasn't clear in 1986, the definition of crack -- I just want to give the Court an example of some of the problems that the -- the issues the courts of appeals have confronted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.916" offset="11168037">In several courts of appeals there have been substances which I think perhaps under Justice Breyer's definition would qualify as paste.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.616" offset="11194890">The courts didn't call them paste, but in the Bryant case in the Fifth Circuit they said there was a brown, soft, mushy wet substance that contained cocaine base was being brought in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.582" offset="11234701">The Easter case in the Tenth Circuit: a wet gooey, cream-colored substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.812" offset="11251628">Those courts are ones that use the chemical definition of cocaine base, and they said, look, they contain cocaine base, they have the deadly chemicals, they count.</text>

            <text syncTime="2891.020" offset="11668438">I think if it's just a -- a regular DEA chemist, they would be able to tell you what chemicals they can find through standard techniques like infrared spectroscopy, like gas chromatography, and they can say we've identified these chemicals in this substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.793" offset="11719534">Unless it is a chemist -- and we do have some that have additional knowledge of methods of preparation, DEA agents who have that kind of experience, have seen it prepared -- those chemists -- regular chemists would not be testifying about how it was prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.350" offset="11769793">For example in this case the chemist testified that the -- the sample had cocaine base, it did not have detectable amounts of sodium bicarbonate, and then defense counsel said well is -- is this -- do you think that it's -- or I'm sorry, the chemist, the defense counsel said -- wanted to -- tried to distinguish it from freebase, and said it's freebase crack; and the chemist said you know, I can't answer those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.483" offset="11854326">I can tell you scientifically what it includes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.498" offset="11862371">And that -- that's really the -- the issue of proof, is that you can tell chemically that it has the substance that Congress was trying to get at, the cocaine base.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.133" offset="11892882">I suppose you can tell what other impurities are there, but you know, Congress doesn't care about the impurities, it cares about the cocaine base; and that's why you know, it says mixture of substance containing cocaine base.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.566" offset="11930708">You know, one -- one other thing that I just want to make sure is clear to the Court, is that there was ample testimony before Congress at the time that it enacted this provision about the chemistry of this all, that when Congress spoke about cocaine base, it was understanding that base meant chemically the base form, and that again is near the pages I cited to Justice Breyer in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.232" offset="12009284">But two different scientists, one was the head of the National Institute for Drug Abuse; the other was the -- was a professor at Yale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.619" offset="12034884">Both with experience, and they said things like the form of the drug is the freebase, the usual kind of cocaine is a salt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.709" offset="12059230">It is cocaine with hydrochloride, it is a salt like sodium chloride.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.129" offset="12072918">But this has no chloride attached to it, it is freebase, which is just plain cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.145" offset="12089010">So Congress knew the base form of cocaine is what would normally be called cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.798" offset="12107609">It learned about the science and it used the term cocaine base.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.793" offset="12119521">And I take your point, Justice Kagan, some of the other Justices: There is perhaps redundancy in saying cocaine base instead of just saying cocaine, but when Congress in 1986 was faced with a situation where courts, including this Court, had used the term cocaine to refer imprecisely to the cocaine hydrochloride form and Congress was going to put a mandatory minimum penalty in place, Congress had every incentive to be extra clear, and that's exactly what we think that Congress was doing here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3050.853" offset="12307811">I don't know that we've seen any cases like that, but it is almost always cut with something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.727" offset="12327351">So just to wrap up and be as clear as possible, what Congress had intended to do in the Controlled Substances Act really was to pull out chemicals that -- that have certain pharmacological effects on people that are dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.752" offset="12403419">Congress did that by using the term "cocaine base".</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.718" offset="12411256">That is a term that is expansive and includes all these kind of forms that we've been talking about today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.420" offset="12430064">The lower courts have struggled in trying to figure out whether a substance that's wet, off-white, rock-like, paste-like counts as cocaine base.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.778" offset="12463501">Certainly the Seventh Circuit has had several cases like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.977" offset="12472278">It struggled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.336" offset="12473741">If this Court picks just one definition to limit the term "cocaine base", it's really setting up a road to evasion for drug traffickers to change to a different form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.570" offset="12510626">We hope that this Court won't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.379" offset="12517940">We just don't think the text supports it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.877" offset="12523896">It says "cocaine base" without any limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.096" offset="12532778">And this -- we just don't think that this -- this Court should be adding a limitation based on what it thinks Congress must have intended but didn't say in the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.622" offset="12562871">If the Court has no further questions, the judgment below should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3143.346" offset="12677810">"because they do not present the heightened concerns associated with crack cocaine. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3168.679" offset="12779060">But I think the question here -- all of these substances are criminalized, and they're all going to be penalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.081" offset="12800690">The question is: What deserves the 100-to-1 sanction?</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.255" offset="12813437">That, to us, means something that Congress was especially concerned about, and certainly, because the government agrees that cocaine hydrochloride is only in 2, something that's worse than cocaine hydrochloride, which is a pretty bad thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.360" offset="12861816">As Judge Posner said, there's no reason to imagine that Congress meant to punish paste more than cocaine hydrochloride.</text>

            <text syncTime="3197.934" offset="12896089">It's because it contains base, and for many years, it was smoked in Latin America and can be smoked here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Pincus</label>
            <text syncTime="3207.382" offset="12933914">Our response is that it is -- it does not have the potency that crack had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.130" offset="12948961">It was smoked here and didn't give rise to the epidemic that occurred once crack was created, because that was more potent, more marketable, and led to all the evils that Congress was trying to get at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.690" offset="12991175">Second point: We would be very happy to accept your definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.530" offset="13010505">Third point, about the statutory language: I think the critical question here, as several members of the Court have noted, is that (ii), but throughout the statute -- means all chemical forms of cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.383" offset="13077901">If that's what Congress meant in (iii), there was no reason to just -- not to just say it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.099" offset="13100784">The words "cocaine base" could have a chemical meaning, but the word "base" was also in this debate as a word that was being used to describe the specific evil that Congress was aimed at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.593" offset="13154806">And so we think, at the worst, there's ambiguity here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.954" offset="13168180">We think it's quite clear that by using those different terms, Congress meant something different, but at worst, there's ambiguity here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.029" offset="13192526">And an ambiguity, under the rule of lenity, means that the clause should be construed narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.715" offset="13215305">And, Justice Scalia, going to your point in your analogy to State law, the problem here is that everything that is in clause 2 is in clause 3 under the government's interpretation, because clause 2, Roman (II), has the word 2, Roman (IV), says any compound mixture or whatever containing cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.814" offset="13291687">Under the government's theory, that provision will never, ever be invoked, because every offense that uses cocaine is sanctionable under 3.</text>

            <text syncTime="3311.964" offset="13352291">--Yes, but the question here is whether every homicide -- whether every lesser form of homicide is also capital murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.821" offset="13383638">And what the government's position means: Every lesser form of homicide, everything that's in (II) that sets up a punishment, is also in (III), and we think that's the problem with their interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.800" offset="13423553">And it's why, if it's unclear, as you said maybe it was, then the rule of lenity should apply, and Congress can fix it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.344" offset="13457721">If Congress meant to include all of these other substances, Congress can easily fix the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.172" offset="13477052">But we think, given the way the statute looks right now, that's not possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="3368.862" offset="13579870">Is your argument that it's redundant based on the fact that a larger grouping of the chemicals listed in Roman numeral number (II) is excluded by Roman numeral number (III), so that -- is that the basis of your argument?</text>
