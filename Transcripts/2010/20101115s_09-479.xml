            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">A federal criminal statute, Section 924(c) of Title 18, makes it a discrete offense to use, carry or possess a deadly weapon in connection with any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.620" offset="178845">The statute imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of five years to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment imposed on the offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.248" offset="225343">In 1998, Congress reformulated 924(c) in the name, to enlarge its scope and heighten penalties for violation of the provi -- provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.050" offset="280618">Spotting the question we decide today, Congress also added a preparatory except clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.007" offset="312383">The clause states that the five-year minimum sentence shall be imposed except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by 924(c) itself or by any other provision of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.762" offset="387406">In unrelated cases, petitioners Kevin Abbott and Carlos Rashad Gould, each received a five-year sentence for violating 924(c) by possessing a firearm in connection with the drug trafficking crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.099" offset="448742">Abbott's five-year sentence was imposed on top of a 15 year mandatory sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.804" offset="483641">Gould's five-year term was added to a ten-year mandatory sentence for his drug trafficking crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.746" offset="511331">Abbott and Gould contend that there are heavier sentences imposed for counts of conviction other than 924(c), each of them greater than five years, triggered the “except” clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.719" offset="563263">The clause as they read it, exempts them from serving the additional five-year term specified for violating 924(c) by possessing a firearm in connection with the drug trafficking crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.505" offset="614463">The courts below, at the second -- the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Third and Fifth Circuits, rejected Abbott's and Gould's interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.038" offset="652497">The “except” clause, those courts noted, refers to a greater minimum sentence otherwise provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.909" offset="684053">“Otherwise provided for what?”</text>
            <text syncTime="147.624" offset="694920">the courts asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.075" offset="700667">They answered, “A conduct violating 924(c) that is, possessing a firearm in connection with a violent or drug trafficking crime.”</text>
            <text syncTime="159.343" offset="741731">We affirm the judgments of the Circuit Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.690" offset="755106">The “except” clause we hold, applies only when another provision whether contained within or placed outside 924(c) imposes a higher mandatory minimum penalty for conduct violating 924(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="178.617" offset="818845">As an illustration, the mandatory minimum sentence for a 924(c) offense is five years but if the firearm is brandished, the minimum rises to seven and if the firearm is discharged, to ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.713" offset="875269">A defendant who possess, brandished and discharged a firearm in violation of 924(c), would thus face a mandatory of minimum term of ten years, the penalty for firing a weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.929" offset="932112">But there is no stacking five years and seven on that added to 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.479" offset="950293">And dispositive here, the defendant is not spared from serving a discrete 924(c) sentence by virtue of receiving a higher mandatory minimum on a different count of conviction in Abbott's case, being a felon in possession of a firearm and in Gould's, drug trafficking.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.215" offset="1033258">Rather a 924(c) violator is subject to the highest mandatory minimum specified for the conduct offending 924(c) unless another provision of law addressed to the conduct prescribed by 924(c), imposes an even greater mandatory minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.249" offset="1113401">Our decision is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.024" offset="1124477">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</text>
