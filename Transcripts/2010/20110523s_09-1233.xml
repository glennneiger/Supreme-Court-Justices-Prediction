            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">This case arises from serious constitutional violations in California's prison system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.677">The violations have persisted for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.055">They remain uncorrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.257">Now, this is a direct appeal to this Court from a three-judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.205">And the District Court's order directs California to remedy two ongoing violations of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.811">And those violations are the subject of two federal class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.146">The first case is Coleman versus Brown, and that involves prisoners with serious mental disorders.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.380">Plata versus Brown involves prisoners with serious medical conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.555">And the order of the three-judge court that we're reviewing here applies to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.697">The appeal turns largely on whether the order complies with the statutory provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, a congressional act, enacted in 1995.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.657">The specific provision to be consulted for the case, which contains many of the phrases that the Court examines, is 18 U.S.C. 3626.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.987">And that section contains limitations on the issuance of orders that require release of prisoners to remedy constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.680">One of these requirements is that the order be issued by a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.480">The Court today issues a lengthy opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.005">It determines that the order of the three-judge court does meet all the statutory requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.565">The order leaves the choice of means to reduce overcrowding to the discretion of state officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.853">But absent compliance through new construction, out-of-state transfers, or other means, the State will be required to release prisoners before their full sentences have been served.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.136">The required reduction could be as high as 46,000 prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.287">The State has already reduced the population by 9000 persons during this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.108">Further reductions need not be accomplished in an indiscriminate manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.167">The State may employ measures that will mitigate the impact, including good-time credits and diversion of low-risk offenders to community-based programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.932">The population reduction potentially required is nevertheless of unprecedented sweep and extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.247">A mistake and a premature release of even one prisoner can cause injury and harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.436">And the release of prisoners in large numbers is a matter of undoubted, grave -- grave concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.149">Yet so too is the continuing injury and harm resulting from these serious constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.346">For years, the medical and mental health care provided by California's prisons has fallen short of minimum constitutional requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.017">In 2006, the suicide rate in California's prison was nearly 80% higher than the national average for prison populations.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.411">Wait times for mental health care range as high as 12 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.513">Prisoners suffering from physical illness also receive severely deficient care.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.912">And the record documents numerous instances of delay and neglect leading to suffering and -- and even death.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.227">As a consequence of their own actions, prisoners maybe deprived the fundamental rights of liberty yet the law and the Constitution demand recognition of certain other rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.960">Prisoners retain the essence of human dignity inherent in all persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.217">Respect for that dignity animates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.984">If Government fails to provide for the prisoners' basic needs, the courts have the responsibility to remedy a resulting Eighth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.679">Years of efforts to remedy the violations in this case have been frustrated by severe overcrowding.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.343">California's prisons are designed to house a population just under 80,000, and at the time of the three-judge court's decision, the population was almost double that.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.796">Prisoners are crammed into spaces neither designed nor intended to house inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.796">As many as 200 may live in a gymnasium, monitored by as few as two or three correctional officers, as many as 54 prisoners may share a single toilet.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.165">Short term gains in the provision of care have been eroded by the long-term effects of severe and pervasive overcrowding.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.607">When the three-judge court was convened, 12 years had passed since the appointment of the Special Master in the Coleman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.152">Five years had passed since the approval of a consent decree, it was a consent decree approved by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.967">Five years had passed since the approval of that decree in the Plata case.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.040">The State does not claim that either measure achieved a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.084">Both the Coleman and Plata District Courts had recently undertaken additional remedial efforts, including the appointment of a Receiver in the Plata case.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.325">The basic plan to solve the crisis through construction, hiring and procedural reforms nevertheless remained unchanged.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.941">The Special Master and the --- and the Receiver were unable to provide assurance that such efforts would yield success absent a population reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.391">The Special Master explained that many of the clinical advances painfully accomplished over the past decade are slip-sliding away as a result of overcrowding.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.843">And the Receiver indicated that, absent a reduction in overcrowding, a successful remedial effort could all but bankrupt California.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.238">Having engaged in remedial efforts for five years in Plata and 12 years in Coleman, the District Courts were not required to wait to see whether more recent efforts would yield equal disappointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.791">The Coleman and Plata Courts had a solid basis to doubt that additional efforts to build facilities and hire staff would achieve a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.032">Indeed, although four years have passed since the three-judge court was convened, there is still no indication that the constitutional violations have been cured.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.844">Once the three-judge court was convened, it was required to find that overcrowding is the primary cause of the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.833">The record documents the severe impact of burgeoning demand on the provision of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.023">Crowding creates unsafe and unsanitary conditions that hamper effective delivery of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.789">A medical expert described living quarters in converted gymnasiums or dayrooms as breeding grounds for disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.366">Cramped conditions promote unrest and violence, making it difficult for prison officials to monitor and control the prison population.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.952">On any given day, prisoners in the general prison population may become ill, thus entering the plaintiff class.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.148">And overcrowding may prevent immediate medical attention necessary to avoid suffering, death and spread of disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.396">These effects are particularly acute in the prisons' reception centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.876">These intake areas process 140,000 new or returning persons every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.591">Crowding in these areas runs as high as 300% of design capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.604">Some inmates are held in a reception centers for their entire period of incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.202">Numerous experts testified that crowding is the primary cause of the constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.711">And these experts had long experience in correctional systems both in California and in other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.607">The former warden of San Quentin and the former acting secretary of the California prison system concluded that crowding makes it virtually impossible for the organization to develop much less implement a plan to provide prisoners with adequate quick care.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.306">The State points to no significant contrary evidence that it was unable to present and that it would've changed the outcome here.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.207">Now, construction of new facilities -- excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.658">Construction of new facilities, in theory, could alleviate overcrowding, but the three-judge court found no realistic possibility that California would be able to build itself out of this crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.256">Particularly in light of California's fiscal condition, the -- the three-judge court deemed chimerical any remedy that would require significant additional spending by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.989">The State claims that a combination of construction, transfers of prisoners to other States and other reforms could remedy the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.823">This is a long opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.006">Aside from asserting this proposition, the State offers no reason to believe that that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.166">There's noted attempts to remedy the violations in Plata have been ongoing for nine years.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.686">And in Coleman, remedial expert -- remedial efforts have been going on for 16 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.247">At one time, it may have been possible to hope that these violations would be cured without a reduction in overcrowding.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.266">A long history of failed remedial orders compels a different conclusion today.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.336">The three-judge court credited substantial evidence that prison populations can be reduced in a manner that does not increase crime to a significant degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.706">Some evidence indicated that reduced overcrowding can even improve public safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.535">The current head of Pennsylvania's correctional system testified that measures to reduce the prison population may actually improve on public safety because they address the problems that brought people to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.616">Expert witnesses produced statistical evidence that prison populations had been lowered without adversely affecting public safety in a number of jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.053">During the pendency of this appeal, the State in fact began to implement measures to reduce the prison population.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.598">These measures will shift thousands of prisoners from the state prisons to county jails by making certain felonies punishable by imprisonment in county jail and requiring that individuals return to custody for violating their conditions of parole serve any custody term in the county jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.581">This supports the three-judge court's conclusions that the prison population can be reduced in a manner calculated to avoid an undue negative effect on public safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.148">This Court therefore affirms the order of the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.650">Yet, it notes that the three-judge court retains the authority, and that the responsibility to make further amendments to the existing order as warranted by the exercise of its sound discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.861">Proper respect for the State requires that the three-judge court exercise its jurisdiction to accord the State considerable latitude to find mechanisms and make plans to correct the violations in a prompt and -- and effective way consistent with public safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.123">The State, for instance, may wish to move to extend the deadline for the required reduction to five years from the entry of the judgment of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.393">The State previously proposed the five-year deadline as consistent with the public safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.477">The three-judge court may grant such a request provided that the State satisfies necessary and appropriate preconditions designed to ensure that a remedy is implemented without undue delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.881">The three-judge court may also condition an extension of time on the State's ability to meet interim benchmarks for improvement in provision of medical and mental health care.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.485">If significant progress is made toward remedying the underlying constitutional violations, that progress may demonstrate that further population reductions are not necessarily or are less urgent than previously believed.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.800">Were the State to make this showing, the three-judge court could consider whether it is appropriate to extend or modify the timeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.741">These observations reflect the fact that the three-judge court's order, like all continuing equitable decrees, must remain open to appropriate modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.240">They are not intended to cast doubt on the validity of the basic premise of the existing order.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.757">The medical and mental health care provided by California's prisons falls below the standard of decency that inheres in the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.022">This extensive and ongoing constitutional violation requires a remedy, and a remedy will not be achieved without a reduction in overcrowding.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.821">The relief ordered by the three-judge court is required by the Constitution and was authorized by Congress in the Prison Litigation Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.650">The State shall implement the order without further delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.586">The judgment of the three-judge court is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.594">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Thomas joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.187">Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice joins.</text>
