            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">I will summarize my dissent which as you've heard is joined by Justice Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.451">Today, the Court affirms what is perhaps the most radical injunction issued by a court in our nation's history, an order requiring California to release the staggering number of 46,000 convicted felons.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.873">The Court disregards stringently drawn provisions of the governing statute and traditional constitutional limitations upon the power of a federal judge in order to uphold -- uphold the absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.379">I dissent because the institutional reform the District Court has undertaken violates the terms of the governing statute ignores bedrock limitations on the power of Article III judges and takes federal courts wildly beyond their institutional capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.080">First, the plaintiff classes here should never have been certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.155">The classes as you have heard consist of all prisoners who are seriously mentally ill or who have serious mental -- medical conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.970">These classes do not base their claims on individual instances of mistreatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.780">It is not claimed that all or even most of them have been denied needed care.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.245">They instead based their claims on system wide deficiencies in medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.839">But the sole purpose of class wide adjudication is to aggregate claims that are individually valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.961">And it is impossible to say that each and every prisoner who happens to be physically or mentally ill in a prison that has systemic weaknesses has thus suffered cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.311">The only viable claims are those by prisoners who have themselves been denied needed medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.437">Since the class is certified here are improper, it follows that the remedy decreed is also illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.764">The remedy of reforming the system as a whole is not narrowly drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.448">That's a quote from the statute as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.199">Even accepting the premise that class certification was proper, we have no business affirming the District Court's structural injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.480">This case illustrates one of the most pernicious aspects of structural injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.531">They force judges to engage in a form of fact-finding as policy making that is outside the traditional judicial role.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.507">The fact-finding that judges traditionally engage in involves the determination of past or present facts based exclusively upon a closed trial record.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.805">In contrast, when a judge manages a structural injunction he will inevitably be required to make broad empirical predictions necessarily based in large part upon policy views.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.517">The sort of predictions regularly made by legislators and executive officials but inappropriate for the third branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.358">This feature of structural injunctions is superbly illustrated by the District Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.216">The District Court found as a fact among other things that the evidence was "clear" that prison over crowding would "perpetuate a criminogenic prison system that itself threatens public safety" and that "additional rehabilitated programming would result in a significant population reduction while improving public safety".</text>
            <text syncTime="243.203">The idea that the three district judges in this case relied solely on the credibility of the testifying expert witnesses enriching these conclusions is fanciful.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.193">Of course they were relying largely on their own beliefs about penology and recidivism.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.757">What it could here is no more judicial fact-finding in the ordinary sense then would be the factual findings that deficit spending will not lower the unemployment rate or that the continued occupation of Iraq will decrease the risk of terrorism.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.375">Yet, because they have been granted "factual findings" entitled to differential review, the policy preferences of three district judges now govern the operation of California's penal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.366">But structural injunctions do not simply invite judges to indulge policy preferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.030">They invite judges to indulge incompetent policy preferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.253">Three years of law school and familiarity with pertinent Supreme Court precedents give no insight whatsoever into the management of social institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.919">The District Court's finding that constitutionally adequate medical services could be provided if the prison population was 137.5% of design capacity was a finding the District Court was utterly unqualified to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.336">My general concern is about judges running social institutions are magnified in connection with prison release orders recognizing that habeas corpus relief must be granted sparingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.275">This Court has reversed the Ninth Circuit's erroneous grant of habeas relief to individual California prisoners four times this term alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.915">Well here, the Court affirms an order granting the functional equivalent of 46,000 writs of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.976">It seems that the Court's respect for state sovereignty has vanished in the case where it most matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.128">The Court attempts to defend its opinion by means of a bizarre coda noting that "the state may wish to move for modification of the three-judge courts order to extend the deadline for the required reduction to five years".</text>
            <text syncTime="392.630">And that the District Court "may grant such a request provided that the state satisfies necessary and appropriate preconditions designed to ensure the measures are taken to implement the plan without undue delay".</text>
            <text syncTime="407.969">What a strange thing to do to approve the injunction in its present form.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.450">But intimate that the District Court had better approve certain changes if the state asks for them as it is invited to ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.422">The Court must be aware that the judges of the District Court are likely to call its bluff since they know full well they cannot possibly be an abusive discretion to refuse to accept the state's proposed modifications of an injunction that has just been approved by this Court in its present form.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.818">So perhaps the coda is really nothing more than a ceremonial washing of the hands making it clear for all to see that if the terrible thing sure to happen as a consequence of this outrageous order do happen, they will be none of this Court's responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.141">After all, did we not want and indeed even suggest something better?</text>
            <text syncTime="464.354">In my view, the Prison Litigation Reform Act prohibits a court from ordering a prisoner's release unless it determines that the prisoner, the prisoner is suffering from a violation of his constitutional rights and that his release and no other relief will remedy that violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.939">Thus, if the Court determines that a particular prisoner is being denied constitutionally required medical treatment and the release of that prisoner and no other remedy would enable him to obtain medical treatment, then the Court can order his release.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.078">But a Court may not order the release of prisoners who have suffered no violation of their constitutional rights merely to make it less likely that such violations will happen to other prisoners in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.753">Bear in mind that the 46,000 prisoners ordered to be released are not those who have been denied needed medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.789">They are not even those who suffer mental or physical illnesses that supposedly place them in danger of being denied needed medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.438">They are just 46,000 happy-go-lucky felons fortunate enough to be selected for release in order to make more space that the District Court has "found is needed to solve the systemic deficiency."</text>
            <text syncTime="547.540">The injunction in this case was in my view clearly contrary to law.</text>
