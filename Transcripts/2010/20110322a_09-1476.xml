            <text syncTime="13.260">In asking this Court to cabin Connick v. Myers' public concern requirement, Respondent would constitutionalize, under the Petition Clause, large parts of the law of public employee discipline, and thereby grant to public employees a broad constitutional employment right that private employees do not enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.907">Two independent reasons, however, argue strongly for applying the public concern requirement to discipline claims brought both under the Free Speech and the Petition Clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.834">First, the constitutional framework principles this Court has repeatedly identified in its public employment cases argue strongly for requiring it.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.592">And second, McDonald v. Smith's principle of parity argues strongly for creating no hierarchy between the Free Speech and Petition Clauses.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel R. Ortiz</label>
            <text syncTime="140.767">--Your Honor, this -- under the constitutional background principles this Court has developed, this Court should look at -- looks at how close to the core a particular example of employee activity is, and then talks about how much of a burden that kind of activity poses to the efficient operation of the workplace.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="163.880">But the core -- the core of the Petition Clause is petitioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.936">The core of the Free Speech Clause is political speech, of course -- speech in public interest -- but the core of the Petition Clause is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.123">It's simply whether you're petitioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.362">Surely you -- you could petition the -- most of the petitions in the early years were regarding private matters; isn't that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_r_ortiz" startTime="192.654" stopTime="231.778">
            <label>Mr. Daniel R. Ortiz</label>
            <text syncTime="192.654">That is right, Your Honor, just as most examples of speech concern private matters, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.464">Yet that does not define the core of the Free Speech Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.798">There's not an empirical inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.897">That depends upon the purpose of the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.248">And as this Court stated very definitely in McDonald, the core of the Petition Clause, like the Free Speech Clause, was -- was aimed at promoting democratic self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.759">Petitioning is a particular form of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.011">It is speech directed to a particular audience, the government, some arm of government, some individual in government, and it is speech that has a particular purpose: Asking for a change of some sort in government policy.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="231.778">That's true, and it seems to me the -- the core is involved whenever you're asking for a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.967">And it seems to me that the key distinction, if there is one, is whether you're asking for a change in -- by your employer in your employment conditions or a change by the government in some matters over which the government has control as -- as sovereign.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Daniel R. Ortiz</label>
            <text syncTime="259.245">Well, Your Honor, in practice, that inquiry would not align much differently than the Connick inquiry.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="267.277" stopTime="269.766">

            <label>Mr. Daniel R. Ortiz</label>
            <text syncTime="269.766">And in this particular case, designing a kind of threshold inquiry along those lines would actually advantage Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.188">One difficulty in application, though, is that this Court has always identified the purpose of the Connick threshold test as categoricalizing in a way the Pickering balancing inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.385">And if you had a threshold test that basically did not match, was a little oblique to the Pickering balancing inquiry, it would create much more work for the lower courts along the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.026">Or perhaps this Court would want to change the Pickering balancing inquiry.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="313.063">If the Pickering balancing inquiry still aligns with the traditional framework that this Court has described in its employment cases, what I describe, and this other inquiry, which you're suggesting, Justice Scalia, was somewhat oblique to it, then it might conceivably be necessary to do both.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.208">If you're proceeding with a claim under two separate provisions of the Constitution, it should not be surprising that you might have two different tests.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel R. Ortiz</label>
            <text syncTime="341.108">--Well, Your Honor, then that might argue for more reengineering of the rest of the -- the enterprise as well, a step that this Court has not identified as appropriate under--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="353.541">Why would it make -- why would it make a difference at what you call the balancing stage whether it is -- whether the distinction is between public speech and private speech on the one hand or government as employer and government as sovereign on the other?</text>
            <text syncTime="374.462">Why would there be any difference?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Daniel R. Ortiz</label>
            <text syncTime="377.298">--Well, Your Honor, if at the first stage the Court is running an inquiry that is something different from Connick, that is not going to map onto traditional Pickering balancing, at least as this Court has described it, at the second stage.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="392.283" stopTime="392.704">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>

            <label>Mr. Daniel R. Ortiz</label>
            <text syncTime="392.704">Because, Your Honor, Pickering balancing has gone to things like how -- how -- how important that particular example of speech is, how close it is to the core of what the First Amendment protects, and then that is weighed against the kind of burden it would place on the government to have that activity protected in a very strong way.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="420.623">I think all you're saying is that one of the elements of Pickering balancing is the element of Petition Clause jurisprudence, as I suggested it -- it might be applied; that is, in Pickering balancing, certainly you have to ask, was what the individual was asking for a change in employment conditions?</text>
            <text syncTime="446.300">That would be one of the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.185">If so, it was a private matter, and then you go on to the rest of the balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.313">But it seems to me you have to make that determination under Pickering balancing anyway, and once you make it, you've answered the -- the Petition Clause question.</text>

            <text syncTime="462.005">Well, Your Honor, if this -- if this Court were to proceed down that road, Petitioners, I believe, would still end up victorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.975">This is a case, as I understand your -- your approach, where the petition does concern purely employment matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.814">It is not a petition aimed at or directed at the government in its capacity as sovereign, so under that kind of analysis, that is where the initial trigger, this case, would have not been constitutionalized.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="497.923">What kind of case, hypothetically, would qualify under your theory as a petitioning case to the sovereign?</text>

            <text syncTime="521.906">If it were a statement that there was a policy, involved a petition against a policy in a government department involving race, that would certainly qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.993">That would be like the Gibbons case under the Free Speech Clause, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="982.106">In -- but certainly something that is privately-related, a public employee is complaining about tax assessment or something like that and tries to sue for retaliation under, under that theory, not for anything related to his or her job, this Court -- under this Court's and the lower court's application of the Connick principles, there would be no problem there treating it as speech or as a petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.536">So it is only when the lawsuit or the petition involves something related to the person's employment that these particular -- this particular test would kick in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.276">And that's consistent, Your Honor, with this Court's twin background constitutional framework principles, one that you look at how much disruption something is likely to pose to the workforce and how central it is to the particular constitutional provision involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.892">In this case, if in general it's not employment-related the government has much less interest in worrying over it this way and applying the Connick threshold test is much less justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.751">You would have to do Pickering balancing, proceed directly to Pickering balancing in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.917">Now, Your Honor, Respondent's view presents several problems of sort of practical application, or would, to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.293">First, it would allow for the easy circumvention of Connick, which is a test that on the free speech side this Court has long held is very important for the public employment field to work efficiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.514">It would be very easy for a particular employee to take activity that Connick would not allow to proceed, to turn into a lawsuit on the free speech clause, and just by rephrasing it, respinning it, whatever, to turn it into a petition where under Respondent's rule the result would be very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.455">It also would require the Court to create a hierarchy between speech claims and petition claims, and, more importantly, if the Court were to go down the particular road that Respondent describes and see the center of the Petition Clause as defined by the access to courts doctrine it would create a hierarchy among different forms of petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.450">All of a sudden, petitions that at the founding were thought to be at the periphery, if there, of the Petition Clause would define its center, and a paradigmatic petition of a letter to Congress asking it to change its position on something would not be covered at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.597">If there are no further questions, I would like to retain my remaining time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1289.864">And that reflects a very important balance that this Court has struck between its view of how the Constitution applies to the government as sovereign regulator of the general public and how it applies to the government and its proprietary status as an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.947">And in that latter situation, Connick has been critical in providing a bulwark against allowing run-of-the-mill employment disputes from becoming constitutional cases in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.822">And the second main problem with the Third Circuit's approach, and it's one that Mr. Ortiz highlighted, is that it privileges petition activity over speech activity, contrary to this Court's numerous statements that there is no such hierarchy in the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1379.491">But as this Court said in Connick that the question about -- of whether speech is a matter of public concern is assessed not only by the content, but by the form and the context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.861">So in the case that Your Honor is positing, the content of the -- of the speech, which was that an act of the legislature was illegal, would suggest that it was a matter of public concern, the form, the form of a lawsuit is relevant to the consideration, and the context that it came in part of a larger political debate would likely be relevant, too.</text>

            <text syncTime="1447.966">So many of these hypotheticals and many submissions and petitions to the government as sovereign will, in fact, satisfy the public concern test, and then you'll get into Pickering balancing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.682">But that's the kind of line-drawing that the Third Circuit approach requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.509">This Court has had a very broad conception of what counts as petitioning activity, so in Edwards v. South Carolina the Court said that a march to the grounds of the State capitol in South Carolina to protest segregation was an example of petitioning conduct in its most classic and pristine form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.576">The Third Circuit doesn't -- doesn't count -- wouldn't count that as a petition for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.225">It has kind of a gerrymandered view of what will count as a petition, basically a lawsuit and an employee grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.576">Now, the -- the approach followed by the majority of the circuits and the approach we advocate today doesn't require that kind of line-drawing, because whether, for example, the grievance filed in this case is a petition or not, it's certainly speech, and so we would agree that it's susceptible to analysis under the normal Connick v.

            <text syncTime="1629.088">So I don't think it -- you know, where an employee physically was when he or she filed the petition isn't really relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.490">The question is the connection to the workplace and the connection to the employer-employee relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.076">So as Mr. Ortiz answered before, the NTEU case provides a separate set of protections under the First Amendment, under the speech protection for employees who engage in speech conduct that has no connection to the workplace, and it would limit the ability of a government employer to take action against such an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.350">But the conduct here is the -- the grievances that were filed here were obviously intimately connected to the workplace relationship between Chief Guarnieri and the Borough Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.185">This was not a case like NTEU, where someone wanted to go out and give a speech on something that had no connection to their job or go out and file a lawsuit or some kind of petitioning activity on something that had no connection to the workplace.</text>

            <text syncTime="1723.634">It's not necessary for this Court in this case to decide whether the petitioning and speech activity here was on a matter of public or private concern.</text>
