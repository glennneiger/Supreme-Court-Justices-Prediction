            <text syncTime="12.198" offset="155188">In Monell v. Department of Social Services, this Court held there could be no liability against a local public entity under section 1983 unless the plaintiff proved causation, namely that the injury that was inflicted was inflicted as a result of a custom, policy, or practice of that local public entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.549" offset="228645">The Ninth Circuit, however, in this case has imposed ex post facto declaratory relief on the County of Los Angeles as well as a substantial fee award, while acknowledging that it has not, in fact, determined whether the injury suffered by the plaintiffs and subject to declaratory relief was the result of a policy, custom, or practice fairly attributable to the County of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.821" offset="313699">It did so because the Ninth Circuit has developed a digression from the Court's jurisprudence in Monell; namely, in the Ninth Circuit, claims for prospective relief, both injunctive and declaratory relief, are not subject to the Monell requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.907" offset="366049">We submit that this is flatly inconsistent with Monell and it erodes the important principles of Federalism that are the motivating factors for the Monell causation requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="899.924" offset="3706169">Monell was concerned with interpreting the language of section 1983, the shall subjective:</text>

            <text syncTime="912.839" offset="3757787">And looking at the legislative history, the 42nd Congress in enacting section 1983 was critical to justice in Monell with the rejection of the Sherman Amendment, which he said was concerned mostly with not imposing coercive liability on the municipality for the actions of others.</text>

            <text syncTime="1050.608" offset="4308867">Let me begin, perhaps, by trying to answer Justice Alito's question about what is at stake here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.089" offset="4334780">Monell held that 1983 as a causation requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.399" offset="4352021">And the Court has, in a series of decisions, elucidated what a plaintiff must prove in the context of claims for damages to satisfy that causation requirement, and it's held in particular that the mere fact that a city employee committed a violation under color of State law in the past is not itself a sufficient link to the municipality itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.408" offset="4436031">And the decisions have been devoted to elucidating precisely what else is required in order to show the sufficient link to the municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.434" offset="4476155">The question here arises in what, we submit, is the very different factual context of ongoing constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.245" offset="4507397">And we think that although the jurisprudence that's developed under Monell has been devoted to fleshing out this other context, the Court should take a look at whether that jurisprudence is the appropriate way to determine whether the causation test is satisfied when there is an ongoing violation, because there is an easier way to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1129.639" offset="4624948">Your Honor, we believe it does require causation, but the question is what kind of facts have to be shown to prove causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.244" offset="4655459">And, in particular, once a plaintiff has shown what is required otherwise to show the violation, to show standing prospective relief and obtain prospective relief, we think those elements will necessarily encompass the showing that is required to prove a link to the municipality itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.674" offset="4733095">And what our concern--</text>

            <text syncTime="1536.305" offset="6251645">I guess the way I would look at the case is, if the party who is being injured filed suit against the municipality and against the official and said, I would like a marriage license, that, as the court heard the case and found yes, there is an unconstitutional denial going on there, the fact that the lawsuit existed and there was an ongoing violation that had been by virtue of the lawsuit brought to the attention of the policymaker, and if in that case the judge decided that prospective relief is necessary, which necessarily means that there was some finding of ongoing violation under Lyons and those cases, that there would be a link to the municipality.</text>

            <text syncTime="3150.952" offset="12710264">As far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, California could abolish the County of Los Angeles.</text>

            <text syncTime="3192.134" offset="12874940">If you hold a public entity automatically liable for declaratory injunctive relief for -- for enforcing State law, you really have circumstances where a local entity is going to say we don't need this fight.</text>
