            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 prohibits employers from discharging or discriminating against an employee because that employee has “filed any complaint” related to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.079" offset="185720">Now, the petitioner here Kevin Kasten, complained to his supervisor at work about what he saw as a violation of the Act's provisions governing working hours and later he was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.857" offset="236816">And he says that was in retaliation for having made that complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.468" offset="259281">The question before us here is whether the phrase "filed any complaint" applies to an employee who like petitioner Kasten made a complaint about a violation of the Act but made that complain orally rather than in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.108" offset="333887">The Seventh Circuit held that the phrase "filed any complaint" applies to and protects only those who filed there complaints in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.920" offset="377145">We do not agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.975" offset="385296">The word file does sometimes refer to a writing but sometimes it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.306" offset="410687">And there are two important considerations here that are you in favor of the broader interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.294" offset="434615">First, the Act was passed in the 1930s to protect the poorest of workers limiting its anti-retaliation provision to written complaints would undercut protection for those such as illiterate workers who need it the most.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.778" offset="504519">Second, the Secretary of Labor and the EEOC have long taken the position that the provision protects oral complaints and we were deferred to the reasonable views of those agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.988" offset="561361">This is not to say that a worker can invoke the protections of the Acts simply by going around complaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.943" offset="589155">Rather the statutory text "filed any complaint" does contemplate a degree of formality certainly to the point where the employer, the recipient, has been given fair notice that a grievance about illegal conditions as at issue, it has been lodged and he should reasonably understand that that's meant to be a serious business concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.968" offset="689256">Saint-Gobain makes the additional claim that it should win because the Act protects only complaints made to the Government and not as here simply to a supervisor in a private firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.487" offset="731366">Because this argument was not properly preserved however, we do not consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.067" offset="753727">For these reasons and those given in our opinion filed today, we vacate the judgment of the Seventh Circuit and we remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.741" offset="792388">Justice Scalia has filed the dissenting opinion in which Justice Thomas joins in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.718" offset="816316">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
