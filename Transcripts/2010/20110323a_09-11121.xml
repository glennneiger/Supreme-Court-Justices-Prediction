            <text syncTime="2858.638">I think that's a relatively small and not a particularly problematic category of statements, and I don't think it's worth complicating the Miranda rule in order to make sure that those statements are suppressed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2919.912">And in fact, most of us, many of us, have a great deal more experience understanding the world through the eyes of a young person or children, perhaps, than understanding the eyes -- the world through the eyes of a severely sensory deprived person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.561">We're asking the exact same thing in both contexts: What is this person -- what is this -- what do the objective circumstances appear to a person in this situation?</text>

            <text syncTime="2945.124">--Well, Your Honor, I don't think you're doing the same thing, and I think it's easier to put yourself in the mindset of a person with a sensory deprivation than a person of a particular age, and let me explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.332">For a person with a sensory deprivation, like in Justice Breyer's example, the sign that someone can't read, I think it's very common and easy for officers and courts to figure out how they would react to the situation if the sign simply weren't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.619">With age, what you're asking perhaps a 45-year-old officer to do, in Justice Alito's example, or a 60-year-old judge to do, is to put them into the frame of mind of a person that they haven't been for 32 years or 45 years, and I don't think that's a very easy inquiry to ask officers or courts to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.298">I think this is really going to complicate the Miranda rule by asking them, A, to do that, and, B, because there are going to be many cases, unlike this case, where it's not going to be apparent to the officer what age the suspect is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.735">One thing that comes up fairly commonly in many jurisdictions is that an officer will stop someone on a -- do a traffic stop of someone on the road; the person will claim not to have their ID, and it will turn out the person is 14 and they will give the name and birth date of an older sibling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.388">And there is simply no way for an officer in those circumstances to know what the age of the suspect is.</text>

            <text syncTime="3063.046">Let me deal first with the rule that would only apply when officers know the identity, know the age of the suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.553">I think that rule would be easier to apply than the rule the Petitioners are suggesting and would mitigate some of the damage, but first of all it doesn't solve the critical problem of asking officers who aren't themselves 13 to think like someone who is 13; and second of all, I think for reasons that I think were apparent during the argument by my friend on the other side, that rule might easily devolve into a "should have known" test, and officers simply aren't going to be able to deal with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3421.153">I think what's very odd in this case is that the only party that didn't consider J.D.B.'s age was the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.946">I mean, it was clearly being taken into account by Officer DiCostanzo, and J.D.B. was fully aware of his own age.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.343">And under Thompson v. Keohane, what a reviewing court is supposed to be doing is immersing itself in the actual circumstances of the case; and without this consideration of age, then the courts are examining hypothetical, because -- hypothetical interrogations and not the one that was actually occurring in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.391">Officers have to make judgments about every objective circumstance that arises, and asking them to make objective determinations on juvenile status is no different and is not going to muddy the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.889">I think as Justice Kagan pointed out, custody is a very difficult issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3482.594">But we can't be defining it in such a way where we are requiring these children to be someone that they never could be, and that is, reasonable adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.993">If our goal here is to ensure reliability of factfinding, reliability of statements, if we want to reduce the coercion, to which our citizens are entitled, then this rule needs to be put into play, and we ask that the North Carolina Supreme Court decision be reversed.</text>
