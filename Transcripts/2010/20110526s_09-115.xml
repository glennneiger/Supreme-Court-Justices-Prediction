            <label>Justice John A. Campbell</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), makes it unlawful to knowingly employ and unauthorized alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.142" offset="141939">Employers that violate the prohibition may be subjected to federal civil and criminal sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.734" offset="168375">IRCA also restricts the ability of states to combat employment of unauthorized workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.067" offset="193661">The Act provides that States cannot impose civil or criminal sanctions on such employers "other that through licensing and similar laws.”</text>
            <text syncTime="32.292" offset="234621">That's important language, “other than through licensing and similar laws.”</text>
            <text syncTime="36.939" offset="253221">Well, Arizona passed a licensing law known as the Legal Arizona Workers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.137" offset="274014">That law provides that the licenses of state employers that knowingly or intentionally employ unauthorized aliens may be suspended or revoked and in certain circumstances must be suspended or revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.748" offset="328453">The Chamber of Commerce of the United States and various business and civil rights organization, which I will refer to collectively as the Chamber, filed suit to block the law, arguing that it was preempted by federal law or IRCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.259" offset="386445">The Federal District Court in Arizona upheld the law and so did the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.347" offset="410791">Now, as just to explain, the federal law expressly preserves, not preempt state authority to impose sanctions through licensing and similar laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.413" offset="451124">That is what the Arizona law does.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.645" offset="460006">It instructs courts to suspend or revoke the business licenses of in-state employers that employ unauthorized aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.622" offset="495950">Now, the Chamber argues that when Congress said licensing, what it really meant was a specific type of license such as a license to operate a farm labor contracting business.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.139" offset="541926">But no such limit is even remotely discernible in the statutory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.925" offset="561152">We think it pretty unlikely that Congress would say license if what it meant was a license to operate a farm labor contracting business.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.892" offset="596992">The Chamber also argues that when Congress said that States could impose sanctions through licensing laws, what it really meant was that States could only do so after a prior federal adjudication that an employer had hired an unauthorized alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.855" offset="660835">But again, such a limitation is nowhere to be found in the federal statute and it is not our job to rewrite the law to put one in.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.696" offset="692182">The Chamber contends that even if the Arizona licensing law is not expressly preempted, it is impliedly preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.619" offset="723947">We will find implied preemption when you put the federal law and the state law side-by-side and the two really can't work together.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.351" offset="754876">In that event, the state law has to yield, but that's not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.087" offset="773789">Arizona statute simply implements the sanctions that Congress expressly allowed the States to pursue through licensing laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.798" offset="808584">And here, Arizona has gone the extra mile by closely tracking the federal laws provisions immaterial respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.623" offset="839931">The state law adopts the federal definition of who qualifies as an unauthorized alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.407" offset="863023">The state law provides that state investigators must verify the work authorization of an allegedly unauthorized alien with the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.825" offset="900744">The state law requires a state court to consider -- this is a quote, “to consider only the Federal Government's determination of employee status.”</text>
            <text syncTime="208.732" offset="940345">The Chambers asserts that employers will air on the side of discrimination rather than risk having their business licenses revoked by hiring unauthorized workers, but that is not the choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.515" offset="987470">An Arizona business has to do a lot more than simply hire an unauthorized alien to have its licenses suspended or revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.698" offset="1020176">The hiring has to be knowing or intentional and license termination is an available sanction only for a second knowing or intentional violation during a probationary period imposed for the first violation at the same business location.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.198" offset="1086213">The state law also affords employers safe harbors against liability if they comply with certain requirements for checking employee status, even if the employee turns out to be an unauthorized alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.266" offset="1142533">There's another aspect of the Arizona law that was challenged in this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.564" offset="1159670">IRCA also requires employers to take steps to verify an employee's eligibility for employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.272" offset="1186523">In an attempt to improve that verification process, Congress created what is known as E-Verify, an internet based system that employers can use to check the work authorization status of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.524" offset="1243470">The Arizona law requires employers to use E-Verify to check the work -- work authorization status of those that they hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.809" offset="1280669">Contrary to the Chamber's argument, Arizona's requirement is not preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.875" offset="1300940">The federal provision setting up E-Verify contains no language limiting state use of the program in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.675" offset="1332078">The Chamber argues that Arizona's use of E-Verify will bog down the operation of the federal system but the Federal Government has expressly rejected that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.793" offset="1372620">In fact, the Federal Government encourages employers to use E-Verify.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.049" offset="1389652">The Department of Homeland Security says the program is, "The best available means to determine the employment eligibility of new hires."</text>
            <text syncTime="332.736" offset="1436359">Now, of course Arizona hopes that its law will result in more effective enforcement of the prohibition on employing unauthorized aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.985" offset="1473348">But in preserving to the States the authority to impose sanctions through licensing laws, Congress did not intend to preserve only those state laws that would have no effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.523" offset="1519532">IRCA expressly reserves to the States the authority to impose sanctions on employers hiring unauthorized workers through licensing and similar laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.732" offset="1556313">That is what Arizona has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.536" offset="1563523">It has increased penalties but only for truly egregious violations of the law and has closely track the federal law in determining who is an unauthorized alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.358" offset="1606886">If even this gives rise to impermissible conflict with federal law, then there really is no way for the State to implement licensing sanctions contrary to the expressed terms of the federal laws and savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.989" offset="1661325">And so we reject the arguments of the Chamber of Commerce and affirm the judgement of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.709" offset="1692254">Justice Thomas joined Parts 1, 2 (a) and 3 (a) of the opinion and concurred in the judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.083" offset="1717750">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg joined, and Justice Sotomayor has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.136" offset="1749932">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision -- or decision of this case.</text>
