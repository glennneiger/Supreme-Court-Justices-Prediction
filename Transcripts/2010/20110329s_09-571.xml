            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.898" offset="133057">Respondent John Thompson was convicted of attempted armed robbery in 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.264" offset="162523">Because of that conviction, Thompson chose not to testify in his own defense in his later trial for murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.899" offset="197005">He was convicted and sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.042" offset="209544">While Thompson was in prison, his investigator discovered a crime report from his robbery case.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.531" offset="239532">The district attorney's office agreed with Thompson that according to Brady versus Maryland, the prosecutors should have disclosed the lab report to Thompson during his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.083" offset="293763">Because Thompson's blood type did not match that in the crime lab report, his robbery conviction was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.905" offset="333051">Thompson's murder conviction was also reversed on the ground that the armed robbery conviction had unconstitutionally deprived him of the right to testify in his own defense at his murder trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.639" offset="391983">In 2003, Thompson was retried for the murder and found not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.912" offset="417061">Thompson then sued the district attorney's office for damages under 42 U.S.C. 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.264" offset="446527">He alleged that the district attorney fails to train the prosecutors adequately about their constitutional duty under Brady to produce exculpatory evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.296" offset="494592">And that this lack of training had caused the prosecutor's failure to disclose a lab report in his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.684" offset="528133">The jury awarded Thompson $14 million and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed by an equally divided en banc court.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.010" offset="569511">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.657" offset="592081">Under our precedence of plaintiff seeking to hold the Government liable for failure to train must show deliberate indifference.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.883" offset="624995">Deliberate indifference requires proof that policy makers disregarded the known or obvious fact that a particular omission in their training program would cause employees to violate citizens' constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.842" offset="684763">Ordinarily, a pattern of constitutional violations by untrained employees is necessary to show deliberate indifference.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.025" offset="721544">Thompson does not argue that any pattern of previous similar Brady violation exists in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.428" offset="751114">In Canton versus Harris, this Court left open the possibility that failure to train liability could be based on a single incident when the need for training was patently obvious such as when a city does not tell police officers about the constitutional limits on the use of deadly force.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.050" offset="833661">Today, we conclude that Canton's hypothetical exception does not apply to claims about failure to train prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.804" offset="868665">Constitutional violations are not necessarily the consequence of a failure to train prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.580" offset="903774">Attorneys are trained in the law and equipped to interpret and apply legal principles and exercise legal judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.061" offset="937629">Prosecutors, in particular, are ethically required to know and follow Brady.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.757" offset="960408">In the absence of a pattern of previous Brady violations that would demonstrate that further specific training is necessary, a district attorney is not deliberately indifferent when he relies on prosecutor's professional training and ethical obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.865" offset="1036894">A district attorney's office therefore may not be held liable under Section 1983 for failure to train based on a single Brady violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.552" offset="1083601">Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Alito joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.944" offset="1109201">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan joined.</text>
