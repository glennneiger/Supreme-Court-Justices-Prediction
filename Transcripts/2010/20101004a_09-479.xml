            <text syncTime="40.391" offset="265989">The Government, on the other hand, advocates a narrow construction that is not supported by the text and defends it primarily on the basis that section 924(c) supposedly should always produce the most severe mandatory minimum sentence for every defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1051.147" offset="4309013">That point actually demonstrates why the Government's justification for this limitation doesn't hold up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.734" offset="4343286">As the Government argues at one point, the reason to read 924(c)(1)(A) crimes is because the 924(c)(1)(A) offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.999" offset="4428340">Yet that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.649" offset="4435028">As this Court indicated in O'Brien, 924(c)(1)(B) is a separate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.601" offset="4454776">Well, if 924(c)(1)(B) can trigger the 924(c)(1)(A), the Government's argument about excluding other offenses that might be separate from 924(c)(1)(A) no longer holds up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.078" offset="4520709">The other difficulty with the Government's reading, to go back to the practical point, is that if you apply it just to 3559(c), it can have no effect because as a practical matter no one can serve a term of years after successfully completing a life sentence, which is what's required under 3559(c); and 3559(c) itself has a provision that, the 924(c) is the third strike for purposes of 3559(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.319" offset="4661666">That in turn just leaves future applications, and there the Government's scenario under which the language that currently has no effect might have some effect is nothing short of far-fetched.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.627" offset="4710881">It would require Congress to amend the sentence of 924(c)(1)(A) outside of 924(c)(1)(A) and not indicate how those two penalties should interact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1184.614" offset="4842851">We think that it's the more natural reading of the statute in part because of concerns recognized by this court in the United States v.

            <text syncTime="2370.817" offset="9587628">It increased the -- it created increased mandatory minimums for 7-year and 10-year offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.303" offset="9605601">So it would be odd to think that in the second half of a presumptively narrow exception clause, Congress at the same time ran in the direct opposite direction and had a substantial rollback of preexisting section 924(c) sentencing provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.829" offset="9675713">And that's -- to be clear, at the time of the 1998 amendments these Petitioners would have been subject to the mandatory minimum sentences that they received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.749" offset="9703403">They would have been subject to 10 years in one of the cases for the drug offense and 5 additional years mandatory and consecutive under 924(c).</text>

            <text syncTime="3298.780" offset="13299524">But if I could just point out the other anomalies, there are two other anomalies that we have not yet touched upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.351" offset="13321780">One of them is that Petitioner's submissions create anomalous patterns of floors of statutory minimums, as we've discussed in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.524" offset="13354486">If a defendant under Petitioner's submission, the principal submission, has committed a drug offense that carries a five-year mandatory minimum sentence and brandishes a firearm, it is -- carrying a seven-year minimum, the floor is 12 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.247" offset="13409343">If that defendant's drug offense is more aggravated and carries a greater sentence so that there is a 10-year mandatory minimum, the overall mandatory minimum, under Petitioner's submission, reduces to 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.370" offset="13445914">And there is the further anomaly that for offenses that are different, the Petitioner's submission is that the defendant will end up, although adjudicated guilty of a section 924(c) offense, with no sentence whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.530" offset="13498472">There will be a free-floating adjudication of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.065" offset="13508608">And because the defendant, let's say, is a felon in possession and is sentenced under the Armed Career Criminal Act, when the judge goes to sentencing, the judge, on Petitioner's view, says: I will give you 15 years under the Armed Career Criminal Act; that triggers the except clause, and therefore, I impose no sentence whatsoever under section 924(c).</text>

            <text syncTime="3376.696" offset="13611217">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.465" offset="13618218">My point about the anomaly is just that it is very strange, to my knowledge unheard of, to have a judge go to sentencing and have a series of adjudications and to tell the judge as to one of them that it's not the greater or lesser included offense of another; you don't even need to impose a sentence on that adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.277" offset="13693555">The backdrop basic assumption is, on each of the adjudications, you impose a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.248" offset="13713408">Now, that is not true if offenses are greater or lesser or are the same offense, for double jeopardy purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.883" offset="13731903">But under Petitioner's submission, that is true with respect to offenses like being a felon in possession of a firearm and being someone who violated 924(c) that are different offenses in double jeopardy law and have always been given separate judgments, separate punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.625" offset="13786864">If the Court has no further questions, we would request that the judgements below be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3429.815" offset="13823645">I would like to make two points on rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.385" offset="13845901">There has been a great deal of discussion about the general purpose of 924(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.039" offset="13864500">But as this Court has indicated, the best indication of a statute's purpose is the statute's language, and although the Government argues that the sole purpose of 924(c) was to enhance punishment for defendants, the except clause belies that simplistic assertion of the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.684" offset="13939106">The except clause actually mediates the punishment that is provided in 924(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.321" offset="13961676">The Government's reading, at the end of the day, wants to rely on purpose in order to give no effect to the except clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.741" offset="13995321">The idea that 3559(c) is an instruction to busy district court judges, even putting aside the impossibility of serving an additional sentence after completing a life sentence, doesn't hold up, because the Government never disputes the fact that 3559(c) begins with the statement,</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.184" offset="14065121">"Notwithstanding any other provision of law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.184" offset="14073166">So the busy district court never needs to turn to the except clause in 924(c)(1)(A) to know that you impose a life sentence when the third strike is a 924(c).</text>

            <text syncTime="3505.610" offset="14126874">does that mean that Congress must think that there is some provision of law that falls within that?</text>

            <text syncTime="3578.569" offset="14418714">The last point I would like to make is that there is no doubt that regardless of one's view about mandatory minimum sentences as a matter of policy, no one doubts that Congress has the authority, if it chooses to exercise it, to stack one mandatory minimum sentence on top of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.678" offset="14483080">But as this Court's cases make clear, Congress, under the Rule of Lenity, needs to make that choice clear.</text>
