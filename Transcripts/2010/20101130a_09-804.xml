            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-804, Cigna Corporation v. Amara.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.570" offset="131699">Mr. Olson.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="7.954" offset="137237">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.622" offset="147895">Congress crafted a carefully balanced ERISA enforcement scheme that enables plan participants to recover plan benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B), and equitable remedies for ERISA violations under section 502(a)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="32.637" offset="235980">In this case, Respondents are seeking a remedy for misleading plan summaries that violated ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.791" offset="268581">Their remedy, if they were harmed by defective plan summaries, is under 502(a)(3), equitable remedies, not for plan benefits under 502(a)(1)(B).</text>
            <text syncTime="54.551" offset="323647">The section that governs the relief that is sought is a necessary antecedent to any of the other questions in this case, and ERISA carefully structures, and this Court has repeatedly said the Court is not interested and does not -- is not willing to alter the structure that Congress carefully crafted and carefully developed over the years to provide remedies with respect to ERISA programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.218" offset="434301">And the scheme is such that, if there is a participant to the plan who is seeking benefits under that plan, section (a)(1)(B) of -- subsections (a)(1)(B) of section 502 provides for relief under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.830" offset="500757">If there are other violations of ERISA, section 502(a)(3) provides for equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.916" offset="533044">That is the scheme carefully developed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.018" offset="545479">Now, in this case what happened is that Cigna changed its pension program, its ERISA plan, from a defined benefit plan to a cash benefit plan, cash value plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.230" offset="610367">And it put out, as required by ERISA, summaries of the new plan that the district court found, and the court of appeals affirmed, were misleading in the sense that they did not provide all of the information necessary for plan participants to evaluate what was happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.525" offset="691555">Now, the changes to the plan were lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.928" offset="705139">ERISA permitted and does permit these kind of changes to an ERISA plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.297" offset="726559">There was nothing unlawful about the plan and the plan change.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.201" offset="742233">And the beneficiaries, the participants to the plan, did not have any choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.169" offset="762086">Cigna had the right to change the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.371" offset="770863">It did change the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.890" offset="777028">It did have an obligation under ERISA to provide accurate summaries, and the district court and the court of appeals found that those summaries were not inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.829" offset="816734">In other words -- they were not accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.281" offset="826556">In other words--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="180.948" offset="829168">Mr. Olson, when you say the employees had no choice, but the district court found, didn't it, that the reason for this plan summary being misleading was that the employer, Cigna, feared that there might be a backlash on the part of the employees if they found out, if they were told the truth about this plan; that is, that it was less favorable, that they would not have the same benefits that they had under the prior plan?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="221.275" stopTime="267.402">
            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="221.275" offset="990501">--That is correct, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.625" offset="999905">They had no choice in the sense that Cigna could adopt a change in the plan, as it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.779" offset="1024564">That was permitted under ERISA, but it was required to give accurate summaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.981" offset="1041387">The choice that you are suggesting and the district court was concerned about is that an individual could have left the employ of Cigna if he or she was unhappy with the change in the plan, or the district court said there could have been some sort of a protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.256" offset="1102409">What we're saying is that the remedy -- what was -- what was the violation is the summary itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.394" offset="1126964">We're not -- we're not challenging that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.762" offset="1136473">That's a finding below.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.214" offset="1142324">The summary was misleading, but that makes it a violation of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.600" offset="1163849">The summary is not the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.468" offset="1171268">And--</text>

          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="267.402" stopTime="303.408">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="267.402" offset="1175030">Well, Mr. Olson, we have several times referred to the plan as having a range of documents associated with it, not as having just a single written instrument, but we referred to documents and instruments governing the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.376" offset="1230932">We did that in Curtiss-Wright, which is the case that you pin so much on.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.197" offset="1246187">We did that in Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.964" offset="1253292">And the statute itself talks about that on numerous occasions, that there are documents and instruments, in the plural, and one would think that the SPD is -- is one of those documents and instruments that govern the plan.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="303.408" stopTime="413.462">
            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="303.408" offset="1319016">--It's quite clear from the structure of the statute that is correct, as you suggest, that there may be multiple instruments or documents that are the -- create the plan itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.531" offset="1359559">But the summary plan document, the SPD, is not a part of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.251" offset="1382442">It is a separate document.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.703" offset="1388189">It is a summary.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.087" offset="1393727">It is a succinct statement of what might be in the plan, and it must be accurate and it must be written in comprehensible English.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.142" offset="1426014">But I would refer the Court to section 1024 (b)(2) and (4), which are on pages 3a, 4a, and 5a of the blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.200" offset="1474184">That describes the obligations that are required with respect to the summary plan document.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.270" offset="1498530">And it describes the instruments of both the summary plan document and the instruments that constitute the plan itself in the following sentence -- and this is a similar sentence in subsection (4), but I'm reading from subsection (2), which is on 4a of the blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.434" offset="1579196">It says: "Summary plan" -- it refers to</text>
            <text syncTime="372.819" offset="1596646">"a summary plan description and the latest annual report and/or -- and the bargaining agreement, trust agreement, contract or other instruments under which the plan was established. "</text>
            <text syncTime="386.395" offset="1650981">The construction of that sentence has to be that the summary plan description is a separate document.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.149" offset="1678043">It is not one of those latter category of documents under which the plan was established.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.037" offset="1697583">And the proof of that, if English doesn't teach it to us, which I think it does, is the reference to the annual report.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.976" offset="1733319">No one would say and no one would contend that the annual report is a part of the instruments creating the plan.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="413.462" offset="1759232">Well, I was struck by something else, Mr. Olson.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.931" offset="1769159">I was struck by the fact that the -- that the statute saying what is in the summary plan description is packed with information that needs to be in the summary plan description.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.222" offset="1814298">By contrast, the written instrument, which you equate to the plan, the written instrument says barely anything about what has to be in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.976" offset="1845332">It just says the name of the fiduciaries has to be in the written instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.512" offset="1859438">So it seems clear that this statute is set up so that everything that is important, everything that the employee needs to know and needs to rely upon, is supposed to be in the SPD, not necessarily in the written instrument.</text>

          <turn speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="451.921" stopTime="478.989">

            <text syncTime="451.921" offset="1913145">Well, the written instruments, as these things turn out, are long, complex documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.758" offset="1936447">They may be 90, 100 pages long.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.627" offset="1947941">The summary, as you suggest, Congress said, yes, there is a separate document that must state in intelligible English that plan participants can understand the following things, and they must be furnished to plan participants, but they are not the plan document.</text>

            <text syncTime="522.699" offset="2196208">Because the statute seems to be written so that things are in the SPD which don't need to be in the written instrument.</text>

            <text syncTime="547.464" offset="2295265">But the Curtiss-Wright case to which you referred to in your earlier question also proves that.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.968" offset="2317312">Curtiss-Wright case talked about a summary plan description and said it can't modify the plan -- using "plan", "summary plan description", in different terms -- it cannot modify the plan, which is what the district court here held, unless the plan specifically says that it may be modified in a certain way and that the summary is an appropriate amendment to the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.416" offset="2411039">So the Court -- and this was a unanimous decision of this Court -- was referring to the summary as something that was separate, that might modify the plan if the plan itself allows for it to be modified in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.243" offset="2462344">Now, the government says that the summary plan description is a part of the plan and so do Respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.730" offset="2488362">And that's what the court below -- the court below didn't actually find that the SPD was a part of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.967" offset="2513335">The court found, on the latter pages of its opinion, that it was a modification, it was an amendment to the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.138" offset="2541965">That is inconsistent with the Curtiss-Wright case because in this case the plan itself specifically says that it cannot -- does not say that it can be amended by the SPD.</text>
