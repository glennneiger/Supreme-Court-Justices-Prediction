            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87540">The second of the cases I have to announce is No. 00-730, Adarand Constructors, Inc. versus Mineta.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.964" offset="119305">We granted certiorari in this case to review whether the Court of Appeals was correct when it concluded that the Department of Transportation’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program is consistent with the constitutional guarantee of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.820" offset="178760">In a Per Curiam filed with the Clerk of the Court today, we dismissed the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.857" offset="206867">The Court of Appeals reviewed a race conscious program that governs procurement of Federal Transportation funds to states and localities.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.942" offset="243230">We presumed that the certiorari states that we would be able to review this same program but upon full briefing and oral argument, it is clear that petitioner is challenging a very different race conscious program, one relating to direct procurement of Federal Transportation funds to private contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.973" offset="319403">Because this program is governed by a different set of statutes and regulations than the program reviewed by the Court of Appeals, there is no decision below addressing the constitutionality of the only program petitioner now challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.605" offset="377917">We are a court of final review and do not decide in the first instance issues not decided below.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.928" offset="407174">To do so here would be especially unwarranted since the Court of Appeals found petitioner lacks standing to challenge the statutes and regulations relating to DOT’s direct procurement program.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.725" offset="454404">Yet, petitioner’s brief did not challenge this ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.683" offset="474257">Petitioner points out that this case presents questions of national importance calling for final resolution by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.184" offset="508216">The importance of an issue, however, should not distort the principles that control the exercise of our jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.327" offset="540817">We find on the record before as to these principles preclude review of questions upon which we granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.191" offset="568298">We dismissed the writ accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.908" offset="575089">The opinion of the court is unanimous.</text>
