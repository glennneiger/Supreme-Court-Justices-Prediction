            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87372">The opinion of the Court No. 00-758 United States Postal Service versus Gregory will be announced by Justice O’Connor.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="8.225" offset="120182">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.869" offset="142752">After four disciplinary actions were taken against her, the respondent was terminated from her employment at the United States Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.565" offset="185592">At the time of the termination, the first three of the disciplinary actions were the subject of ongoing grievance procedures pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between the Postal Service and respondent’s union.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.887" offset="250899">The respondent appealed her termination to the Merit Systems Protection Board, which rather than holding off review of the three actions pending, the outcome of the grievance proceedings, the Board went ahead and reviewed the actions independently under the framework set forth in its case of Bolling versus the Department of the Air Force.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.157" offset="367927">During the Board’s review process, the respondent’s first grievance was resolved in her favor but petitioner did not inform the Board which found her termination to be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.335" offset="424665">On review, the Federal Circuit held that the Board may never rely on disciplinary actions that are pending in grievance proceedings in determining the reasonableness of a penalty on appeal to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.027" offset="487463">We hold that the Board need not hold off its review pending the outcome of union grievance procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.373" offset="520796">It may instead review disciplinary actions pending in grievance independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.452" offset="545142">Such independent review meets the Civil Service Reform Act’s requirement that the Board’s actions not be arbitrary capricious and abusive discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.147" offset="599894">No one has suggested that the Board has applied its independent review policy arbitrarily or that it lacks reasons for its approach, nor independent Board review contrary to any law.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.768" offset="654438">If the review under the Board’s precedent in the Bolling case is itself adequate, a question which is not before us, then the Postal Service may need its burden of proof under the Civil Service Reform Act by prevailing either before the Board or in the grievance proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.394" offset="728939">The Board’s statutory authority to review serious disciplinary actions taken against workers covered by the Act must include the authority to independently review the more minor disciplinary actions upon which the serious actions are based.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.048" offset="803545">And the Board’s independent review may reach a different result than that reached in grievance proceedings, but this is merely the result of the parallel review systems established by the Civil Service Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.870" offset="862791">Because the Board’s practice is not to rely on disciplinary actions instead of already been overturned in grievance proceedings, however, we remand to the Federal Circuit to determine the effect of the resolution of respondent’s first grievance on the Board’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.264" offset="928410">Justice Thomas has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
