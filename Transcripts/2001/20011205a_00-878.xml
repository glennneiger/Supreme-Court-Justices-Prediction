            <text syncTime="12.662" offset="204316">Yes, you are, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.754" offset="212675">Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The local telecommunication provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 introduced competition into local telephone markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.745" offset="260636">The act did so in sections 251 and 252.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.048" offset="277877">Section 251 imposes the obligation to interconnect, and requires incumbent carriers to enter into agreements that will provide access to their competitors to those incumbents' networks.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.643" offset="324270">Section 252 prescribes procedures under which those agreements, contracts, as they are, are negotiated, arbitrated, approved, and filed, and the act stops there.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.838" offset="377038">It does not go on to interpret... to discuss interpretation or enforcement of those agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.647" offset="400234">From its title through its text, section 252 demonstrates that Congress was silent regarding interpretation and enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.280" offset="434821">Nonetheless, interpretation is not unaccounted for, because into that silence, under preexisting law, stepped the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.705" offset="468466">That preexisting law, still good under the 1996 act, not preempted or repealed by it, provides that the interpretation of these contracts is a State law process which has been deliberately left by Congress to State regulators, including State judges, who will apply State contract law to those provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.178" offset="714435">Judges make mistakes in their reasoning all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.673" offset="724362">I do, too, and if you could appeal from the reasoning of an opinion, as opposed to the judgment, we'd be here 700 days a year, so... and I can't find a case where that happened, so is that... and I hope there's a conclusive answer to what I say, because it's terrible if the case washes out for that reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.378" offset="1375229">I believe, though, that we... that the district courts of the Seventh Circuit would consider themselves bound by the Seventh Circuit's decision, and we would have to go to court to litigate that, which we believe would be a violation of our immunity, and in addition, we believe that the jurisdiction would not be there, and by doing that we would essentially be being kept out, as we have been kept out of our State courts for at least some period of time, and in that sense I believe that there is a continuing injury that results from this.</text>

            <text syncTime="370.619" offset="1636140">The essence of what was going on was an attempt to review in effect a regulatory decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.652" offset="1668323">Why does that implicate immunity in the sense that we usually think of immunity in Eleventh Amendment issues to be implicated?</text>

            <text syncTime="397.895" offset="1745227">Well, but that's... anyone who loses a case has been injured by the actions of the judge who made a mistake of law, or by the regulator in a regulatory case, so that in itself doesn't take it out of the usual attempt simply to get review of a judicial or a quasi-judicial decision that you say is wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.300" offset="1826938">That's correct, Your Honor, but the result... the other thing that the complaint does is, it names the individual commissioners as defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.812" offset="1852956">It subjects them to the jurisdiction of the Federal court, and it raises issues as to whether... which we have argued at great length in all of our briefs, as to whether that violates sovereign immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.614" offset="1900185">It seems to me that by naming them the... those who are appealing are doing nothing more than saying, look, these people in their adjudicatory capacity made a mistake, we want that mistake reviewed, in the same sense that people work their way up through levels of appeal in the judicial system, and that certainly is not a classic example of the kind of implication of State sovereignty which the immunity doctrines and the Eleventh Amendment have addressed.</text>

            <text syncTime="532.445" offset="2283454">In some, maybe all States, if there is an appeal from a rate order the regulatory body can be represented by counsel and say, you know, we got it right, don't reverse us, but they are not regarded as parties to litigation in the classic sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="594.103" offset="2530154">But in State appellate proceedings from Illinois Commerce Commission orders, when the appellate court disagrees, it enters a decree that invalidates or in some way amends or remands the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.426" offset="2583444">That is not the type of relief that is contemplated in the full range of a Federal equity suit in which commissioners are named as individuals or even, I would submit, in a case in which the State commission were named as a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.709" offset="2632554">In this case, Ameritech did not sue the State commission, for reasons I'm not quite sure I understand, but we're willing to, because we're here, assume that the commissions are... commissioners are an acceptable substitute, but even in that instance, the order is entered by the tribunal, by the appellate tribunal on the State side against... an order is entered that simply supervenes the commission's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.244" offset="2726700">In this instance, Ameritech filed a complaint asking for the Federal court to enter orders that are specifically directed at the commissioners and, if they had sued the commission, would have been specifically directed at the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.822" offset="2772989">That is relief that we don't believe is contemplated by the statute, but we also think it's significantly... it could be significantly different.</text>

            <text syncTime="663.891" offset="2809247">It hasn't turned out that way in this case, because the district court and the Seventh Circuit have agreed on the merits, but it could have, and that was our concern, and that is why we are here, because we don't know how it's going to turn out in the next case.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.159" offset="2862327">Your Honors, these proceedings, interpretive of the contracts as they were, did not take place under section 252.</text>

            <text syncTime="1241.433" offset="5119412">Our position is that it doesn't matter whether it's a broader term, but our... that if it's not under 252, it doesn't matter what kind of action it is, and interpretations and enforcements are not covered by that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.492" offset="5163611">It's a very particular statute that goes only so far and no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.179" offset="5178448">In addition, it seems that that argument and the use of those words is somewhat inconsistent, because the United States suggests that the more specific terms in (e)(4) suggest that determinations must mean anything that happens in a case related to these contracts, but it seems to me if approvals and agreements in (e)(4) is a narrow term, then approvals and agreements, which is all 252 addresses, is... must be read equally as a narrow term, and it's inconsistent to say that determinations under 252 goes beyond that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2543.844" offset="10329064">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The complaint that Ameritech filed in this case in Federal court specifically alleged not only that the ICC had misinterpreted the interconnection agreements at issue, but also that its order requiring payment of reciprocal compensation for a particular category of calls violated several specific sections of the Telecommunications Act as well as several allegedly applicable FCC rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.221" offset="10486530">For that reason, our position, and I'm arguing today for WorldCom and several other companies who had signed interconnection agreements with Ameritech and also were sued as codefendants along with the ICC, our position is that the complaint stated straightforward preemption claims alleging ongoing violations of Federal law by State officials and therefore those claims were within Federal jurisdiction and also actionable notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.776" offset="10612754">Where we differ with Ameritech and actually with the final respondent AT&amp;T is on the question that was being discussed earlier, which is the scope of valid Federal claims in enforcement cases, and specifically whether a claim of mere misinterpretation of an interconnection agreement raises any Federal issue or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.158" offset="10690285">Our position is that in most cases, at least, a claim of misinterpretation of an interconnection agreement would raise claims only under State common law contracts and therefore has to be treated as a State law claim, but in terms of this case, since the contract... the complaint did allege violations of the statute and FCC rulings, there certainly was jurisdiction, we believe.</text>

            <text syncTime="3054.002" offset="12369750">My reading of these contracts is that they make... that they... and certainly in this case, the Illinois case, it specifically gives a definition of when reciprocal compensation will be paid, and both the commission and the two lower courts all said that this is not a case where there has been an incorporation of Federal regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.870" offset="12433175">This is a case where we can divine the actual intent of the parties, that these calls should be treated as calls where this compensation would be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.055" offset="12461910">And so what they said was, this is not an incorporation case, and I believe the contract in the Verizon case, to come next, is the same, that there was an intent at the time that was... that the State commissions have said we're going to hold you to... even though Federal law may have moved on, every time it moves on they say, if you agreed to something else, you're still stuck with it, and that's what the courts in both of these cases have said as well as the commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.917" offset="12545397">Maybe if I could turn, then, to the Eleventh Amendment issues, it is certainly our view that the five circuits that have said these cases present straightforward Ex parte Young cases, those circuits are correct, because they do involve, in situations where there is a Federal claim being asserted against an action of a State commission, either an enforcement case or an approval case, a claim seeking an order bringing the State commission into compliance with Federal law, and it is, I think, an ongoing violation of Federal law, because when they approve and enforce an interconnection agreement, or they enforce it in some way, interpret it in some way, they are then telling the parties that they have to live by that interpretation during the term of the agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3359.295" offset="13590922">We also have an... the invocation of the Larson case which was discussed by this Court in detail in Pennhurst.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.232" offset="13618612">Larson, I believe, is the case that you apply in a situation where you don't have Supremacy Clause considerations at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.416" offset="13647346">Essentially, what the Court said in Pennhurst is, when the Supremacy Clause is at issue, we basically allow lawsuits to proceed against all prospective ongoing violations of Federal law by State officials, but Larson provides a test that says where you're suing without Supremacy Clause considerations to enforce State law against State officials or Federal law against Federal officials, in that situation you try to differentiate between mere violations of Federal law and violations that are so serious that we won't treat the State official or the Federal official as an agent of the State any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.596" offset="13784123">That is not the test that ought to be applied under Ex parte Young, and certainly has not been applied in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.572" offset="13803976">We also have the Fourth Circuit's analysis in which it undertook an entire sort of ad hoc balancing test trying to weigh State interests against Federal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.150" offset="13842324">I think this Court is clearly on record as saying that in the Ex parte Young context we're not going to get into that kind of balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.046" offset="13869910">The balancing test of the Fourth Circuit I thought was particularly unfortunate, because basically what that Court did is, it looked at the merits of the case and said, well, we don't think that the Federal claims are very strong here, so therefore we're going to say there's no ability to sue the State under Ex parte Young, and that doesn't seem like a very helpful way to go about... thank you, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3458.970" offset="13989550">In response to questions from Justice Souter, adjudicative context really provides the reasoning that Ex parte Young doesn't apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.940" offset="14025495">Contrary to what Mr. Smith said, the statute doesn't say you can sue State commissioners in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.148" offset="14046288">(e)(6) doesn't reference State commissioners at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.891" offset="14057260">This case is in a sense more like Larson than Larson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.330" offset="14071052">Larson was not about whether the case... whether the authority for the contracting official came from Federal or the State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.667" offset="14096339">It was about the characterization of what he was doing, and the Court assumed he was wrong in what he did in that instance, and in this instance, in the adjudicative context, it makes even more sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.189" offset="14138448">Certainly with respect to, I believe, Mr. Smith's remark about a... Mr. Smith referred to the fact, or there was a question about the fact that the commission might dispute the application of the Supremacy Clause, and certainly, if a commission did that, if a commission declined to follow Federal law, that would be a different story, and undoubtedly there would be some ability to correct that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.563" offset="14215980">But the Illinois commission isn't doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.489" offset="14223607">As a matter of fact, the Illinois Commerce Commission has never tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.056" offset="14233952">This is, I think, correctly characterized as a quasi-judicial proceeding, not executive or legislative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.233" offset="14258612">It is not accurately compared to rate-making cases, which are much more legislative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.705" offset="14276479">This is adjudication of a contract issue regarding a particular contract, and in that respect I would go back... that would lead me to the last point I want to make, which is that this is a case about a contract to which the act does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.780" offset="14332799">It's interesting, Mr. Smith said he didn't think the complaint in this case would survive a motion to dismiss, and yet he's here arguing that it belongs in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.349" offset="14363101">I'm assuming that... and I may be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.500" offset="14371670">I don't want to speak for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.026" offset="14373759">I'm assuming that the motion to dismiss would be an attempt to throw it out of Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.273" offset="14386821">These cases, this case is a contract case regarding a contract to which the act does not apply, and section 252(a), which allows the courts to negotiate... allows the parties to negotiate contracts any way they want clearly suggests that they have the right to do so without regard to Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.862" offset="14457142">In this instance, Ameritech has put Federal allegations in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.358" offset="14475114">One of them is that this contract violates the act, but if you look in their brief, they'll see... you'll see that they say that this can't be restricted to violations of Federal law because in negotiated cases that would allow jurisdiction to move on to the... to move to what they call the vanishing point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.795" offset="14544914">We agree with that entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.225" offset="14550556">Jurisdiction over interpretation does go to the vanishing point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.465" offset="14567588">The only way Federal issues are going to come up in these cases is if State courts construe a contract in a certain way and then disregard Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.371" offset="14607190">That is not what the Illinois Commerce Commission is going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.162" offset="14618370">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
