            <text syncTime="22.086" offset="230630">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns how far the Federal Circuit can properly go in taking jurisdiction to the exclusion of the regional circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.492" offset="288204">In its recent construction of its appellate jurisdiction, the Federal Circuit has effectively taken the position that the defendant's answer containing a patent counterclaim acts like a super removal petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.171" offset="342956">The Federal Circuit says that if the defendant in a non-patent suit files an answer that includes a patent counterclaim, that pleading automatically removes the plaintiff's non-patent suits from regional circuit jurisdiction and transfers it to Federal Circuit jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.360" offset="415681">According to the respondent, that same pleading automatically has the effect of changing the substantive law governing non-patent claims in the plaintiff's non-patent suit from regional circuit to Federal Circuit law, and the decision below demonstrates that these principles apply even when a judgment is entered which doesn't address patent law at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.477" offset="508155">The petitioner respectfully submits that the decision below is antithetical to what the Congress had in mind when it established the Federal Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2956.162" offset="11966924">As respects this case, however, where... where we have a patent counterclaim, I think the Aerojet decision and looking at what went on before Christian... Christianson, looking at... at the Christianson decision itself and the analysis that that court did with Chief Judge Markey speaking for the whole court en banc, very carefully and thoughtfully gives a legitimate basis for why a Federal Circuit should have jurisdiction over cases where there is a well-pleaded compulsory counterclaim at the district court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.174" offset="12102969">Chief Judge Markey also noted at 895 F. 2d at 742, in all events, the Supreme Court did hold in Christianson or in any other case that for all cases and circumstances only the complaint and never a counterclaim can serve as the basis of district court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.153" offset="12182904">And under section 1295, the basis of district court jurisdiction is for this Court an appeal-directing mechanism.</text>

            <text syncTime="3035.211" offset="12283110">In response to your question, Mr. Justice Kennedy, there is no difference between different interpretation and adaptation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.069" offset="12326578">The respondent's position would call for this Court to retreat from Christianson and to adopt some special interpretation of arising under unique to 1338(a) that deviates from the arising under language as it was clearly adopted by Congress in 1295.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.787" offset="12393451">Secondly, with regard to the question of... of Federal Circuit choice of law, what Mr. Gowdey stood here... I just would call... call Your Honors' attention to page 94a of the joint appendix which is the district court's opinion in this case in which the district court says, Vornado... that's the respondent... contends that this change in the law exception is met because in Midwest Industries, the Federal Circuit expressly rejected the Tenth Circuit's Vornado I holding, ruling instead that a claim for trade dress protection was not barred by the fact that a product configuration has been claimed as a significant inventive element of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.085" offset="12586653">As part of its ruling in that case, the Federal Circuit abandoned its prior practice of applying regional circuit law on questions involving the relationship between patent law and other Federal law rights and said, quote, henceforth, we will apply our own law to such questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.022" offset="12650392">There is no doubt whatever that the Federal Circuit has recently and radically changed how it adjudicates trade dress claims, and it was the opportunity to try to take advantage of the... of the Federal Circuit's view of trade dress protection which was before the Court in the TrafFix case, and rejected by the Court in the TrafFix case, which drove the case that's currently before the Court, which isn't to say that the Federal Circuit can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.889" offset="12777869">But by doing that, whatever legitimacy could have been before it, even as a matter of common sense, Justice Scalia, in derogation of clearly expressed congressional intent, in 1989, the Federal Circuit has done a 180 degree U-turn in its approach to its choice of law in these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.298" offset="12851430">And therefore, the... a critical underpinning of the Aerojet principle has been completely wiped out.</text>
