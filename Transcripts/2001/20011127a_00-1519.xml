            <label>Mr. Austin C. Schlick</label>
            <text syncTime="10.585" offset="187757">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.982" offset="197266">Since Terry, this Court has held repeatedly that reasonable suspicion analysis requires a common sense evaluation of the totality of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.859" offset="232792">The decision below is fundamentally inconsistent with that rule because it requires law enforcement officers to disregard potentially relevant facts when determining whether investigative stop is warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.549" offset="275633">This Court's decisions in Cortez and Sokolow are especially clear in rejecting attempts to put categories of facts off limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.852" offset="308757">In Cortez, the Court held that a vehicle's route, the timing of its trip, and its capacity for carrying carrying illegal aliens together established reasonable suspicion, notwithstanding that each of those facts independently might be consistent with innocent travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.671" offset="372077">In Sokolow, the Court rejected a rule that would have limited officers' ability to consider the personal characteristics of suspected drug smugglers.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.301" offset="402588">The Court held that that sort of rule adds to the difficulty of applying the reasonable suspicion standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.212" offset="426203">It does not ease it.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.227" offset="430278">And the Court further confirmed that innocent facts, facts consistent with innocent travel, in themselves may together establish reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.376" offset="462879">In this case, the Ninth Circuit attempted to establish a rule that would bar categorically consideration of certain facts that the court deemed innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.770" offset="500495">That that rule presents two fundamental problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.434" offset="519095">The first is that it doesn't accommodate the subtleties of real world encounters.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.958" offset="537171">For every categorical rule, there would have to be exceptions and subrules, and even if law enforcement officers could be asked to master those, they would still then have to anticipate new situations, and those rules could not provide guidance when...</text>

            <text syncTime="111.741" offset="592342">Mr. Schlick, you said we'd- this is an area in which one can use one's common sense, and I thought that what the Ninth Circuit was telling us was that some items in that list under all circumstances wouldn't cast suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.750" offset="660365">And one was cert- had a certain familiar ring with me that when you see a police car, you slow down.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.024" offset="689517">This wasn't a car that came to a screeching halt or was trying to dodge it, and then it just slowed down.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.529" offset="715535">And isn't that a most natural reaction?</text>

            <label>Mr. Austin C. Schlick</label>
            <text syncTime="145.779" offset="728492">The problem, Justice Ginsburg, was that the Ninth Circuit didn't admit of situations in which deceleration might be relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.634" offset="759943">For example, in the Fifth Circuit's Villalobos case, which we cited in our brief, the law enforcement officer pulled in front of the vehicle that was suspected.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.998" offset="793380">The vehicle then slowed to drop back away from the law enforcement vehicle, and the Border Patrol officer in that case deemed that suspicious, that it appeared the vehicle had changed its speed in order to increase its distance from the law...</text>

            <text syncTime="177.127" offset="853880">And I thought what they were saying was that there was nothing suspicious about the slowdown here, and if that's all that you have, s- it it won't do.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.704" offset="904244">Justice Ginsburg, we read the court of appeals opinion as attempting to establish categorical rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.364" offset="926814">On page twelve A of the petition appendix, the court says, we attempt here to describe and clearly delimit the extent to which certain factors may be considered by law enforcement officers in making su- in stops such as the stop here.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.024" offset="973521">On the same page, slowing down after spotting a law enforcement vehicle is an entirely normal response that is in no way indicative of criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.770" offset="1008420">That that appears not to have made a possibil- of the possibility that deceleration may in some context be suspicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.771" offset="1036423">And indeed, in the Ninth Circuit's Sigmond-Ballesteros case, decided after this case, the Ninth Circuit interpreted its decision in this case as holding that only certain factors may be considered by law enforcement officers when making stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.158" offset="1093997">And it's it's that categorical rule that is inconsistent with the totality of the circumstances test.</text>
