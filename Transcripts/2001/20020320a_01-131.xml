            <label>Mr. Eric Schnaufer</label>
            <text syncTime="3474.349" offset="14049511">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.700" offset="14058915">I believe that the government's position is a bold new position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.332" offset="14073439">The government has not previously advanced except for in its brief that all circuits are wrong, that even the lodestar jurisdictions are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.610" offset="14098517">That no one can, no enhancements for contingencies can ever be permitted and so the agency cannot rely on the experience in the circuit lodestar to say that this method is the preferable method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.700" offset="14130908">Claimants need attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.505" offset="14142089">In these cases the government conceded that the agency's position, underlying agency position was not substantially justified without attorneys whose claimants most likely would never receive the benefits that they were due.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.786" offset="14183258">Justice Stevens, you asked about possibly about the EAJA of lodestar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.244" offset="14201126">There are many reasons why the EAJA, Equal Access Justice Act is not the lodestar amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.636" offset="14218680">The EAJA has an artificial hourly rate capped below the prevailing market rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.365" offset="14237592">The EAJA also often represents a settlement of the parties for the risk of litigating the substantial justification issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.970" offset="14264028">And so we cannot rely, just because there is an Equal Access Justice Act award, there is not in the case already a lodestar amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.546" offset="14302272">Then I guess I think it allows this Court to distinguish easily Dague.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.004" offset="14320139">Dague should not be applied outside of the fee-shifting context because as its request, a plaintiff should be able to pay his or her own attorney to take into account the risk of loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.515" offset="14370190">Justice O'Connor, I think was asking whether or not contingency could be taken into account by a district court in determining the fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.778" offset="14399238">I believe that if this Court can direct that the lodestar method be adopted to enhance for contingency reflecting the necessary contingent nature of the claim or the court can use a contingent fee method, there again looking at the contingent nature of the fee, regardless of which way the court goes, the court allows more than one method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.500" offset="14482099">I brief that the contingent nature of Social Security cases should be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.073" offset="14504355">The government describes dependence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.954" offset="14519924">The government objects that attorney fee awards would be arbitrarily different based upon the number of dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.847" offset="14547509">The government lost that issue in Hopkins vs. Cohen in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.934" offset="14563810">This Court held in Hopkins the number... thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
