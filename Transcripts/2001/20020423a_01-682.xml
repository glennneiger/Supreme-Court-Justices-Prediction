            <text syncTime="102.540" offset="550927">The court of appeals, in the decision being reviewed before this Court today, rejected that argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="112.365" offset="590216">But I... I do want to add on that point, Justice O'Connor, that in our view it would be a mistake to take respondent's suggestion that because my client took that position in the lower court, that this Court should therefore turn a blind eye to the City of Newport doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.001" offset="656776">It seems to us that it's quite analogous to a situation in which a litigant, for example, decided to argue only legislative history in the lower court and then before this Court... and then someone said, well, you're therefore constrained not to look at the words of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.199" offset="1177553">I... I would, however, tell you why I think the Court ought to address the broader issue and that is because, given the construction of Franklin that the Eighth Circuit took in this case, there is no good reason to believe that were City of Newport called to their attention, they would have come out any differently.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.647" offset="1839391">For all the reasons we've said in the brief and I'd be glad to turn to, the evidence in this statute is quite extraordinarily compelling that, to the contrary, punitive damages were foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.497" offset="1886725">Second, I... I wish I could be as confident as the Court's... as Your Honor's question suggests, that were this case to return to the Eighth Circuit with nothing but a ruling about City of Newport, you know, in its sails, that the Eighth Circuit would take that mandate and take it and... and come out differently.</text>

            <text syncTime="951.090" offset="3945069">The statutes at issue in this case, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and title II of the ADA, do not sanction the award of punitive damages which are, by their definition, damages in excess of that necessary to make good any wrong done.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.835" offset="4036080">Now, there are several... both section 504 and title II derive their remedies expressly from title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which operates as a condition on the receipt of Federal financial assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.724" offset="4083623">And it seems to me that... to us that there are several facets of the title VI statutory scheme which make it particularly inappropriate to infer a punitive damages remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.466" offset="4122598">The first is, is that title VI, although it's silent with respect to a compensatory remedy, expressly provides for punitive and regulatory measures in the event that the violation of its nondiscrimination provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.130" offset="4177246">In particular, the statute provides for a termination of Federal funding, which this Court has itself recognized is a very severe... severe remedy that can have a powerful deterrent effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.071" offset="4221027">In addition, the statute authorizes administrative enforcement actions, actions that... in which the regulatory agencies, who have responsibility for enforcing section 504 and title II, can take remedial action, order remedial action, short of funding termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.136" offset="4281318">Now, the second aspect of title VI and title VI statutory scheme it seems to us to be quite pertinent is that punitive damages are themselves antithetical to Spending Clause legislation like title VI because the availability of unbounded punitive damages awards can actually have the effect of diverting resources from achieving the important objectives of the underlying spending programs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1141.391" offset="4706278">And secondly, what's important, we think, about the Smith case, in which this Court recognized a punitive damages remedy under section 1983... is that in that case, the Court didn't start with the presumption that punitive damages were available and simply look to see if Congress had said otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.397" offset="4774301">And that's the presumption that the court of appeals applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.824" offset="4788093">Instead, the Court purported to engage in an inquiry of Congress's intent and... and focused on the fact that when... when Congress enacted section 1983, it made very clear that it was adopting a special species of tort liability looking to the... the State common law at the time which provided for punitive damages there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1324.195" offset="5437497">It would be a quantum leap for this Court to extend the Franklin principle to punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.629" offset="5459231">Punitive damages, the Court has recognized, are both quasi-criminal, unpredictable, and at times have a devastating effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.348" offset="5490160">Those characteristics of punitive damages make them uniquely suited for careful legislative judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.209" offset="5513566">Congress in section 504 and title II has not made any legislative judgment that punitive damages should be available, and therefore, this Court should reverse the decision below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1602.157" offset="6549373">But this Court actually addressed a similar situation in the Darrone case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.193" offset="6569540">The issue there was the remedies available under section 504 for a case of employment discrimination, and 504 in turn incorporates the remedies available under title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.976" offset="6616665">Title VI said there is no remedy available for employment discrimination under title VI except with regard to a Federal program where the funding is for employment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.622" offset="6671208">This Court said that by incorporating the title VI remedies, section 504 did not incorporate that limitation on the remedial scheme that had nothing to do with the policies underlying section 504 which were to eliminate discrimination against the handicapped more broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.487" offset="6746650">Similarly, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the... the purpose of that act is to extend even further than 504 the prohibition on and the remedies for discrimination against persons with disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.854" offset="6804119">And to import into that statutory scheme a limit on relief that... that would pull it back and... and restrict it to what's appropriate on a Spending Clause measure would be inappropriate under, I think, the mode of analysis this Court used in Darrone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.149" offset="6873396">But in any event, even if one looks only at section 504, the Spending Clause analogy to contract doesn't limit remedies available to contractual remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.236" offset="6925745">This Court I think made clear, both in Franklin and then more recently in Davis v. Monroe County, that although the obligation that an entity may undertake under the Spending Clause is contractual in the sense that it's voluntary and it has to be clearly stated what the substantive requirements you're subjecting yourself to when you accept Federal funding are, that that does not carry with it the notion that you're limited to a, quote, "contract" remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.586" offset="7043087">In Davis, what the plaintiff sought in her complaint was punitive and compensatory damages for injuries that had been inflicted on her.</text>

            <text syncTime="1932.688" offset="7871483">In title II, Congress simply incorporated by reference an action for legal remedies that this Court had already recognized to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.097" offset="7909099">Now, then in 1991, Congress expanded the relief under title I of the ADA, as well as under title VII of the Civil Rights Act for the first time ever to allow a damages remedy, either compensatory or punitive, for employment discrimination to which those statutes applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.049" offset="8000945">And what that illustrates is simply the history that Congress has been very wary about providing broad damages remedies in the employment discrimination area and in 1981, it relaxed that unwillingness to some degree, but then placed a cap on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.253" offset="8073775">But in title II, it's quite clear, from the original 1990 legislation, that Congress didn't impose that circumscribed set of employment discrimination remedies on title II.</text>

            <text syncTime="2510.689" offset="10183528">And I want to just start by expressing my understanding of what Newport immunity is in light of this Court's decision in... in the Vermont Natural Resources case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.085" offset="10229086">It's not specifically an immunity that is municipal immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.036" offset="10248939">It's an immunity or a... or a general presumption against awards of punitive damages against State and local governments as a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.407" offset="10286346">And... and what it says where it operates is that those defendants as a class have an exemption against a particular form of relief that is otherwise available against private actors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.667" offset="10335456">In the Rehabilitation Act amendments and in section 502 of the ADA, what Congress said expressly is that as to remedies against States, which are one of the entities entitled to the Newport presumption, they're subject to the same remedies under the statutes as are any other private or public entities, meaning if you can get it against a private entity, you can get it against a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.691" offset="10439528">And that takes away the fundamental premise of Newport, which is that governmental entities as a class are entitled to a special exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.129" offset="10477249">What these statutes say is that governmental entities as a class are entitled to no special exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.295" offset="10501909">And the City of Newport issue I think simply goes away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.804" offset="10516015">I'd also suggest that one of the fundamental premises of City of Newport is not present under these statutes, and that is that there's an adequate alternative deterrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.148" offset="10565334">And... and in this case, what we're talking about when we're talking about punitive damages as a deterrent, to answer Justice Kennedy's question earlier of Mr. Robbins, in this case the compensatory damages award did include pain, suffering, humiliation, and mental damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.783" offset="10631894">So, we're not talking about punitive damages here as a surrogate for some component of compensatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.711" offset="10655613">We're talking about it as a remedy designed to provide a deterrent that will assist in... in Congress's goal of eliminating discrimination against persons with disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.054" offset="10704932">And in... in Newport, this Court looked at the 1983 remedy and said, yes, punitive damages are an important element of deterrence with respect to civil rights violations that are subject to section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.696" offset="10767522">But we have a better deterrent which is the availability of punitive damages against individual defendants who actually make the decisions to carry out the... the wrongful acts that 1983 is responding to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.012" offset="10828753">Now, whether that judgment is... as to which is more effective, is correct or not, that's the line the Court drew in Newport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.609" offset="10859159">But under these statutes, that remedy is not available because section 504 and title II of the ADA make quite clear that they provide remedies only against the entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.362" offset="10910150">There's no right of action against a... an individual under title II of the ADA or under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.536" offset="10942856">So, with respect to these statutes, deterrence against the entity is all you've got and all you can rely on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.164" offset="10977442">And that's yet another reason why Newport's policies are inapplicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.025" offset="11000847">And Newport was very clear that beyond looking at the immunity, as... as it used the term, of municipalities as a... as a sort of standard to try to determine what the legislature was thinking about when it enacted the statute, the Court was also going to look at the policies of the particular statutes to determine whether or not immunity from punitive damages accorded with those policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.774" offset="11107845">And given the distinctions between the ADA and section 504, those policies are not served here by immunizing the... the defendants against punitive damages on... under a Newport rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.285" offset="11157896">I'd also like to get back for a moment, if I could, to the... the notion that what's going on in Franklin is limited to compensatory remedies and that... that the idea of... of punitive damages as one of the normal modes of relief offered by the Federal courts is not really what the Court was talking about in Franklin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.852" offset="11260191">I think that's inconsistent not only with Bivens where in Carlson v. Green this Court, I think, held that punitive damages are available in Bivens actions because, as one of the ordinary remedial mechanisms available to the Federal courts, they were particularly appropriate for the redress of constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.814" offset="11340021">The reason I say that that's a holding is the issue in Carlson was not whether there was a... a right of action for any relief at all under the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.363" offset="11390176">It was conceded that... that the plaintiff could get injunctive relief against an Eighth Amendment violation if there was a pervasive--</text>

            <text syncTime="2846.421" offset="11526431">I think what the Court said, in... in particular in Sandoval, was that... that the Court had backed away from the notion that for every right, there has to be a remedy and had gone to the... the Court v. Ash notion, that what we're looking for when we're trying to determine whether a right of action exists is congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.212" offset="11605634">But that was true at the time of... of Franklin as well and the Court in Franklin said that's a separate question from what relief you get when it's conceded that there is a right of action to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.351" offset="11662163">And similarly, in Malesko, this Court said, we're not going to recognize a right of action against this particular entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.153" offset="11693406">The question, when it's clear that Congress has made a right of action available, as it is here, and what form of relief is appropriate, is a different matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2910.527" offset="11782849">And what I'm trying to suggest is that that is not always necessarily so, that the Court may take a slightly different view some... now than it did 10 years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="2923.985" offset="11836661">And the question that... that we as... as lawyers are trying to... to deal with is... is how, in light of changes in precedent and... and changes in evolution of the Court's doctrine over time, what aspects can we pull out and... and hold constant or... or use to make arguments as to what the rule remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.131" offset="11917327">And to me, looking at Franklin, which was a case that... first of all, all nine Justices concurred in the holding at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.995" offset="11956720">Second, it came at a point where this Court had already evolved far away from the every right must have a remedy doctrine and was looking very specifically at whether or not Congress had intended to allow a right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.713" offset="12023594">But what the opinion for the Court said and even the concurrence said was when it's crystal clear that Congress said there's a right of action here, does... do we infer limits on our ability to provide appropriate relief when Congress hasn't given us guidance on that subject?</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="2988.258" offset="12093811">And didn't say anything about whether punitives would be appropriate relief because all Franklin involved was compensatory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.317" offset="12122023">Before that, it was thought that there were no compensatory damages under spending statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.973" offset="12144697">To clarify that, they used the phrase appropriate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.772" offset="12159848">So, we've never had any holding that under Franklin punitive damages would be appropriate.</text>

            <label>Mr. Scott L. Nelson</label>
            <text syncTime="3012.052" offset="12189001">That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.181" offset="12197465">On the other hand, the Court has certainly held that punitive damages are appropriate in implied statutory rights of action, the most notable being section 1981 which, unlike section 1983, is an implied right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.959" offset="12256606">Section 1981 doesn't say anything about creating a right for anybody to go in and get enforcement, and the Court has held not only is there a right of action there, but held as recently as the Pollard case, which I believe was last year, that under 1981 the scope of relief includes punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.649" offset="12335391">I think that what that reflects is the Franklin principle, that when there's a cause of action, when it's a cause of action such as these, that is, essentially a tort remedy, that the traditional range of relief that's appropriate for such rights is provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.368" offset="12402265">And that range of relief includes punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.811" offset="12415953">And... and again, the issue in this case is not whether on the facts punitive damages are appropriate, because that hasn't yet been decided, but whether ever punitive damages are appropriate under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.829" offset="12472064">And I think Franklin speaks to the question not in its express holding but its rationale which... which I believe has survived down to the present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.489" offset="12510725">Unless there are any further questions, I will leave it at that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3101.777" offset="12547819">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.141" offset="12553357">Let me turn... go back for just a moment to the 1991 act because I think its... its significance here is terribly important and quite a bit different from respondent's characterization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.037" offset="12596929">The 1991 act amended title I of the ADA and also the Rehabilitation Act to provide a capped punitive damages remedy available only to... only to nongovernmental entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.879" offset="12672266">This case obviously involves an uncapped award, indeed an award four times the size of the cap, applied only to governmental entities and not in an employment setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.841" offset="12716152">That's more than simply anomalous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.896" offset="12728377">It is, I think, completely implausible for reasons that I think go beyond what... what Mr. Nelson has described to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.070" offset="12761083">The fact is title I was enacted in its original form at the very same time that Congress was considering the 1991 legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.504" offset="12806745">Everyone in Congress knew that when they enacted in title I that there shall be the same remedies as title VII... everyone knew that at that very moment laying before another committee in Congress was the very legislation that is being characterized as the 1991 legislation, as if it happened much later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.037" offset="12888874">These happened simultaneously and everyone knew that punitive damages were around the corner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.139" offset="12909354">In my view, when you look at what Mr. Nelson called the timing of the enactments, you really have to read title I as if it enacted a punitive damages and capped and targeted and calibrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.968" offset="12964629">Title III also has a penalty provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.169" offset="12985422">Although it forbids punitive damages, to go back to Justice Ginsburg's question, it has a civil penalties provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.684" offset="13015515">So, the thing that is remarkable about respondent's position and the position you would be urged to adopt is that although title I of the ADA has a limited punitive damages provision applicable only to employment cases and exempting the government, and although title III has a civil penalties provision applicable only to public accommodations, title II, which is silent, shall have an unlimited punitive damages provision which can be applied against governmental entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.641" offset="13175280">And it is against governmental entities and only governmental entities that title II applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.589" offset="13215091">And City of Newport, I should add, doesn't change just how anomalous that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.789" offset="13215927">The Rehabilitation Act amendments go not one step in the direction of overturning City of Newport.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.134" offset="13249259">The Rehabilitation Act amendments say only this, that the States shall be liable for whatever remedies are applicable to other public entities or private entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.022" offset="13296802">It doesn't tell us what those shall be, and in our view punitive damages aren't available against anybody under title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.164" offset="13325432">So, it... it hardly advances respondent's position to say that there shall be applicable to the States whatever is applicable to anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.762" offset="13355838">The other thing is, what are those other public entities if not, among other things, municipal governments like my client?</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.177" offset="13381438">By carving out, in other words, municipal governments, the 1986 amendment is a very strange way to overrule the doctrine in... in City of Newport, and I would respectfully suggest that it does no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.053" offset="13444968">Let me... let me end with this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.736" offset="13455731">And we haven't... we haven't mentioned the history of judicial interpretation of title VI and section 504, which had never... never, not once... ever been construed to permit punitive damages at any of the times in history that these statutes were meticulously amended and... and previous remedy provisions incorporated going forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.604" offset="13547159">But I do want to end with where Mr. Nelson began.</text>
