            <text syncTime="1145.765" offset="4732464">But it treated the question of whether or not Mr. Zandford was also liable under Section 10(b) as a different question requiring a specific proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.189" offset="4766110">And it is that proof that the Court found wanting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.540" offset="4775514">In that regard, I think it's also important that one of the pivotal factors in our theory of the case was that this was a discretionary account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.598" offset="4803726">And the SEC was relying on the bare facts alleged in the wire fraud indictment to prove its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.369" offset="4830893">And under those circumstances, there was no investment decision being made by the victims in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.859" offset="4852836">And we argued to the Court below and we submit to this Court that that's a pivotal distinction in 10(b) context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.803" offset="4876555">Because 10(b) deals with investment decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.653" offset="4888049">And if no one is being defrauded in the decision they are making as to the purchase or sale, all that leaves the SEC with in this case is the conversion of the proceeds.</text>
