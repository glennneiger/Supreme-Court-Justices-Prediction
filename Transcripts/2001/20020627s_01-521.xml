            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87518">The opinion of the Court in No. 01-521, Republican Party of Minnesota versus White will be announced by Justice Scalia.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="9.110" offset="123880">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.811" offset="146659">There is a long tradition in this country of the states selecting their judges by popular election.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.484" offset="169438">Vermont did so even before the founding of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.552" offset="185634">By the time of the Civil War, the great majority of the states did so and they continue to do so today.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.309" offset="208726">Minnesota is one of those states.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.258" offset="216458">Ever since its admission to the Union in 1858, the Minnesota constitution has provided for the selection of all state judges by popular election.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.138" offset="256060">Beginning in 1924, the American Bar Association began to promulgate model codes of judicial conduct that included restrictions on what candidates for judicial office could say during their election campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.274" offset="308514">The states slowly adapted these restrictions not by legislation but by decree of State Supreme Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.059" offset="335681">One of these restrictions is known as the announce clause and it was adapted by the Minnesota Supreme Court in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.297" offset="372671">The announce clause prohibits candidates for judicial election incumbent judges and challengers alike from “announcing their views on disputed legal or political issue”.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.373" offset="428991">What this means is that the candidates cannot state their views even in response to questions on any specific non-fanciful legal question within the providence of the courts for which they are running.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.571" offset="485729">Indeed, the Judicial Board in Minnesota has printed a list of pre-approved questions which judicial candidates are allowed to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.402" offset="521046">These include how the candidate feels about Commerce in the courtroom, how he would go about reducing the case load, and how the court’s cause of judicial administration could be reduced, how he proposes to insure that minorities and women are treated more fairly by the court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.292" offset="588651">Petitioners who include Gregory Wersal, an erstwhile candidate for Associate Justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court sued respondents, several state officials who enforced the announce clause, seeking a declaration of the clause violates the First Amendment and an injunction against its enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.880" offset="667018">The District Court upheld the constitutionality of the clause and granted summary judgment in favor of respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.849" offset="690842">The Eight Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.542" offset="697634">We now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.519" offset="705575">The announce clause is a content-based regulation that burdens a category of speech at the core of our First Amendment freedom’s; speech about the qualifications of candidates for public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.979" offset="759387">Accordingly, in order to pass constitutional master, the clause must satisfy our strict scrutiny test.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.822" offset="786764">Under this test, respondents have the burden to prove that the clause is: one, narrowly tailored in order to, number two, serve a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.061" offset="835665">Respondents assert that the announce clause serves two compelling state interests, namely: preserving the impartiality of the state judiciary and preserving the appearance of that impartiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.003" offset="883521">Under any definition of impartiality, we conclude the announce clause clearly does not survive strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.504" offset="913510">The traditional meaning of impartiality is a lack of bias for or against either party to a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.162" offset="940155">That is the sentencing which the term is used when the cases sighted by respondents for the proposition that an impartial judge is essential to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.288" offset="976622">It is obvious that the announce clause is not narrowly tailored to serve either this sort of impartiality or its appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.886" offset="1010999">The clause does not restricts speech for or against particular parties but rather speech for or against particular issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.890" offset="1047048">To be sure when a case arises that turns on a legal issue on which a judge as a candidate has taken a particular stand, the party taking the opposite stand is likely to lose but not because of any bias against that party.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.645" offset="1102009">Any party taking that position is just as likely to lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.806" offset="1118728">Another possible meaning of impartiality, though certainly not a common one, is the lack of preconception in favor or against a particular legal view.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.492" offset="1165435">The announce clause may well further impartiality in this sense, but it is obvious that achieving this sort of impartiality is not a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.839" offset="1202842">It is virtually impossible to find a judge who has not formed at least some tentative answers to substantive legal questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.747" offset="1230427">Indeed, if we are possible to find judges with minds that were empty slates, it would hardly be desirable to appoint them.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.176" offset="1264178">This brings us to the third possible, and again uncommon, meaning of impartiality namely open-mindedness.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.734" offset="1298450">Open-mindedness demands not that the judge have no pre-conceptions on legal issues but that he would be willing to consider opposing views and remain open to persuasion when the issues arise in a pending case.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.084" offset="1343799">Respondents argue that the announce clause serves the interest in open-mindedness or at least its appearance because it relieves a judge from the pressure to rule a certain way in order to maintain consistency with statements he has previously made.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.015" offset="1403567">We need not decide however, whether achieving impartiality in this sense is a compelling state interest because we do not believe the Minnesota Supreme Court adapted the announce clause in order to serve that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.135" offset="1452050">Statements made during election campaigns are an infinitesimal portion of the public commitments to legal positions that judges or would be judges undertake.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.750" offset="1494473">Before they arrive on the bench and even more frequently while they are on the bench, candidates and judges commit themselves on legal issues that they must later rule upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.092" offset="1531880">Under the announce clause, a candidate for judicial office may not say, I think it is unconstitutional for the legislature to prohibit same sex marriages, but, he may say the very same thing up until the day before he declares himself to be a candidate, and he may say it repeatedly after he is elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.284" offset="1616622">As a means of pursuing the objective of open-mindedness, the announce clause is willfully under inclusive as to render belief in that purpose a challenge to the credulous.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.788" offset="1662597">The dissenters say that statements made during the campaign are different, that they are somehow specially binding on the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.932" offset="1703244">Well, that might be true with regard to campaign promises.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.598" offset="1717872">I promise I will rule such and such way if elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.928" offset="1735218">I say that may be true; I think you have to be a little naïve to think that campaign promises are among more binding of human legal commitments, but it might be true with regard to campaign promises.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.431" offset="1797180">But the Minnesota Supreme Court has adapted a separate prohibition on campaign pledges and promises, which is not challenged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.681" offset="1830199">So even if one believes that campaign promises are specially binding, that would not justify the announce rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.390" offset="1852978">The dissenters also say that our opinion today assumes that judicial elections and elections for the political branches must be governed by the same rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.006" offset="1883489">We say no such things.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.559" offset="1889654">There can be different rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.300" offset="1896654">But as our cases have long held, any such rules that prevent the expression of views must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, and that requirement has not been met here.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.888" offset="1943048">There is an obvious tension between the provision of the Minnesota constitution that requires the election of all state judges and the Minnesota Supreme Court’s announce clause which places most subjects of interest to the voters, who elect judges, off limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.656" offset="2006055">The disparity is perhaps unsurprising since the American Bar Association which originated the announce clause has long been an opponent of judicial election.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.875" offset="2042940">Then opposition may be well-taken, but the First Amendment does not permit it to achieve its goals by leaving the principle of elections in place while preventing candidates from discussing what the elections are about.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.157" offset="2092050">We have never allowed the government to prohibit candidates from communicating relevant information to voters during an election, and we do not begin doing so today.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.191" offset="2128204">I will conclude this summary as I concluded the analytical portion of the opinion with a quotation from Justice Marshall -- the second Justice Marshall not the first -- in a related case, Thurgood Marshall wrote, "The greater power to dispense with elections all together does not include the lesser power to conduct elections under conditions of state-imposed voter ignorance.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.796" offset="2222662">If the State chooses to tap the energy and the legitimizing power of the democratic process, it must accord the participants in that process the First Amendment rights that attach to their roles."</text>
            <text syncTime="547.742" offset="2278460">Justice O’Connor and Justice Kennedy have filed concurring opinions; Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer have joined.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="559.404" stopTime="1024.026">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="559.404" offset="2325062">I also have filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens, Souter, and Breyer have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.716" offset="2382323">Whether state or federal elected or appointed, judges have a role fundamentally different from that of legislators or executive officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.440" offset="2429239">Judges do not act on behalf of particular persons, communities, or parties, they serve no faction or constituency, they must drive to do what is legally right in each individual case, all the more so, to borrow the Chief Justice’s words, when the result is not the one the home crowd wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.795" offset="2530698">Minnesota, like most states that gives citizens a voice in selecting judges has installed controls enabling the public to comprehend that judges speak in the name of the law and not as political actors.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.393" offset="2593079">All judicial elections in Minnesota are non-partisan.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.542" offset="2609588">Candidates may not seek or accept endorsements from political parties, attend political gatherings, or identify themselves as members of a political organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.180" offset="2660161">They may make no pledges concerning their conduct in office and under the announce clause, at issue here, they may not publicize how they would decide issues likely to come before them as judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.195" offset="2716272">They may, however, say a great many things of large interest to voters; they may convey information about themselves and describe their conception of the role of a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.103" offset="2763920">Among approved topics they may address are the criteria for departing from the sentencing guidelines, the remedies for racial and gender bias, the balance between free-speech rights, and the need to control hate crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.253" offset="2828494">They may criticize or defend past decisions of any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.239" offset="2852422">What they may not do simply or with sophistication is remove themselves from the constraints characteristics of the judicial office and declare how they would decide an issue without regard to the particular context in which it is presented sounds briefs oral argument, and as to an appellant bench, the benefit of their colleague’s analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.120" offset="2959942">In striking down the announce clause the Court, as I see it, grievously errs in two respects: First, in homing in on the announce clause, the court scarcely attendance to the essential differences separating judicial office from political seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.794" offset="3030682">If Minnesota opts to elect its judges the court suggests, it may not reign in what candidates say.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.093" offset="3059835">Today’s opinion places unqualified reliance on prior decisions of this Court on elections for legislative and executive posts including the case with the words from Justice Marshall that Justice Scalia just quoted, the Court today affords no clue concerning what manner of judicial campaign regulations might survive the high First Amendment threshold the Court applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.401" offset="3197030">I do not agree that an election is an election; I would sharply differentiate elections for political office, in which the First Amendment holds course way, from elections designed to select those whose office it is to administer justice without respect to persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.340" offset="3288876">Minnesota did not choose a judicial election system with all the trappings of legislative and executive races, while providing for public participation, it tailored its judicial elections to fit the character of third branch office holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.478" offset="3353347">The balance the State sought to achieve allowing the people to elect judges but safeguarding the process so that the integrity of the judiciary would not be compromised should encounter First Amendment shawl as a written dissent develops.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.929" offset="3423146">Second, the Court fails to give due way to the function the announce clause was designed to serve, together with the companion provision prohibiting candidates from making pledges or promises of conduct in office, a provision, all parties to this case agree is constitutional, the announce clause aims to safeguard judicial impartiality in both fact and appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.926" offset="3539129">Election-driven commitment to certain positions however common place and races for the political branches, are incompatible with the judicial role.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.440" offset="3581239">They compromise the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of due process of law for they place pressure on the judge to resist the pleas of litigants who make arguments the judge has promised to reject.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.713" offset="3634320">Judicial campaign commitments also undermine the very source of the judiciary’s authority, public confidence in the integrity of those who don the robe.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.148" offset="3684057">Commitments to rule this way or that convey the impression of unseemly quid pro quo the judicial candidate’s promises on issues in return for the electorate's votes at the polls.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.221" offset="3744347">Such an exchange inevitably diminishes the public's faith in the capacity of judges to administer the law without regard to personal or political self-interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.146" offset="3796070">Working in tandem with the announce clause, the announce clause and pledges or promises prohibition together, goes to avert peace between evils.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.868" offset="3846956">The announce clause targets statements that do not technically qualify as pledges or promises but nevertheless publicly made known how the candidate would decide legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.287" offset="3892618">The clause thereby prevents what would otherwise be an easy end run around the letter and spirit of its companion provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.611" offset="3933892">Without the announce clause in other words, the no-promises or pledges clause would be feeble an arid form, a matter of no real importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.992" offset="3975479">Judges are not political actors and the First Amendment does not require that they be treated as politicians simply because they are elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.127" offset="4011946">For more than three quarters of the century, States like Minnesota have endeavored to experiment tested by experience to balance the strong constitutional interest in judicial integrity and free expression within the unique setting of an elected bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.439" offset="4085193">The announce clause, borne of this long effort, comes to this court bearing a weighty title of respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.772" offset="4114555">In accord with the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit, I would uphold the provision as an essential component in Minnesota’s accommodation of the complex and competing concerns in this sensitive area.</text>
