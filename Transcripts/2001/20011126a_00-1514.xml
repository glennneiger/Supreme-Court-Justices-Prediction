            <text syncTime="10.114" offset="186883">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1367 is a constitutional and sensible response by Congress to the serious procedural problems that were facing the Federal courts prior to 1990.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.200" offset="239232">Those procedural problems arose due to State claims that were pending in the Federal courts at that time under this Court's, what was then called, pendent jurisdiction and is now called supplemental jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.058" offset="282595">The problem specifically was what happens to those State claims that are pending in Federal court when the expiration of the statute of limitations on those claims occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.058" offset="318644">The courts were faced with a dilemma at that point, do they dismiss these claims and risk having them not be refiled in the State court or do they retain those... the supplemental jurisdiction over those claims and decide issues that might be better suited for the State courts when they don't... when the Federal court no longer wants to exercise that jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="73.644" offset="441002">The problem with that solution, Justice Scalia, is that there is no guarantee that there would be an agreement to waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.643" offset="476946">The defendant is... it's up to the defendant to agree to that waiver and to say that they will... they will not bring up that statute of limitations defense in State court.</text>

            <text syncTime="104.108" offset="562837">There might be supplemental jurisdiction and the plaintiffs will not lose their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.907" offset="577988">However, that is just one court's potential solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.250" offset="591363">There were a number of solutions that were being attempted at the time with varying effectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.907" offset="614037">It didn't guarantee, across the board, that plaintiffs would be able to bring those State claims in Federal court and be assured that they would be... that they wouldn't be forfeited if the statute of limitations ran out.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.340" offset="659803">One... one possible solution to the problem doesn't make 1367 unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="148.858" offset="741828">To do that, the Court needs to address the threshold question of whether the statute abrogates in... in the first place, whether tolling is an abrogation of the State's immunity, and we contend that it is not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2672.892" offset="10837945">Any contrary indication brings into question the... the opinion of this Court in... in Pennhurst by suggesting that filing concomitantly in the State and Federal forums is somehow a due process problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2705.957" offset="10970229">And equally important, Your Honors, petitioners do not seriously claim that 1367(d) is a valid exercise of Congress' power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to address any supposed due process problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.415" offset="11024042">The record is simply bare.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.356" offset="11031774">Moreover, due process cannot be the basis of any supposed abrogation here because the first element of abrogating the State's sovereign immunity, using section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, is an explicit statement of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.185" offset="11087154">There is no such explicit statement of Congress here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.272" offset="11103454">In fact, the record is silent as to any due process claim either in the halls of Congress or in the... in the case law, at least as cited or referred to by... by petitioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="3123.345" offset="12639767">--It very well may be, as counsel for the University of Minnesota suggested, that States will have the good sense in those instances to waive their sovereign immunity defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.111" offset="12674876">I mean, the same principles that are going to motivate the Federal Government to pass the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act are going to motivate State governments to waive their sovereign immunity defenses in those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.711" offset="12721269">Now, it seems to me that... two points I'd like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.766" offset="12733495">First of all, it's worth focusing on the fact that even before 1367(d), the informal Federal court practices for dealing with potentially untimely State claims did not apply to nonconsenting States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.596" offset="12788770">Justice Scalia, you raised the... the problem of conditioning a dismissal on a withdraw... of statute of limitations defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.571" offset="12816669">But, of course, under Pennhurst II, a State has an absolute right to insist that the pendent claims against it be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.630" offset="12844881">So, in that context, the Federal court would not be able to condition the dismissal on a waiver of a statute of limitations defense, nor would it be able to retain jurisdiction over the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.381" offset="12879885">So, it stands to reason that 1367(d) should no more apply to cases against nonconsenting States than the Federal court practices it replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.752" offset="12917397">Lastly, I would emphasize that this interpretation of section 1367(d) does not place plaintiffs in an untenable position or in an unconstitutional bind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.776" offset="12961492">Plaintiffs, in cases where the State objects to Federal court jurisdiction as a blanket matter, have the same rights that they would have under Pennhurst II.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.245" offset="12991376">They can file both claims in State court, the Federal and the State, which seems a complete answer to any due process objections, or they can file parallel proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.668" offset="13025021">Even if the State makes a decision whether to consent on a case by cases, as Minnesota appears to do, the State... the plaintiff can still attempt to get consent in the first instance, and if it's not, it can make a protective filing along the lines that Justice Ginsburg suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.330" offset="13079669">In the end, it seems that plaintiffs lack any case law to support their due process arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.480" offset="13104329">I think that respondent, in fairness, lacks any case law to support its... its Article I legislative power argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.282" offset="13135572">There's really no need for this Court to make any significant case law in order to decide this case if it simply applies the clear statement test we suggest in our brief.</text>
