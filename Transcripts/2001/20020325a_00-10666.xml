            <text syncTime="20.023" offset="226806">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The petitioner in this case is asking the Court to rule that the brandish clause of 18 United States Code, Section 924(c) is an element to be charged and proved beyond a reasonable doubt and not merely a sentencing enhancement, based on two separate and independent bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.230" offset="311652">The first is the statutory analysis under Jones v. United States, and the second basis is the constitutional analysis under Apprendi v. New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.837" offset="350104">And I will address the Jones argument first.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.869" offset="362225">The carjacking statute in Jones v. United States had, as additional elements, serious injury and death, which the Court held to be additional elements after the statutory analysis was completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.707" offset="429516">And the carjacking statute in that case and 18 United States Code, section 924(c) in this case are virtually mirror images of each other structurally and grammatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.113" offset="475178">The Court looked at the text of the statute, the legislative history behind those facts, and how legislatures historically had treated those facts in determining that serious injury and death were, in fact, elements to be proved and not merely sentencing enhancements.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.208" offset="559502">Likewise, we contend that brandish, based on the... the text of the statute, the... how legislatures have typically treated that fact and the fact that it involves a mens rea element... that is, brandish is... is defined as displaying or making the presence known of a firearm in order to intimidate and... and mens rea has traditionally been an element... and then based on the legislative history that those statutes would lead the Court to conclude, based on the statutory analysis, that brandish is in fact an element to be proved and not merely a sentencing enhancement.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.319" offset="716027">But it's not so... it seems to me that... I understand your argument, but it's not so clear as it was in Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.793" offset="749882">I mean, the difference between use and brandish is... is a... is a smaller difference in degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.145" offset="775273">The difference in the penalties are smaller differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.377" offset="792200">It's just a couple of years, the difference between 5 and... and 7, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.425" offset="812367">And... and I understand how you can make the argument, but I don't see the argument as being sort of a slam dunk in the case.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Ingram</label>
            <text syncTime="173.026" offset="838803">Your Honor, if I may address each of those concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.435" offset="852491">The... first of all, the... the fact that the increase under the brandish statute goes from a mandatory minimum of 5 to a mandatory minimum of... of 7 not being a steep increase, first of all, it does take the defendant 40 percent higher for brandishing from 5 to 7, and... and it doubles the penalty 100 percent higher for discharging the firearm, which cannot be divorced from the brandishing element.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.573" offset="961056">There are cases from this Court in the context of ex post facto challenges to application of sentences that were enacted after the defendant committed the crime, most particularly Miller v. Florida, the leading case which we cite in our brief, where the Court held that an increase in a sentence of anywhere from two to two and a half years substantially disadvantaged the defendant and foreclosed the defendant from asking for a lower sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.073" offset="1082996">Likewise, in the case of Glover v. United States, which we do not cite in our brief... that is at 531 U.S. 198... the Court held, in the context of a challenge of ineffective assistance of counsel, that an additional guideline sentence under the Federal sentencing guidelines of anywhere from 6 to 21 months meets the substantial prejudice prong of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.209" offset="1179544">So, we contend that the increase from 5 to 7 years is in fact a... a substantial difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.659" offset="1209324">The elements in question, comparing serious bodily injury and death to brandishing, are somewhat different in that the serious bodily injury and death are results, whereas brandish and discharge are conduct of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.952" offset="1274525">But we contend that the brandish and discharge being treated more seriously are seeking to address the same possible results; that is, if a defendant merely carries a firearm or possesses a firearm, it is far less likely that serious bodily injury or death will result than if the defendant brandishes or discharge... discharges--</text>

            <text syncTime="322.693" offset="1437529">I just want to know if you think Apprendi applies to the second of the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.926" offset="1462398">The first statute says the sentence is up to 10 years for robbery, but if a gun is discharged, up to 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.041" offset="1506911">There's no question that Apprendi applies to that second.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.420" offset="1560409">The maximum for this crime of robbery is 15, but unless a gun is discharged, you shall not sentence to more than 10.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.677" offset="2653373">Prior to Apprendi, in... in McMillan and Patterson, the Court had acknowledged that there were some limits, some constitutional limits to what a legislature could do in defining the elements of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.192" offset="2703528">But it... the Court had never announced exactly what those limits are.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.256" offset="2715753">Now, it is true that Apprendi was limited to an increase in statutory maximums because that is what the case was about.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.129" offset="2747205">Those were the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.807" offset="2749921">But the constitutional rule that was the underpinning of the Apprendi holding was that as... as stated by the majority in endorsing the concurring opinions in Jones as follows, it is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed, and equally clear that they must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.424" offset="2856396">So, the constitutional rule of Apprendi was any fact that increases the range, either the floor or the ceiling, of the prescribed penalties are constitutionally elements that must be alleged by the defendant... by the prosecution in the charging document and must be proved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.226" offset="6583652">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court's decision in McMillan v. Pennsylvania forms the backdrop for both the statutory and the constitutional questions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.157" offset="6631299">As a matter of statutory interpretation, the amended section 924(c) creates one crime with a minimum of 5 years and a maximum of life in prison and then gives the sentencing court additional guidance as to where the penalty shall be set within that 5-year-to-life range.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.843" offset="6714055">The increase in the mandatory minimums does not run afoul of the Apprendi rule and is, in fact, specifically endorsed by this Court's decision in McMillan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.718" offset="6757627">And on the constitutional question, this Court's decision in McMillan 16 years ago established that it does not violate the Constitution for a legislature to choose one fact that has historically borne on the appropriate penalty to be assessed at sentencing and give the judge guidance as to what that sentence shall be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1695.275" offset="6927841">Under your theory of the case, the jury doesn't... the judge said, you know, I would ordinarily give you 6 months, but I... I find there's a harassment here... or pardon me... brandishing here, and so I'm going to give you 5 to 7 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.742" offset="6985729">True, it's a mandatory minimum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1716.293" offset="7011851">But it certainly seems to me that the concerns Apprendi... of Apprendi are fully applicable here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1722.757" offset="7037765">Justice Kennedy, there are several significant differences between the issue in a case like this and the issue in a case like Apprendi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.927" offset="7070470">In Apprendi, the judge could not go above the jury's verdict based on the Court's constitutional analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.160" offset="7103384">In other words, the jury sets the outermost limit that the judge can do, and in the sense of protecting the jury trial right, the Apprendi rule tracks onto what the jury must find.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.107" offset="7151136">Here, regardless of what the jury finds, the judge has the discretion and the authority to sentence the defendant between 5 years and life in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.757" offset="7193768">What the mandatory minimum takes away is not a jury trial right, but a right to judicial discretion to give a lower sentence than the mandatory minimum calls for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.864" offset="7238176">But Apprendi was not about protecting judicial discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.815" offset="7253954">Apprendi, in fact, limited judicial discretion and said that the judge cannot go above the maximum that the jury's facts have determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.201" offset="7291570">Here the judge is not doing anything that he could not do based on the jury's verdict anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.850" offset="7318111">All that is happening is that he is losing the discretionary power to give less, and that judicial discretion interest is not the interest that was at stake in Apprendi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.524" offset="7360847">That's reinforced by the fact that the history that this Court relied on, as one of its key determinants in the Apprendi decision, is not present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.198" offset="7403479">The history in Apprendi, the Court concluded, showed that it has been the rule down centuries into the common law that the judge cannot give a higher sentence than based on the facts that the jury has determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.697" offset="7457500">But there is no comparable historical rule that would support a preclusion of judicial discretion within the otherwise applicable range.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.475" offset="7496579">The history of sentencing in this country shows that within the maximum sentence established by the jury verdict, judges have been often given tremendous amounts of discretion on what sentence they should impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.047" offset="7554885">But the history of sentencing also reveals that legislatures have frequently intervened in order to establish more precise rules to govern that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.306" offset="7603890">And the... therefore, there is no broad historical rule that is contradicted by a statute like the one in this case and the one that was at issue in McMillan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.571" offset="8301046">It took an additional finding by the judge to send him into the realm where the maximum was now 20, and then he... Apprendi got 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.537" offset="8336886">In this case, once the jury or, as it happens, the judge... the defendant waived a jury trial... assigned a finding of guilt to the defendant, the statute said, your sentence, Mr. Harris, is between 5 years and life in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.460" offset="8400520">And the statute comes along and doesn't give the judge the authority to do something that he could not have done before.</text>

            <text syncTime="2118.284" offset="8619845">The difference in that statute, Justice Scalia... and I agree that that would not trigger the rule that this Court announced in Apprendi... is that as the Court's opinion in Apprendi notes, if Congress writes the second kind of statute and says the range is 1 to 25, it is exposing all defendants who are sentenced under that statute to a possible sentence of 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.694" offset="8709497">And the Court said that structural democratic constraints exist to deter legislatures from enacting statutes with more draconian maximum penalties than they think are appropriate for the worst of the worst who are going to be sentenced under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.378" offset="8768220">Now, here when Congress amended section 924(c), it went from a statute that had determinate sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.787" offset="8801866">Previously whatever you did under 924(c), the judge had no sentencing discretion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.292" offset="8823913">It was just 5 years or 20 years or 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.195" offset="8835511">Congress changed that and said this is a more serious crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.355" offset="8852125">This is a crime which, if you're convicted of it, you're going to get at least 5 years with an implied maximum all the way up to life in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.428" offset="8884413">By virtue of doing that, Congress envisioned that there would a spectrum of offenders under section 924(c), some of whom are going to be at the bottom of the tier and are just the least worst offenders under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.572" offset="8941046">They'll get 5 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.675" offset="8945435">Others are going to be the worst of the worst.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.098" offset="8955152">They are going to get a sentence that will be closer to the top of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.786" offset="8973856">Within that range, Congress gave to the sentencing judge additional guide points of how to exercise that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.609" offset="9005203">For someone who brandishes, that's a little worse than simply using; he should get at least 7 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.561" offset="9032997">For someone who discharges... that's an increment worse yet... it's 10 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2262.810" offset="9197987">Justice Stevens, it's unclear what impact this decision will have on the sentencing guidelines, I assume on the assumption that the Court extends Apprendi to mandatory minimums.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.336" offset="9240096">The sentencing guidelines are like mandatory minimums in certain respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.424" offset="9264442">They provide ranges, once the judge has determined by a preponderance of the evidence, the defendant's conduct and criminal history, that by statute the judge is to give a sentence within.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.676" offset="9317418">But they differ from mandatory minimums in that the statute further says that the judge can depart from the guidelines sentence based on an aggravating or a mitigating fact that distinguishes the case from the kinds that the guidelines' drafters had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.433" offset="9384396">Now, the guidelines are... are different primarily in that there is a broader range of discretion available for the judge to depart than there is under a mandatory minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.027" offset="9426819">I emphasize that this is a question of degree rather than one of kind because even these mandatory minimums under section 924(c) can be departed from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.165" offset="9467361">If the Government makes a motion that says the defendant has rendered substantial assistance to the Government in the prosecution of others, that authorizes the judge to depart from what is otherwise a mandatory minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.617" offset="9517203">That same ground for departure also exists within the guidelines, and it accounts for more than half of the departures that exist in the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.730" offset="9553670">Now, the guidelines do, of course, provide a further zone of less guided discretion to the judge in when he can depart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.796" offset="9585853">And if this Court rules against the Government in this case, we will be back saying that that zone of discretion distinguishes the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.534" offset="9616886">Whether the Court agrees with that or not will be an open question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2397.077" offset="9735064">But I... I do wish to underscore that there is... there is a range of ways that Congress can draft statutes and the States can draft statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.335" offset="9772054">Under the drug statutes, for example, there's not only the substantial assistance departure that I've mentioned, but there's also a departure for first-time offenders called the safety valve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.362" offset="9816148">Now, that adds an additional amount of discretion to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.265" offset="9827747">And any constitutional rule that this Court develops for mandatory minimums is going to have to be very careful in articulating how much discretion is enough in order to make the mandatory minimum no longer mandatory and no longer minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.605" offset="9885111">It could be that the availability of the substantial assistance departure is enough to take it out of a rule that says never means never, and if... if Congress says never, then the judge can't make the finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.671" offset="9929415">That is precisely why we urge the Court to adhere to McMillan v. Pennsylvania which held 16 years ago that it is permissible for... for the legislature to provide additional guidance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2522.565" offset="10236929">And the judge could still say, well, I think by a preponderance of the evidence, you did brandish, and exercising my discretion, I'm going to give you exactly the same 7 years that the statute called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.288" offset="10283845">The fact that that can happen shows, I think, that the right that's in play here is not a right to a jury trial that will protect the defendant against the possibility of this increased punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.964" offset="10342568">It is the right to have a judge with unlimited discretion not to impose the mandatory minimum even if he finds brandishing, because that is the distinction that I think both petitioner and I draw between the sentencing guidelines and this mandatory minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.410" offset="10416338">And the right to judicial discretion is simply not the Apprendi right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2604.155" offset="10563355">It doesn't have to be a substantial disadvantage that can only be proved as an element of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.724" offset="10589582">The ex post facto cases apply to the withdrawal of good-time credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.995" offset="10606718">They apply to the sentencing guidelines, as the Court held in Miller v. Florida.</text>

            <text syncTime="3035.586" offset="12289108">And, Justice Ginsburg, I... I agree with the suggestion of Justice Souter earlier that this statute is not identical to the Jones statute and shouldn't be construed identically to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.213" offset="12335606">First and most fundamentally, in Jones and again unanimously in Castillo, the Court commented that a statute that's written, as section 924(c) is written, has the look of the creation of sentencing factors when you start off looking at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.210" offset="12403525">In Jones, the Court then went on to analyze a number of structural features that suggested that the initial look was unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.635" offset="12433304">Here the initial look is reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.642" offset="12445320">Unlike in Jones where the additional factors, serious bodily injury and death, took the penalty from 15 years, first to 25 years, and then to life in prison, here the initial range of the statute is 5 years to life, and the mandatory minimums are fairly modest incremental increases in the minimum sentence of 5 years and 7 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.193" offset="12531525">But most importantly, what is different from the statute in Jones, the carjacking statute and the statute here, section 924(c), is in Jones the carjacking statute was modeled on three Federal robbery statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.278" offset="12591815">Two of those Federal robbery statutes contained serious bodily injury or putting somebody in jeopardy of serious bodily injury that were clearly offense elements, and the Court commented that it could see no reason... and the Government was unable to adduce a reason... why Congress would have departed from the explicit models on which it relied in drafting the carjacking statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.127" offset="12695260">So you had a firmer basis for concluding in the carjacking statute that Congress probably intended an element.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.767" offset="12721800">Here not only do you not have that feature, because there was no Federal antecedent for section 924(c), but you have the very important consideration that there's no constitutional doubt that should be applied to the construction of section 924(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.169" offset="12787420">Unlike in Jones where the Court held that a series of cases over 25 years had raised constitutional questions about increasing the maximum, here the relevant precedent, of which Congress is presumed to be aware, is McMillan v. Pennsylvania which gave the legislature fair warning that it could provide for the kind of statute that it's provided here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.856" offset="12878117">And for those reasons, we think that the Fourth Circuit and every other court of appeals that's analyzed the question is correct in concluding that Congress's approach in section 924(c) was a sentencing factor approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.420" offset="12928377">The question then becomes whether that is a constitutional approach.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.699" offset="13057526">Then in the 19th century, the legislatures and Congress and the State adopted a... a policy of having wide ranges and judicial discretion within them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.485" offset="13092635">Then later, legislatures moved to a system of parole boards and... and indeterminate sentencing in many States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.014" offset="13122728">And it was as a result of those processes that in the mid-20th century and late 20th century, a variety of commentators began to decide that this sentencing scheme that gives so much discretion to various actors in the system was not acceptable because it produced unwarranted disparities against similarly situated offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.125" offset="13207260">And at that point, to promote transparency, meaning we know what... why the judge is doing what he's doing, and uniformity, namely, similar offenders will get the same sentence, schemes came along like mandatory minimums and guideline sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.257" offset="13267760">But I believe that they were understood to be directions to limit judicial discretion, not to wholly supplant it or to be the type of statute that the Court invalidated in Apprendi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.468" offset="13316556">And it's really the petitioner's burden in this case to show that these sentencing innovations are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.118" offset="13351143">In Apprendi, the defendant was able to carry that burden by pointing to a long line of consistent judicial decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.639" offset="13377265">Here neither party can point to a long line of consistent decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.823" offset="13402029">What each of us does is argue from the background baseline tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.711" offset="13421569">Our submission is that judges have always had a wide range of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.567" offset="13437033">Defendants have never been able to rely on not getting a stiffer sentence within the maximum authorized ranges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.184" offset="13463469">Legislatures have relied on this Court's decision in McMillan, saying that it's constitutional for the legislature to structure that discretion, and we believe that the Court should adhere to that position today.</text>

            <text syncTime="3346.327" offset="13532014">Responding to the questions about the effect that a ruling in our favor will have on the lower courts, first of all, as noted, there will be no prospective impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.596" offset="13605053">The Government in the Federal context is already alleging drug amounts, is already alleging brandish and discharge, and it's a very simple matter for the Government and the prosecution, either the State or the Federal courts, to allege and... and prove these additional facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.217" offset="13667538">Retroactively, there will be some cases that will be sent back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.632" offset="13681226">They will not be sent back to set aside guilty verdicts or guilty pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.000" offset="13698676">They will simply be sent back for resentencing, consistent with the opinion in this case, just like they were with Apprendi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.913" offset="13722395">There's not nearly the flood of remands on Apprendi, and Bailey for that matter, as the Government contends, but in any event, however many there are, if the Constitution demands it, then so be it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.076" offset="13775058">The Government is concerned that a ruling in our favor will undermine legislatures' concerns about limiting judicial discretion in sentencing by enacting mandatory minimums.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.215" offset="13819570">Those statutes, the statute in this case in particular, and any statutes enacting mandatory minimums in... in the State courts will not go away with a ruling in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.882" offset="13870248">The only difference is that the Government will simply have to allege and prove the additional fact, further limiting the judge's discretion, whereas currently the judge has discretion to determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether or not a fact exists or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.479" offset="13936599">Once a jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that it does, the judge has no more discretion and must impose the mandatory minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.136" offset="13967214">And as has been pointed out and we point out in our brief and reply brief, we contend that mandatory minimums, as a practical matter, are far more important increases at the bottom level than the possible increases at the top of a sentencing scheme would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.469" offset="14036596">And finally, we are not asking the Court to extend the constitutional rule announced in Apprendi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.734" offset="14057703">Apprendi was limited by its facts, but the constitutional rule announced was that it is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increased the prescribed range of penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.561" offset="14109007">A mandatory minimum increases the prescribed range of penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.073" offset="14131054">We are simply asking the Court to apply the constitutional rule announced in Apprendi to the facts of our case and... and ask the Court to rule in our favor.</text>
