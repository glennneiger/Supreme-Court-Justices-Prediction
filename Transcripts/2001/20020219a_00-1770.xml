            <text syncTime="588.651" offset="2502077">And there is... the law of contracts is that a contracting party may enforce its lease... its lease provisions... Congress was surely aware of that... when it wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.731" offset="2534364">And ordinarily whether it's a Federal contract, a government contract, or a private contract, the court doesn't inquire into what are the reasons why you're enforcing your... your lease provision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.584" offset="2569786">They just inquire... or your contractual provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="707.771" offset="2978551">Indeed, both respondents in the court of appeals suggest that if the tenant... even if the tenant knew, if the tenant couldn't control the drug-related activity, that that would also be a defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="730.987" offset="3071442">But I think, in general, what Congress wanted was to give public housing authorities a tool that would be actually useful in remedying the very serious problem of not only drug... drug-related criminal activity but other criminal activity in public housing units.</text>

            <text syncTime="854.331" offset="3564738">But if that crime was that that person was trying to import drugs and bring them to that person's unit in the housing complex, it would be highly relevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="883.542" offset="3681662">And the fact that... it is true that Congress added leasehold interest to the forfeiture statute in it... when it... when it rewrote this statute in 1990, although it didn't substantively change the terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.656" offset="3742057">But I think the... it's very express innocent owner defense that's in the lease... in the forfeiture statute contrasts very sharply with the absence of not only any such defense but even any word that suggests such a defense in this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="950.384" offset="3948947">In fact, I think just the contrast between the statutes clearly points out Congress'... what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.886" offset="3974965">The... the... you know, I'd add that this... this... the rationale of this statute ensures not only that there's the maximum incentive for tenants in public housing to ensure that their household members and they themselves are not engaged in drug-related activity and to find out about that activity rather than remaining ignorant, but in the end, it ensures that households in Government subsidized housing who are a threat to their neighbors or who may be a threat to their neighbors in the view of the public housing authority, that they are removed and that... and replaced with others of the many families who are on the list who would not pose such a threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.048" offset="4123654">Finally, the court of appeals also relied on the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, but this statute is clear and there's no warrant for applying that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.526" offset="4161584">And in any event, there isn't any serious constitutional problem with interpreting it as HUD has.</text>

            <text syncTime="1046.976" offset="4335351">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In response to Congress' enactment of 1437d(l)(6) and HUD's regulations, the Oakland Housing Authority revised its lease to properly reflect the changes that had taken place with regard to the HUD regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.110" offset="4439840">And it specifically did that in three instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.064" offset="4451752">It revised the lease at paragraph 9(m) and it revised the occupants' responsibility statement, and then it revised what is known as the tenant agreement to maintain a drug-free environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.635" offset="4502012">In each instance, it... it advised each tenant and requested each tenant to sign a statement acknowledging that they clearly understood that if this type of conduct took place within their apartment or off housing authority property, that they could be subjected to a lease cancellation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.728" offset="4570348">In this case, we came forward with four individuals whose leases were canceled because of this particular type of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.104" offset="4599919">And the housing authority's position is it was necessary for it to take the action with regard to each one of these particular individuals because of the conduct that they were participating in or the conduct of individuals in their households were participating in, which conduct which posed a significant risk of injury to other members of the housing authority and to the community in which these particular developments are located.</text>

            <text syncTime="1141.712" offset="4714335">It's a... it's a significant problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.030" offset="4719560">One of the things that we've pointed out in our moving... in... in our merits brief was that this is a housing authority that has approximately 8,000 individuals who are scattered in 3,308 low income to moderate income housing units.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.566" offset="4773685">From 1998 until November of this past year, there were 700 felony arrests for drug-related criminal activity in or near Oakland Housing Authority property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.294" offset="4820601">Significantly, between January 1, 2001 and November 6, 2001, the number of felony arrests was 250 for drug-related activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.675" offset="4858113">That's a significant sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.174" offset="4864173">One of the things that I think is also significant is that this is a housing authority that does not necessarily have large housing development complexes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.108" offset="4899909">A number of its developments are smaller units.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.796" offset="4910671">For example, in the Hill and Lee cases, those are individuals who resided in... in a development that is approximately eight units, eight units in a neighborhood that is comprised almost exclusively of single family dwellings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.932" offset="4971171">When these individuals participate in this drug activity in the front of that unit, it is not only affecting the members of the housing authority community itself, it is affecting the general community at large and all the individuals there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.230" offset="5028327">And significantly we need to point out that we responded there not because we happened to be driving by, but the response was... was premised on a complaint being made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1253.121" offset="5159984">In... it seems to me... to me that there is no issue that in each one of these particular cases there was just cause for the housing authority to go forward and... and to exercise this discretion reasonably and that it did so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1306.081" offset="5371785">Realizing that, the agency at that point discontinued its efforts to dismiss that... to terminate that lease.</text>

            <text syncTime="3408.667" offset="13782168">I'd first like to add that the... the people... the people who had committed the drug offenses in this case were between ages 20 and 44 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.339" offset="13824800">They weren't teenagers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.240" offset="13828457">The question of... as to the relationship of... of Federal law and the... the Federal law that waives... that permits HUD to waive the grievance procedure in the housing authority and say you can just go to the eviction court... and that law does provide that HUD has to... it can only permit that if it can ensure... assure that the eviction court gives you full due process rights to litigate whatever issues there are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.099" offset="13927827">And in that sense, Federal law does guarantee you the right to have all of your defenses litigated in the eviction proceeding if HUD is going to grant such a waiver, which it's done in 47 States.</text>

            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="3456.997" offset="13975475">Yes, but what Federal law doesn't do is say that there's any particular defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.027" offset="13995537">As the question of what the defenses are that you have to have the full right to litigate, that's a question of... of substantive Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.773" offset="14022495">Now, in this case, the statute makes clear I think that serious... that drug-related criminal activity is cause for termination of tenancy, and HUD has construed it to mean that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.181" offset="14060216">Now, the question then about... the only possible source for a defense would be State law, and the question about for State law defense would be does that conflict with either the Federal statute or the purposes Congress was trying to achieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.397" offset="14105042">It wouldn't be possible for a State court to disagree with the balance that Congress struck when it... when it passed the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.099" offset="14135866">So, the only question would be, therefore, if you have any State law defenses, they would have to be ones that don't conflict with the judgment that Congress made that eviction under 1437d(l)(6) is for serious... it's for drug... drug-related criminal activity by a household member.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.363" offset="14196888">I'd like to add just one other point which is in 42 U.S.C., section 1437, which is kind of the statement of policy right at the beginning of the United States Housing Act, it says, it is the policy of the United States... and it names a bunch of things, which I'm not going to read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.145" offset="14268046">And it says, to vest in local public housing agencies the maximum amount of responsibility in the administration of their housing programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.270" offset="14296572">It was those local public housing agencies that know what the conditions are, and that... it is consistent with that that HUD has construed the statute and Congress in fact enacted the statute to give them the discretion with this clause, as with enforcement of rent clauses or any other clause, to decide when they should be enforced and when they should be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.843" offset="14366789">That's not a role for the eviction court.</text>
