            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87457">The opinion of the Court in No. 99-1823 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission versus Waffle House will be announced by Justice Stevens.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="10.262" offset="128417">This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.609" offset="145867">It presents a question whether an arbitration agreement between an employer and an employee prevents the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from pursuing victim-specific relief, in other words, reinstatement backpay and damages in an enforcement action brought in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.792" offset="222562">When Eric Baker applied for a job as a grill operator in one of the Waffle House Restaurants, he signed an agreement that “any dispute or claim” concerning his employment would be settled by binding arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.532" offset="281495">After he started working, Baker suffered a seizure and soon thereafter was discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.508" offset="305423">He did not initiate arbitration proceedings nor has he done so in the seven years since his termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.633" offset="333948">Baker did however file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.575" offset="353697">After an investigation and an unsuccessful attempt to conciliate, the EEOC filed suit against respondent in Federal District Court seeking an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.387" offset="396956">Bakers’ reinstatement with backpay and damages for violations of Americans with Disabilities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.321" offset="428721">Respondent then field a petition under the Federal Arbitration Act seeking the stay the EEOC sued and to compel arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.637" offset="461948">The District Court denied the petition, but on appeal, the Court of Appeals applying a balancing test held that the EEOC was precluded from seeking victim-specific relief because the federal policy favoring arbitration outweighs the EEOC’s interest in vindicating Baker’s private interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.383" offset="540943">Injunctive relief would still be avaiable under the Court of Appeals’ rule because in that context the EEOC is protecting the interest of employees generally, but all other relief would be barred in order to give full effect to the arbitration agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.871" offset="602905">We granted certiorari and now reverse and remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.631" offset="617952">The Court of Appeals policy judgment might be persuasive if it were true that the EEOC could prosecute its frame only with Baker’s consent or if Baker dictated the EEOC’s prayer for relief, but the exact opposite is true under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.638" offset="685975">After the Commission filed suit, the employee has no independent course of action, although, he may intervene in the EEOC’s suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.056" offset="719620">The statute expressly authorizes the EEOC to seek an injunction, reinstatement with or without backpay and compensatory and punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.804" offset="762670">Not a word in the statutory provision was giving the EEOC litigating authority, or in any of our cases suggest that the mere existence of an arbitration agreement between private parties qualifies that authority, nor does the Federal Arbitration Act, which of course was enacted long before the EEOC was created, impose any limits on the EEOC’s authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.803" offset="862667">That statute was intended to place arbitration agreements on the same footing as other contracts, not to extend them beyond their term.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.813" offset="898611">Although we have held that the FAA manifest a liberal policy favoring arbitration, we have also held that it is the language of the arbitration agreement that defines the scope of the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.779" offset="950543">The Act does not authorize a court to compel arbitration of any issues or by any parties not covered in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.109" offset="979800">The EEOC of course was not a party to the agreement between Baker and Waffle House.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.511" offset="1001429">In sum, this is a case in which a straightforward reading of the unambiguous text of the relevant statutes supports the position of the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.603" offset="1037792">Justice Thomas joined by the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
