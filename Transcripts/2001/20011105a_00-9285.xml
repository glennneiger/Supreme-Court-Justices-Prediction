            <text syncTime="57.979" offset="385636">This case presents this Court with the extraordinary circumstances of a judge appointing a lawyer to a death penalty case when that judge knew or reasonably should have known that the lawyer represented the victim at the time of the victim's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.558" offset="439971">As a consequence, Walter Mickens has been deprived his constitutional rights under the Sixth Amendment to conflict-free representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.931" offset="13557411">The thrust of the respondent's argument here is that Holloway stands for the proposition that if a defense attorney raises an objection to the court and the court compels that representation over that objection, then that is where the prejudice is presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.976" offset="13625642">If you take this argument to its logical conclusion, then anytime a defense attorney raises an objection on the basis of a conflict to a court and the court compels that representation over that objection, then prejudice should be presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.544" offset="13687918">In other words, when you have a situation where a defense attorney raises an objection to the court, the court properly inquires of that defense attorney about that conflict and properly finds that there is no debilitating conflict here and then requires that... that defense attorney to proceed with the representation, then under what the respondents say here, prejudice should be presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.912" offset="13777362">That's not what Holloway stands for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.944" offset="13785512">Holloway stands for the proposition that the trial court has the duty of protecting the essential rights of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.133" offset="13814246">The trial court has the duty of seeing that the Sixth Amendment rights of a defendant are protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.824" offset="13837025">And in this case, the trial court failed in that responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.797" offset="13852908">It knew or should have known of that conflict, failed to inquire into that conflict and that's where the prejudice lies here.</text>
