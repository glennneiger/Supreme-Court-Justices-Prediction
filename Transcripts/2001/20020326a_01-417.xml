            <text syncTime="16.140" offset="210504">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: This is a case about the right to take an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.406" offset="239657">Over Petitioner's objections, the district court confirmed a class action settlement that substantially reduces Petitioner's individual pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.860" offset="277378">The Fourth Circuit held that Petitioner nonetheless may not appeal to argue that the district court abused its discretion in rejecting his objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.891" offset="317502">Our principal submission is that, as Justice Kennedy explained in oral argument in the Felzen case, Rule 23 class members such as Petitioner are bound by the district court's judgment and thus are parties to that judgment with the right to appeal from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.238" offset="382912">Because the Government, although seated at the opposite side of the table, actually agrees with us that class members are bound by the judgment, that objector appeals identify important legal errors, and that they also deter collusive settlements, I will leave to the Solicitor General's representative any arguments to the contrary that my friend Mr. Gold may make.</text>

            <text syncTime="87.390" offset="495552">I mean, there are cases where someone who has allied with a party and has used the same attorney and has maybe had some input into trial strategy, that that person will be bound by the judgment, but as far as I know, we have never allowed, no court that I know of has ever allowed such a person to take an appeal on the ground that well, since you would have been bound, you are a party.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="115.049" offset="606207">Justice Scalia, I think it depends on what we mean by bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.515" offset="620000">There are different, more expansive notions of collateral estoppel and res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.684" offset="636718">What I'm talking about here is that the judgment operates directly upon the class member.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.812" offset="661273">And let me be clear that our position is not to move beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.882" offset="677469">Our position is not that it's sufficient to be a party, but that it is a necessary condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.628" offset="696486">It is also necessary, and this is an important point for the distinction between appealing from an approved settlement and for appealing a litigated judgment.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="145.636" offset="728565">You say that the judgment operates directly upon the class member, as if we are talking about some sort of physical thing, but how is that operation on the class member different from, say, what might be res judicata or collateral estoppel in some other case?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="162.975" offset="797841">Mr. Chief Justice, the difference is that while you can have an application of collateral estoppel or res judicata that extinguishes a right to pursue an action, what I'm talking about here and let me put it in very practical terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.493" offset="843921">The Petitioner had a pension and that pension went down 40 percent when the district court in this case approved a settlement that said the COLA provisions of the pension plan are null and void, and that's the kind of direct operation I'm talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.641" offset="904525">Now, there is an unsettled area of the law stretching to precedents dating from the 1850s, the so-called quasi-party cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.700" offset="932738">We don't think it's necessary to apply those here because unlike a Rule 23.1 class member in the context of a derivative action, we are directly bound by the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.960" offset="981848">We are not talking about extinguishing a right of ours, for example, to sue on behalf of a corporation.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="214.904" offset="1005567">You are bound because a judge determined that you had an adequate representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.279" offset="1023121">I agree with you that every person in that class is equally affected and indeed there is no opt out of this class that we are dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.841" offset="1057394">But the determination has been made that you are represented by someone who is an adequate representative of all members of the class who will fairly and adequately represent the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.730" offset="1104937">So as long as the representative will fairly and adequately represent the class, why isn't it the end of it?</text>

            <text syncTime="246.483" offset="1131895">Well, that's a good entry into the purpose and function of Rule 23(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="251.769" offset="1153107">What happens is that at the point that it's acknowledged by the Respondents here that at the point settlement is agreed to, the class representative and be opposing named parties joined forces to oppose objections, and that continued at the stage of the case where you have to decide whether or not to take an appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="297.920" offset="1337636">A class action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to all members of the class in such manner as the court directs.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.013" offset="1386014">Now, let me detour for just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.176" offset="1394687">The Court will notice it noticed in the Felzen case that this rule doesn't actually explicitly provide for objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.270" offset="1419033">The advisory committee notes make clear that that was the intent of this provision, and in fact amended Rule 23(e) which will go into effect next year explicitly provides for the right to state objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.024" offset="1470129">To return to Justice Ginsburg's question, what happens is that this rule recognizes that the class representative is not speaking on behalf of the objectors at the point an objection is taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.367" offset="1519448">They in fact litigate actively for the settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.710" offset="1532823">Mr. Gold here is on behalf of the class representative in this case and goodness knows, he will argue that we have no right to take an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.762" offset="1565005">The rule, 23(e), provides an opportunity for us to come in, advise the district court of a problem with the settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.512" offset="1600010">Our point is that nothing in these rules contemplates that the objector's role would be extinguished at the district court, that someone uniquely in the context of a class action, who is bound directly by the judgment and participates as of right in the district court, would only participate at the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.553" offset="1724143">That is, if this is open under the language, it seems to me there is no real difference between the parties as a practical matter, except you want to say the person all the time, no matter what, can bring an appeal, and they want to say what you should do is intervene and that gives the district judge a chance to act in an unusual situation as a kind of safeguard to make sure that it is fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.288" offset="1827170">I mean, this person could be anybody under the sun.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.243" offset="1838978">It could muck up the litigation for everybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.504" offset="1852039">The extra time involved might be important, and it might be totally unfair, given the prior history, to allow this individual to bring the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.306" offset="1883177">So all they are saying is that the judge should have a chance as a gatekeeper to make that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.705" offset="1908777">Now why not, if it's open under the language, say there is a little more conservative position, gives us a chance to not get things mixed up?</text>

            <text syncTime="494.658" offset="2124653">This is the suggestion of the other side: requiring for the protection of the members of a class or otherwise for fair conduct of the action that notice be given.</text>

I'll just continue to read it: In such matters the court may direct to some or all members, of any step in the action or of the proposed extent of the judgment, or of... and this becomes critical... the opportunity of members to signify whether they consider the representation fair and adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.186" offset="2254743">And then the clause: to intervene and present claims or defenses or otherwise come into the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.644" offset="2272610">Our point is as follows, or is several fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.699" offset="2284731">The first is that this is a different notice from the 23(e) notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.581" offset="2300300">This is a discretionary notice that courts can employ in some cases, and I think it deserves to be emphasized that in the 35 years since 1966, not a single court has read this provision in the way that's suggested by the other side, that it's mandatory that there be an intervention for a screening function.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.330" offset="2371353">The particular reason is that this (d)(2) notice refers to intervening to present claims or defenses, and that the not what an objector seeks to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.702" offset="2408761">An objector says there is a settlement on the table, I have a legal objection to it, it's either unlawful, as in Amchem, or it's unfair as in this case, and so it's a different kind of intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.121" offset="2450452">So I don't think it's open and no court has ever suggested that it's how the rule should be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.678" offset="2472708">Now, assume the Court disagrees with me, Justice Breyer, why isn't it a good idea?</text>
            <text syncTime="586.257" offset="2490994">It doesn't accomplish anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.622" offset="2496427">What happens is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.941" offset="2501756">You move to intervene, the intervention motion is denied, so you appeal that, so you haven't really gained anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="1324.261" offset="5443040">In 2003, assuming the rules as proposed to be amended are actually implemented, there is going to be a real problem with the Respondent's suggestion and opt-outs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2789.617" offset="11304499">So what the intervention motion process allows is, we don't think a merits determination on the value of the objection, but we think it allows a district court in the first instance to make a record and address whether someone is a member of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.599" offset="11364372">I mean, you could have a class action that's not as discrete as this one here, but the definition of the class is everyone employed by X corporation for a period of 10 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3164.579" offset="12804346">Because, remember that motion was made before the settlement was even distributed and notice was given, so it would have been odd to grant intervention for a settlement judgment that had not yet been entered and the judge hadn't heard objections or had a fairness hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.468" offset="12851889">I mean district court can only say I'll reserve judgment and I will renew or revisit this question for limited purposes of appeal after I have judgment, if you are still interested, if your concerns are not addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.728" offset="12900894">In this case, the intervention was, again, before the settlement was even distributed to members of the class, and it was joined with a motion that asked to strike class counsel for preliminary injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3321.815" offset="13433270">If I could make four points, please, about the Government's proposal starting with its applications to this case, because Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg wanted to know whether we do here, assuming what happened in the district court, assuming we were going to adopt the Government's position, the Government does not press, so far as I understand, any further whether or not it's presented in this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.276" offset="13539118">We have the cert petition identifying the motion to intervene, the discussion of the Seventh Circuit's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.019" offset="13542044">The question is what we did in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.679" offset="13544656">The argument, as I understand it, the textual basis for the Government's rule is that under subsection (d)(2) of rule 23 you move to intervene, and the language of the rule is that the district court can condition your right to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.283" offset="13607141">And Justice Ginsburg, if you would adopt the Government's suggestion, I think that's what you would have to say was the appropriate result in this case, that the district judge should have seen our intervention motion and because he clearly did believe we had the right to take an appeal, he should have conditioned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.401" offset="13663565">So my principal point is that whatever the Court does in terms of its rule, we prevail.</text>

            <text syncTime="3467.739" offset="14016950">Our point is that no circuit applies the Government's rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.968" offset="14025832">It's a little unfair to say that I can't identify a problem with their rule, since no court has ever adopted or even suggested it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.922" offset="14053626">Now, it is a problem to the extent that there are circuits that require full party intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.683" offset="14076718">That you have to come in, you have to be a litigant in order to take an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.655" offset="14088630">The problem is not an administrative one so much as that it cuts off appeals, appeals that are perfectly legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.145" offset="14110573">The rule as we understand it under this Court's precedents is not that only named parties can take an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.537" offset="14140143">That's why someone who sanctions can appeal and that's why it's uncontested that the denial of our motion to intervene gives us a right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.717" offset="14168878">It is persons who are directly affected by the judgment, directly bound by something that the district court did, and then what they can do is they can appeal to the extent that the arguments that they properly presented to the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.144" offset="14218511">Now, someday, will there be unusual class actions that require a further screen?</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.005" offset="14242021">Perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.953" offset="14245783">Our point is that in an appropriate case a district court could employ the Government's suggestion, but why we would want to add the burden of this intervention requirement in every single class action in order to avoid the hypothetical possibility, that again has never been suggested by any court, State or Federal, so far as we or the Government have been able to identify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.130" offset="14330524">The other point I would like to make, just to, although again we believe we prevail under the Government's suggestion, is to take you back to the text that's supposed to require this intervention, and I think a fair reading of the text is otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.299" offset="14383187">There are two different provisions for notice that we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.014" offset="14398024">The one is the D provision that I quoted midway through the argument, and the other is E, which is the settlement notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.671" offset="14420698">The point to recognize is that under (d)(2), which talks about intervening to present claims or defenses, there is no intervention requirement when it comes to presenting objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.674" offset="14472630">And we are not intervening to present any claims or defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.337" offset="14491334">There is just no textual hook here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.634" offset="14496558">To the extent the Court did want to look at subsection D, with respect, we think it's the end of that clause that says intervene to present claims or defenses or otherwise to come into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.764" offset="14541071">There is nothing in the text of the rule, there is nothing in the advisory committee notes that indicates that anyone contemplated the intervention to appeal.</text>
