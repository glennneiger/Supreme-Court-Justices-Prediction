            <text syncTime="55.327" offset="351392">In fact, Congress adopted this Court's language when it passed the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996 and adopted the meaning of that term given to it by this Court in a line of cases, Preiser v. Rodriguez, the Bronson case, McCarthy v. Bronson, and Wilson v. Seiter, that very clearly include single episode and excessive force cases, which the Second Circuit Court of Appeals excluded in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.275" offset="507186">It interpreted the term, prison conditions, to exclude those kinds of single episode and excessive forces instances of misconduct by prison officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.276" offset="1383229">Justice Kennedy, Congress used that term because it was used by this Court to describe a category of the universe as set forth in Preiser and again in McCarthy v. Bronson, where the court faced a similar issue under the Magistrates Act, the nonconsensual referral of petitions to magistrates, and said that all of these cases, 1983 cases are, indeed, conditions of confinement cases, and Congress wanted to use that language and that meaning given by this term so as to avoid corollary or, as you put it quite well, satellite litigation that, in fact... in fact has been spawned in the Second Circuit by the Nussle case, and we see it, for example, in Royster v. United States, which is before this Court on cert, where excessive force is no longer even involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.310" offset="1611330">It's a particularized instance, as the court of appeals referred to it, of denial of the documents, legal documents that the prisoner claims he is entitled to receive, and courts then and now would have to decide what kinds of cases are excessive force, if they are mixed with other cases that may not be excessive force, if they seem to involve in some respect ongoing conditions--</text>

            <text syncTime="403.534" offset="1744241">A case comes to mind that we decided earlier this term, a case called Molesco, which came from the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.702" offset="1768900">It didn't come here under the Prison Litigation Act, but what happened there was that the prisoner had a heart condition, he ordinarily was allowed to use the elevator to go up to the sixth floor cell, this day the prison attendant said no, you can't use the elevator, so he walked up the stairs and had a heart attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.595" offset="1848522">Now, that case was brought under the Eighth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="508.070" offset="2162409">There is a requirement for an informal contact or request.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.006" offset="2182158">In the Connecticut system, the commissioner entertains, personally reads, is on the floor and, indeed, there is the requirement that the lieutenant make two rounds every day, that a captain make one round, that he be or she be accessible in those circumstances, and that protection be provided, and that is, as a matter of fact, one of the advantages of exhausting, because it assures timely, prompt attention.</text>

Britton, which is cited in the briefs at 523 U.S. 574, and particularly at 585 the Court draws the distinction, because in Crawford-El it is saying that a heightened standard of intent need not be shown, should not be required in order to protect prison officials from frivolous lawsuits or from discovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="861.227" offset="3575007">It is a distinction that the Court draws so as to in effect provide reassurance that the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act will do the job of eliminating frivolous litigation as, indeed, it did in 1997a(c), where it provided for dismissal of actions that are frivolous, malicious, or seek monetary damage from an official who is immune, and it uses the term, prison conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="961.851" offset="3977501">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For four reasons, actions that challenge particular instances of unlawful conduct such as excessive force are actions with respect to prison conditions that must be exhausted under the PLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.113" offset="4070602">First, in three cases, this Court has used the terms, prison conditions, or conditions of confinement, to refer to particular instances of unlawful conduct and, in one of those cases, McCrary v. Bronson, it applied the term to a single episode of excessive force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.270" offset="4147193">There's no reason to think that Congress intended any narrower meaning here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.269" offset="4167255">Second, the purposes of the exhaustion provision are to give prison officials an opportunity to resolve problems within the prison by themselves, and to reduce the enormous volume of prison litigation in Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.696" offset="4228904">In terms of those two purposes, there's absolutely no reason to distinguish between actions that challenge particular instances of unlawful conduct such as excessive force and any other sort of prisoner complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.523" offset="4288254">Prison authorities in fact have a particularly strong interest in resolving complaints about staff misconduct on their own, and grievance procedures are fully effective to do that without any need for significant Federal court litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.672" offset="4360874">Third, as this Court has recognized, it is extremely difficult to administer a line between isolated episodes or particular instances and more systematic practices, or actions undertaken pursuant to a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.499" offset="4424091">Any effort to do that would generate substantial additional litigation on a threshold collateral issue when Congress' goal was to reduce the amount of judicial resources devoted to prisoner complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.918" offset="4485844">And finally, creating an exception for particular instances of unlawful conduct has the potential to create an enormous loophole in the exhaustion requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.065" offset="4538403">Already, that exception has been applied by the Second Circuit to retaliation claims, to confiscation of property claims, and it has the potential and capability to be applied to a wide variety of prisoner complaints that are directed at the actions of individual officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.653" offset="4612799">It is very unlikely that the Congress amended this exhaustion provision for the express purpose of making sure that a dramatically increased number of cases would have to go through the exhaustion process, would have simultaneously cut out that large category of claims that could benefit from the exhaustion process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1193.214" offset="4902967">The Court said that the purpose of that act was to reduce the workload of Federal courts, and that would further that purpose, and it said that trying to draw that distinction between individual actions and systematic practices would provoke... generate a whole new round of litigation, when what we're trying to deal with here is something that's trying to save time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1240.688" offset="5092930">The context we have here is an exhaustion provision, and the purposes of exhaustion, as I have said, are to give prison officials a chance to act first to solve a problem and to reduce the volume of litigation and, in light of those purposes, it simply makes no sense to adopt a narrower meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1299.368" offset="5327614">One is that the line that was actually drawn in Hudson as I read it is not between single instances and systematic practices, it's between excessive force claims and everything else, which is... does still have its difficulties in administration, but maybe not quite as challenging as single instances versus systematic practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.861" offset="5413609">The other difference is, we're talking about applying something at the liability stage to make a determination on whether there has been liability enough, as opposed to, what do we do right at the outset of litigation when somebody comes in with a complaint, it's a threshold question, and generating additional litigation about that on a threshold question on a collateral issue it seems to me is something that you would want to generate less litigation about, generally speaking.</text>

            <text syncTime="2424.257" offset="9827154">The guards' union is a pretty powerful force and, indeed, in this case that was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.657" offset="9844812">There were the references to the fact that the guards' union was involved in a big dispute with the Governor of Connecticut, who happened to be a friend of Mr. Nussle, so that that was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.026" offset="9890265">The attempt by the State to take the title 18 definition and move it over to title 42 I think is equally unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.606" offset="9964558">The fact that it's in a different part of the code is one reason why Congress certainly wouldn't have attempted to adopt it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.342" offset="9987545">Indeed, it's in a part of the code, title 18, that deals with different issues from those which Congress was dealing with in its title 42 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.935" offset="10017847">Most importantly, of course, it is explicitly limited by its terms to section 802, that is, title 18, and is not applicable elsewhere and, as this Court held in the Vermont Agency of National Resources case, that at least suggests that it is inapplicable to title 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.276" offset="10099245">Also of great interest, and I think not addressed in the briefs, is that section 803 has its own definition section, just as section 802 does, but in the section 803 definition the term, prison conditions, or conditions of confinement, is not defined, but interestingly, in section 802 and in section 803 there is a definition of the word, prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.625" offset="10192659">The words aren't precisely the same, but the words appear to have the same meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.393" offset="10211676">Now, why would Congress find it necessary to define prisoner in section 803 when they'd already done so in 802, unless it was because they took seriously the limitation in 802, that the definitions there were limited to section 802?</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.579" offset="10268414">So I think that the attempt by the petitioners to borrow the section 802 language and incorporate that into section 803 simply won't work, and what we are left to fall back on is the statutory construction arguments which I have previously made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2575.225" offset="10431000">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I am not completely out of ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.609" offset="10456600">A few brief ones: First, to expand, perhaps, on the point raised by Justice Breyer, I can't speak for all the State prison systems throughout the United States, but a prison guard who did what Mr. Nussle claimed he or they did would be transferred, disciplined, perhaps fired by this commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.712" offset="10564956">I am certain of that fact, because we have assisted in that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.168" offset="10586794">Indeed, some of those guards have been criminally investigated, not guards involving this incident, but some who have committed the kinds of acts that Mr. Nussle might complain of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.129" offset="10630680">There are speedy, effective administrative remedies that can be applied to protect prisoners, and it is in the interests, may I respectfully suggest, of the State to do so to eliminate or at least reduce prison unrest, to make sure that it isn't held liable in more serious incidents, if they are bad guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.344" offset="10727542">The administrators of modern prison systems have a very powerful and compelling self-interest in using the grievance system as a management tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.081" offset="10770487">Now, that may not have been on Congress' mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.568" offset="10784385">Congress undoubtedly was concerned, as the legislative history clearly shows, with the fact that there were 40,000 of these lawsuits pending, prisoner petitions, constituting one-quarter of the entire Federal case load.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.611" offset="10840600">Congress wanted to streamline the system and force all of these prison petitions to go through the exhaustion process, and there is no evidence, absolutely no evidence in the legislative history or elsewhere it intended to carve out or make an exception for single incident excessive force cases and, indeed, the evidence is all to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.266" offset="10951150">McCarthy v. Bronson was a single incident, single episode of excessive force, but this Court said that it was included in the term, conditions of confinement, for purposes of the Magistrate Referral Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.150" offset="11022726">That is the term that Congress understood it to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.029" offset="11038295">Crawford-El confirms at 597, where I quoted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.829" offset="11061491">It's in our view conclusive on this point, but we would submit that the interests of the statute are best served, Congress' purposes are best served.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.207" offset="11110915">The distinction that is suggested by the respondents is unsupported in principle and unworkable in practice for many of the same reasons that this Court said in Wilson v. Seiter that the single incident versus continuing practice distinction was simply illogical and impractical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.901" offset="11197746">If the Court has no further questions, I have nothing further.</text>
