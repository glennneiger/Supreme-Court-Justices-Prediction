            <text syncTime="9.035" offset="184402">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court: In 1996 Congress updated the child pornography laws to keep pace with technological developments.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.693" offset="231109">Congress extended the existing prohibitions on visual depictions of actual children engaged in sexually explicit conduct to cover virtually indistinguishable images in material pandered as child pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.744" offset="287324">These provisions are constitutional for the same basic reason that other laws prohibiting child pornography have been upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.945" offset="316059">They protect real children from real abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.041" offset="328493">They do so in two important ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.856" offset="339674">First, by preventing the publication and production of materials that are as effective as traditional child pornography in seducing children, and second, by allowing the government to effectively prosecute cases involving traditional forms of child pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.917" offset="411981">First, these provisions allow the government to attack material that poses the same risk of enticing children into illicit sexual activities and to pose for child pornography as traditional child pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.505" offset="474361">The government has a clear and compelling interest in targeting such material; indeed, this court in Osborne against Ohio used that rationale to uphold Ohio's prohibition on the possession of child pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.956" offset="528173">Second and equally important, the government has a clear interest in promoting the effective prosecution of the traditional laws against traditional forms of child pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.159" offset="576970">The advent and increasing availability of computer technology has allowed individuals to generate computer images that are virtually indistinguishable from traditional photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.681" offset="623050">This allows criminal defendants to inject reasonable doubt arguments into virtually every case.</text>

            <text syncTime="125.234" offset="649277">Has any case, to your knowledge, been lost on that ground in which that was a substantial argument?</text>

            <text syncTime="132.443" offset="678116">No case has been lost on that ground but that is largely a result of the 1996 Act, which has taken that argument away from criminal defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.980" offset="716255">And to give you one very specific example, the case that the Fifth Circuit heard in the Fox case, United States against Fox which is one of the cases where the lower courts upheld this law in an as applied context, the government's expert witness, Special Agent Barkhausen was forced on cross-examination to admit that she could not tell definitively whether or not the image was of a real child.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.539" offset="806430">Now that concession prior to the 1996 Act would likely have been fatal to the government's prosecution.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="170.995" offset="832239">Was that because she couldn't tell whether the real child was over 18 or under 18 or because she couldn't tell whether it was a real person?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="185.795" offset="891484">In the cases where the line that the courts are concerned with is the line between 18 and 19, there's an additional aspect of the statute that clears up many of the problems and that's the affirmative defense which allows individuals to produce and distribute materials if they make clear they involve actual individuals who are over 18.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="205.968" offset="972151">But in terms of what you outlined, in terms of the two dangers, you say just the same as if it were an actual child.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.441" offset="1006110">Well, if it's a very young adult who looks like a child, it seems to me everything that you said about the virtual pornography would apply to a young adult who looks like a child.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="228.508" offset="1062325">That's certainly true, but I think Congress in recognizing an affirmative defense for materials that were produced using people who had reached the age of majority struck a balance and recognized that this Court has provided additional protection to pornographic depictions involving actual adults.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="247.217" stopTime="251.217">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="247.217" offset="1137140">Okay, well the question of the balance raises the question of tailoring, and what I wanted to ask you was if it's appropriate to have the affirmative defense that the children or that the people depicted were in fact over 18, why isn't it equally appropriate to have an affirmative defense to the effect that the depiction does not have anyone who is not a real child under 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.378" offset="1257826">In other words, if the government's interests are protected by the affirmative defense in the real child case, why shouldn't there be a comparable affirmative defense for the simulation.</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="287.732" stopTime="291.732">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="287.732" offset="1299204">I think there are at least two reasons for that differential treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.755" offset="1311324">One is with respect to age that's a fact that's uniquely verifiable and in a lot of contexts we recognize that somebody's age is something that one can verify.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.244" offset="1345284">And in fact what we're really talking about in most of these cases where the affirmative defense for age would be implicated are films and the like where there would be witnesses who could testify that somebody was of a particular age on a particular date.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="312.375" offset="1397842">But in effect you're depending on the witness to say that the actors here were in fact over 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.143" offset="1424905">Maybe they'll produce facsimiles of birth certificates or maybe they'll produce children or whatnot.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.839" offset="1443609">Why can't you have the same evidence to the effect that there were no real children being used in manufacturing the film?</text>
            <text syncTime="331.663" offset="1474955">You're depending on witnesses in each case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="333.694" offset="1483106">Well, in most of the cases when you're talking about somebody who's going to make the claim that they actually generated the photographs themselves, there will be no witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.991" offset="1516229">But I think more important than the presence or absence of witnesses is--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="346.223" offset="1533156">But that's a question of proof and I suppose that if the only person who steps up to the stand and says, there were no live children here, is the person who was accused of the pornography, that person may have something to worry about in not having a very convincing affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.771" offset="1603373">But that's the defendant's problem, not the government's problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.746" offset="1615285">And so I don't think that answers the question, why if the government is sufficiently protected with the affirmative defense in the one class of cases it wouldn't be in the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.852" offset="1655723">--And I do think that age rather than whether an image is computerally generated is something that is uniquely subject to verification and this Court in its Ferber decision confronted the argument that the New York statute was overbroad because it didn't limit its protections to photographs and images that were produced in the state of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.824" offset="1727612">And the court rejected that overbreadth argument for two reasons; one, that it would be virtually impossible for anybody to prove what was the state of origin for the photo.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.394" offset="1765855">And I think the same analysis applies for a computer generated image.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.425" offset="1777976">The second reason, of course, was that even materials--</text>

            <text syncTime="410.392" offset="1789888">Why is it... why is it that witnesses can explain the age but cannot explain whether it was computer generated?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="416.704" offset="1815070">--Because, again, in sort of the stylized case that the person who's computer generated an image, that's not something that requires a film crew to be brought in so there aren't necessarily going to be witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.754" offset="1863344">In the case--</text>

            <text syncTime="431.519" offset="1874420">I mean, that may be the problem of the person who has the burden of proof to carry on the affirmative defense and if it is a problem then the government is the... in effect going to be the winning party in resolving that problem, but like Justice Stevens, I don't see what is essentially unique in the probative process to acclaim that it was a computer generation rather than a claim that the kid shown was over 18.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.262" offset="2009316">And if I could get to the second reason that this Court pointed out in Ferber why you didn't need to have a limitation just to pictures generated in the State of New York, the Court recognized in footnote 19 that those materials, even if produced outside the State of New York, pose harms and potential risk to children inside the State of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="3444.845" offset="13927631">Well, that reflects a couple of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.747" offset="13935259">One, it reflects that the 1996 Act has allowed us to prosecute cases even where there is a reasonable doubt about whether it is a virtual image or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.884" offset="13971831">The other thing that the 97 percent conviction rate reflects is that we are not out there prosecuting people who pick up Traffic at the Blockbuster.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.749" offset="14003282">It's no accident that the one court that considered this case in a facial challenge struck the statute down, but the four courts of appeals that considered it in an as applied challenge upheld the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.679" offset="14051034">Those cases give you an illustration of what the statute is really applied to.</text>
