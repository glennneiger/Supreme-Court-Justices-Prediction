            <text syncTime="214.000" offset="1011951">That would be a determination for the Federal district court to make in the event that the State instrumentality raised an Eleventh Amendment immunity defense to the attempted enforcement action by the private complainant.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.171" offset="1204631">That's what... the Eleventh Amendment is just a reflection of the fact that they retained that sort of sovereign immunity, and I don't think it makes any difference that, you know, if the King of England summons George Washington, President of the United States, to appear before a parliamentary commission or some royal tribunal instead of an English court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1622.969" offset="6647818">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents the question of whether sovereign immunity protects a State from a private suit brought before a Federal administrative tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.091" offset="6704242">We have heard today arguments and suggestions that this proceeding is not a suit within the meaning of the doctrine and principle of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.275" offset="6741022">In 1868, this Court addressed this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.587" offset="6754293">It held in Nichols v. United States that a proceeding before an Article I administrative tribunal, a so-called legislative court, just like the Federal Maritime Commission, was a suit for sovereign immunity purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.273" offset="6793058">The case was appealed from an appeals court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.054" offset="6808105">The Court confirmed that legislative court status of the claims court twice, in Ex parte Bakelite in 1929, and then in Williams v. United States in 1933, and later in 1934 the court again, in United States v. Sherwood, unanimously confirmed both conclusions, that States... that claims court was an Article I legislative court, and its jurisdiction was dependent upon a waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.902" offset="6915520">There were no dissenting justices in any single one of those decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.553" offset="6950107">Here we're being told that the Maritime Commission is in the business of making rules for the governance of people in the trade, and it makes the rules three ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.435" offset="6989708">One through rule-making, another's through commission proceeding, and a third through private complaints, and why couldn't the private complainant be regarded as a kind of delegate to the commission?</text>

            <text syncTime="1830.857" offset="7479347">If a private party came into the commission and said, we have this grievance against the South Carolina State Port Authority and we'd like you to look into it, and the Bureau of Enforcement came to us and said, we think you're doing something wrong, we would obviously talk to them, and if we couldn't reach some kind of accommodation with respect to that matter, then we would... and they brought a complaint against us, they would be entitled to do that if... provided the complaint was brought in their names and formed by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.705" offset="7586763">And I might add that, in a reparations proceeding... this is not a sanctionless exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.590" offset="7614244">In a reparations proceeding, if the agency issues an order against us, a judgment against us, and we fail to comply with that judgment, we incur statutory liabilities, automatic, of up to $25,000 a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.713" offset="7670773">Now, they can be compromised by the agency for a period of 5 years after each violation, if it so chooses, but any time somebody says to me, for example, that if you don't do XYZ you're going to incur an automatic statutory liability of $25,000 a day, I consider that a sanction, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="3413.573" offset="13810175">If I could keep going with your inquiry, Justice Breyer, I think we are suggesting that there is a line in this case, and that line is Freytag v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.688" offset="13854688">We're not suggesting that State instrumentalities would never have sovereign immunity in administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.941" offset="13883631">Rather, we're suggesting that they might in proceedings in which contempt power can be exercised, and this is not one such proceeding because the agency doesn't have coercive authority over the entities that it regulates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.213" offset="13932742">It has to rely on a Federal district court for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.757" offset="13942982">To make another point, I think Mr. Dean emphasized that the Shipping Act allows the agency to fine instrumentalities that don't comply with its order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.339" offset="13993241">However, I should point out that in this case the commission has never indicated that it has the authority to fine a State instrumentality for not complying with a reparation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.725" offset="14030858">That was something that ended up in the Fourth Circuit's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.437" offset="14045695">We've never said we could do it, and the United States in its reply brief to this Court has specifically expressed the view that the FMC could not fine a State-run court for not complying with the agency-issued reparation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.600" offset="14098358">And finally, with respect to the issue of whether and when the agency's Bureau of Enforcement can intervene in an agency proceeding, I should point out that whether or not the Bureau of Enforcement intervenes in the adjudication does not get to the point of whether it is an agency action, because the agency always retains the ability to review, sua sponte, any administrative law judge order that comes out.</text>

            <text syncTime="3513.376" offset="14209431">I think the United States has suggested that because the commission and the Attorney General don't have the authority to enforce a reparation order against a State, that the authority to fine the State for not complying with that reparation order would not be an appropriate interpretation of the Shipping Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.440" offset="14281633">Again, that's something, the commission has never said that it has the authority to, or that it would fine a State for not complying with an agency-issued reparation order.</text>

            <text syncTime="3548.896" offset="14351537">I'm unsure of that, Justice Ginsburg, but we would suggest that the pleading requirements of Ex parte Young need not be imported into the Shipping Act, and that a request for, for example, a cease and desist order against the ports authority would, under the Shipping Act, be sufficient, and that the complaint need not name the commissioners of the ports authority themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="3576.315" offset="14461147">I think what Justice Ginsburg's question went to, you're saying you don't have to name the individuals, but suppose that we held that you couldn't name the State, do you think you have authority to name the individuals?</text>

            <text syncTime="3590.075" offset="14516213">The Shipping Act provides that complaints must be filed against persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.118" offset="14532409">I think the question would be rather whether the port commissioners are persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.067" offset="14552157">It may be that a fiction could be conceived that they would be under the Shipping Act, but again, that issue has never come up in the commission's administration of the statute.</text>
