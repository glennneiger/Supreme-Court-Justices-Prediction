            <label>Mr. Jeffrey S. Sutton</label>
            <text syncTime="10.197" offset="197998">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.707" offset="212000">May it please the Court: The question presented in this case is whether Congress in 1994 divested the States of their traditional authority to delegate police powers over local safety matters to their political subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.567" offset="271454">It would be no small matter for Congress to impose such a restriction on the States, and we submit they did no such thing in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.196" offset="305936">In making that point, it may be helpful to look at the text of the statute, which is reprinted in full in the appendix to our brief, the blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.113" offset="341671">And page A-2 of that appendix specifically repeats the language of (c)(2)(A), the operative provision at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.688" offset="379915">And our first point, as a matter of the language of the statute, is that Congress specifically said that the preemption provision, quote, "shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State."</text>
            <text syncTime="70.920" offset="440832">Now, prior to 1994, Ohio, the State of Ohio, had exercised regulatory authority in this area by delegating its power specifically over tow truck regulations to local political subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.346" offset="490569">It's very difficult for us to understand how the court of appeals interpretation does not in fact, quote, "restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State."</text>
            <text syncTime="96.638" offset="543755">That's--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="98.579" offset="551487">Well, I think the argument on the other side, Mr. Sutton, is that the first section (a)(1) does say, no State or political subdivision thereof and no interstate agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.329" offset="586491">It talks about a political subdivision so that when you come down to the section you've just quoted, and it only says State, there's perhaps a fair inference that only a State and not a political subdivision is included.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey S. Sutton</label>
            <text syncTime="119.961" offset="637064">--Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.870" offset="640721">And the normal Russello argument is that a litigant like myself is trying to read into another provision a term that is specifically mentioned elsewhere in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.561" offset="683458">Here the suggestion is that we're trying to read the term, political subdivision, into (c)(2)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="137.051" offset="705400">That's not what we're trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.620" offset="711670">What we're saying is the traditional safety regulatory authority of a State was preserved by (c)(2)(A) and traditionally States, including Ohio, had specifically exercised that authority by delegating it in some instances to State executive branch agencies and in other instances, specifically here, to political subdivisions.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="159.713" offset="796098">Would your argument be the same if the State had not made a specific delegation?</text>
            <text syncTime="164.793" offset="816369">Did it make a specific delegation with respect to tow trucks?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey S. Sutton</label>
            <text syncTime="166.938" offset="824937">Actually it did, although it's... it's backwards, in the sense that they generally regulate all motor carriers at the State level, but they exempted tow trucks, therefore allowing political subdivisions like Columbus to enact their own tow truck ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.983" offset="885123">So, in fact, in this case it would be specific, although I wouldn't say our argument rests on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.539" offset="907379">Many States like Ohio are home rule States, which in their constitutions give general grants to political subdivisions to have powers of local self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.948" offset="944996">So, in this case, I... I would say it's a little easier because there was something specific as to tow trucks, but I wouldn't say that our argument rests on that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.505" offset="1187203">Why in that provision does it say does not apply to a State or a political subdivision?</text>
            <text syncTime="263.739" offset="1212176">Because you're telling us, when you say State, it includes whatever authority the State has to delegate to a political subdivision.</text>

            <text syncTime="955.758" offset="3980215">This interpretation that the court of appeals embraced preempts that State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.337" offset="3998501">There's no... strictly speaking, there's no such thing as a city law divorced from a State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="983.145" offset="4089825">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The phrase, safety regulatory authority of a State, in section 14501(c)(2)(A) is most naturally read to encompass the State's traditional authority to delegate its powers to political subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.131" offset="4165685">That view is supported by the larger statutory context in which the phrase appears and by the purposes of the 1994 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.744" offset="4196196">As Mr. Sutton has explained and as this Court has frequently recognized, one integral component of the State's ability to regulate within its borders is to delegate as much or as little power as it wishes to subordinate political units.</text>

            <text syncTime="1028.031" offset="4269338">And... and in isolation, that phrase most naturally would... would mean safety regulatory authority of a State, including, of course, its ability to delegate it to municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.905" offset="4316777">But what is sticking in our craw is the fact that elsewhere in the statute, the language is very careful to distinguish between the authority of a State, on the one hand, and the... and the separate authority of political subdivisions of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1063.226" offset="4410086">The first is, as Mr. Sutton points out, this is not a case in which the other provisions are identical but for the inclusion of the word political subdivision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1084.624" offset="4495663">Now, even though delegating power to municipalities is an integral feature of the State's regulatory authority, it would certainly be less than clear that when a municipality enacted or enforced a law, pursuant to such delegation, it could not necessarily be said that the State had enacted or enforced that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.927" offset="4572881">And so, if the provision left out political subdivisions and simply said that the preemption rule does not apply to the authority of a State to enact or enforce a law, there would be ambiguity, and Congress... whether it was necessary or not, Congress might rationally choose to eliminate that potential ambiguity through an express reference to political subdivision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.875" offset="4648741">But the phrase that appears in subsection (2)(A) is simply safety regulatory authority of a State, and that, as you say, would most naturally be construed to encompass the authority to delegate power to municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.589" offset="4699523">The second point is that based on the country's traditions, it would certainly be an unusual thing for Congress to interfere with the States' decisions as to the amount of power that should be delegated to subordinate political units.</text>

            <text syncTime="1341.678" offset="5523947">It specifies these other matters, and as Mr. Sutton was pointing out, the other matters are covered in detail in different provisions of title 49.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.123" offset="5557698">In general, those other provisions of title 49 contain their own preemption provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.324" offset="5578491">They explain at... at great length what States can and can't do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.327" offset="5594478">At least in the area of safety, State law is specifically defined to include the law of the local governmental unit, and so the... the safety regime in the other parts of title 49 specifically contemplates municipal safety regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.907" offset="5648813">And it would be odd to think that Congress, in this oblique way, has superseded that carefully developed statutory framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.049" offset="5677443">And to put this in larger historical context, to follow up on Mr. Sutton's point, from 1966 to 1995, at the Federal level there was division of regulatory authority between the ICC which did economic regulation and the Department of Transportation which did safety regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.799" offset="5748391">And it's no coincidence that State law as to economic matters was preempted at about the same time that the ICC saw its powers diminished and the ICC was eventually eliminated altogether.</text>

            <text syncTime="1869.795" offset="7636418">And my impression is that in many cities there are many such streets, and which streets there are is a matter for the municipality to decide.</text>
