            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87686">The opinion of the court in No. 01-332, The Board of Education of Independent School District No.92 of Pottawatomie County versus Earls will be announced by Justice Thomas.</text>

            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="14.142" offset="144215">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.592" offset="170024">The Tecumseh School District enacted a Drug Testing Policy that requires all middle and high school student to consent to drug testing in order to participate in any extra curricular activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.920" offset="231359">Respondent high school students and their parents brought a Section 1983 action against the School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.038" offset="263751">Alleging that the policy violates the Fourth Amendment and that the School District failed to identify a special need for testing student who participate in extra curricular activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.764" offset="326654">Relying on our decision in Vernonia School District versus Acton, the District Court granted summary judgment to the School District and upheld the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.650" offset="374197">The Court of Appeals reversed and held that the policy violates the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.258" offset="396662">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.620" offset="410142">In Vernonia, we upheld the suspicion research drug testing of athletes.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.137" offset="436159">In doing so, we relied heavily on the fact that the policy tested children attending public schools and this such was undertaken in furtherance of the Government responsibilities as guardian and tutor of children entrusted to its care.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.556" offset="513900">We apply Vernonia’s principles to the somewhat different facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.814" offset="534902">First, the nature of the privacy interest allegedly compromised by the drug testing as minimum as students affected by the policy have a limited expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.547" offset="585789">Second, the invasion of the students’ privacy is not significant given the minimally intrusive nature of the sample collection and the limited uses to which the test results are put.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.656" offset="642213">The tests results are not turned over to any law enforcement authority, nor do the results lead to imposition of disciple or have any academic consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.512" offset="689652">Finally, considering the nature and immediacy of the Government's concerns and the efficacy of the policy in meeting them, we conclude that the policy effectively serves the School District's interest in protecting the safety and health of the students.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.789" offset="758824">Accordingly, we hold that the policy does not violate the Fourth Amendment because it is a reasonable means of furthering the School District's important interest in the determining  drug use among school children.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.323" offset="816920">Justice Breyer has filed the concurring opinion; Justice O’Conner has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Souter has joined, and Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens, O’Conner and Souter have joined.</text>
