            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87510">The opinion of the Court number 00-10666, Harris against United States will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="9.705" stopTime="217.652">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="9.705" offset="126276">As the Chief Justice indicates this is Harris versus United States, and in this case as in Ring versus Arizona, the opinion just announced today by Justice Ginsburg, we can consider a question arising from the Court's decision two years ago in Apprendi versus New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.312" offset="200672">The petitioner was convicted of violating a federal statute that prohibits defendants from using firearms during drug crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.249" offset="232437">The statute sets no maximum sentence, but the minimum sentence however depends on findings made by the sentencing judge, and the minimum increases from five to seven years, for example, when the judge finds that the defendant brandished the firearm, and that was the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.500" offset="305476">Petitioner was given the seven year minimum after the judge found that he brandished the firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.751" offset="330449">He argues that the statute is unconstitutional because brandishing should have been treated as an element of the crime and if that would so, it would had been found by the jury rather than the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.279" offset="376529">As the petitioner observes in federal prosecution, each element of the crime must be alleged in the indictment submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.259" offset="412473">In Apprendi, this Court held that any fact that increases the defendants’ sentence beyond the statutory maximum is an element.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.721" offset="442357">Petitioner argues that under the logic of Apprendi, any fact that increases the defendants’ minimum sentence should also be found by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.803" offset="478720">The Court rejected this argument in a 1986 case called McMillan versus Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.892" offset="503066">Petitioner says however that McMillan is inconsistent with Apprendi and must be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.556" offset="525636">The Court of Appeals upheld the statute and we now affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.353" offset="540891">Part four of my opinion which is the opinion for majority of the court holds that McMillan is still good law and that the statute is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.284" offset="576627">The majority agrees about this, our reasoning differs.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.200" offset="588225">Part three of my opinion is joined by three other justices, the Chief Justice, Justice O’Connor and Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.425" offset="617169">That portion of the opinion says that McMillan is consistent with the Apprendi and its logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.404" offset="637126">Read together McMillan and the Apprendi mean that the facts that authorize the judge to impose punishment are the elements of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.587" offset="665757">When as in the Apprendi, the facts found by the jury allow the judge to impose any sentence between zero and ten years, the judge has no authority to find a fact that extends the sentence beyond the ten years statutory maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.117" offset="715912">This sort of finding has traditionally been treated as an element and found by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.248" offset="736496">The facts that do not increase the defendant's sentence beyond the maximum are not elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.537" offset="753632">Judges have always had authority to find facts beyond that affect the defendant’s sentence within the statutory range.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.636" offset="786024">The facts like brandishing in this case, facts that when firearm require the judge to impose a mandatory minimum sentence below the maximum authorized by the jury's verdict are not elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.365" offset="828970">The judge could have imposed this sentence even he or she had not found the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.122" offset="847987">For these and other reasons we affirmed the court holding in McMillan.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.476" offset="861361">Facts increasing the defendant's minimum sentence but not extending it beyond the statutory maximum need not be alleged in the indictment submitted to the jury or proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.132" offset="900023">Justice O’Connor has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Breyer has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment; Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg joined.</text>
