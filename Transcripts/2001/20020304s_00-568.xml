            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87545">I have the opinion for the court to announce in No. 00-568, New York versus Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and 00-809 Enron Power Marketing versus the Federal Energy Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.518" offset="149612">The two cases were consolidated for argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.759" offset="162569">We granted certiorari to review a decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, upholding an order of the commission that primarily focused on the wholesale electricity market.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.816" offset="210738">Three aspects of the order are relevant to our review: first, FERC ordered functional unbundling of wholesale energy sales which means that utilities must state separate rates for energy transmission and other services provided, and must accept transmission of their own wholesale sales at the same rate that others are charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.368" offset="317005">The parties do not dispute the validity of this part of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.664" offset="334141">Second, FERC imposed a similar open access requirement on unbundled retail sales in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.478" offset="365383">New York challenges this part of the order in case No. 00-568.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.878" offset="387013">Third, FERC declined to extend the open access requirement to the transmission component of retail sales that remained bundled under state law concluding that unbundling such transmissions was unnecessary to remedy the discrimination in the wholesale market that FERC had found.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.685" offset="462245">Enron challenges this portion of the order in case No. 00-809.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.214" offset="484397">In an opinion authored by Justice Stevens, we reject both these challenges to FERC’s order and affirm the decision of the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.382" offset="521073">With respect to New York’s claim that FERC’s exercise of jurisdiction exceeded the bounds of the Federal Power Act, New York argues that retail electricity transactions are subject only to State regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.921" offset="575199">However, Section 201(b) of the Act gives FERC jurisdiction over their transmission of electric energy and interstate commerce, and the unbundled transmission that FERC has decided to regulate fall within the plain meaning of that section in light of the interconnected nature of the national grid for electricity nowadays.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.719" offset="662343">No statutory language limits FERC’s transmission jurisdiction to the wholesale market and in the absence of such language, New York’s argument that the statute draws a bright line between retail and wholesale transmission is unpersuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.639" offset="730053">With respect to Enron’s challenge to FERC’s decision not to regulate bundled retail transmissions, we conclude that FERC’s decision was a statutorally permissible one.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.169" offset="776133">FERC did not hold itself powerless to assert jurisdiction over bundled retail transmissions as Enron alleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.967" offset="807375">Instead it reasonably decided not to assert such jurisdiction in the present proceedings for two reasons:  first, it is said that such measures were unnecessary to remedy the discrimination in the wholesale market that it found; second, it is said that to do so would raise complicated jurisdictional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.776" offset="890549">The portions of our opinion discussing the New York case are unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.786" offset="906641">With respect to the Enron case, Justice Thomas joined by Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
