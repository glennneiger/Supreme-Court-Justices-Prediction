            <text syncTime="253.095" offset="1166497">Certainly the statute expressly states that in the case of an alleged, willful violation of the statute, which is what the plaintiff in this case alleged, you can get punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.240" offset="1199098">And the case law also allows for a plaintiff to seek injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.656" offset="1220727">Let me clarify what the injury is, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.232" offset="1235042">Maybe this will assist both you and Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.167" offset="1246850">What this statute does is... the credit reporting companies have computer databases that compile information about credit reporting histories of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.250" offset="1295124">And it makes that database available to subscribers, banks, insurance companies, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.211" offset="1326993">And a creditor can go onto that database, just like your law clerks can go on Westlaw, and pull off information.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.573" offset="1364401">And when they pull that information off, if there weren't reasonable procedures in place to prevent them from improperly pulling information off, that would be an improper disclosure, which would injure the person because it would invade their privacy and reveal confidential information about themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.289" offset="1423333">Under State law, they possibly would have a claim for invasion of privacy, or if there was inaccurate information in the database, for defamation of character.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.218" offset="1459069">What this statute did was it created a Federal right against improper disclosure in the absence of reasonable procedures of people's credit history.</text>

            <text syncTime="686.452" offset="2899983">It's in the nature of this statutory scheme and the subject matter that it's dealing with that the claims that this statute can give rise to become stale very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.529" offset="2944287">The reason is, is all of the information that's critical to presenting one of those claims is not in the hands of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.922" offset="2973857">It's either in our computer database or in the records of the creditors who in the crediting reporting agencies give the information to.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.459" offset="3003950">And that's why when Congress passed this statute, it said that there were going to be certain disclosures that it was going to require either the credit reporting agencies to make or the creditors to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.069" offset="3042402">But it also specified, because of concerns about the burdens of record keeping, quite finite periods of time by which those records would have to be kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.535" offset="3080332">So, at the time the statute was passed, a credit reporting agency only had to keep a list of who a disclosure was made to for 6 months, and now, as amended in 1996, they only have to keep it for a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.217" offset="3122964">And at the time the statute was passed, there was no requirement placed upon a subscriber to our database, one of the creditors, for any time period they had to keep their own records.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.483" offset="3164029">Now, in 1976, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act was passed, and the Federal Reserve Board promulgated regulations requiring that a creditor keep records of any action it takes to deny credit for up to 25 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.974" offset="3214079">But the fact of the matter is, because of... of the enormous amounts of information that are retained, the record retention policies of credit reporting agencies and creditors, pursuant to guidance received from the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Trade Commission... record retention... we... we get rid of those records at the end of 2 years as a credit reporting agency, and the banks get rid of them after 25 months.</text>

            <text syncTime="810.588" offset="3396518">So, what you have to know is, is who was the information disclosed to and when.</text>

            <text syncTime="819.692" offset="3432881">And under the statute, that list has to only be maintained for a year after 1996 by the credit reporting agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.941" offset="3461929">So, the only way to find out that a disclosure has been made is either within a year... or we actually keep it for 2 years because, in the case of an employment application, you have to keep it for 2 years, or from the creditor, and they only keep it for 25 months.</text>
