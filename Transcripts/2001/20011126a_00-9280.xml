I try these cases and... and negotiate plea bargains in these cases at the trial level, and I can tell you that there is nothing that cuts the ice faster with the victim's family, with the prosecutor in settling a case than life without parole not because of the dangerousness, but because of its retributive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.163" offset="2200158">And there's something terribly unfair at... when everyone in the courtroom knows how crushing this penalty is, this penalty of life without hope, except the jury, and they are left to think that their option is to let this man hope that some day he'll be out raising a family and working at a job and... and pretending to be a respectable member of the community when it isn't so.</text>

Ramos that it was for the States to decide whether to inform the juries on matters of parole or other early release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.986" offset="6515482">And the issue in this case is what argument and evidentiary submissions are sufficient to... for the prosecution to have been deemed to raise future dangerousness such that due process overcomes that State law rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.842" offset="6562920">And petitioner in this case contends that future dangerousness can be raised simply by the gruesome facts of the crime, by misbehavior in jail, by a prior criminal record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.690" offset="6606284">And, of course, that would create, as has already been discussed, a virtually standardless test and would conflict with this Court's statements of the Simmons rule, as well as the subsequent interpretation of the rule by many other courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.930" offset="6655289">And that is, of course, that a prosecutor must specifically rely on future dangerousness to society as a basis for death.</text>

            <text syncTime="3333.903" offset="13491116">Well, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.271" offset="13492684">The defense argued in this case just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.005" offset="13499580">They... they argued that a wife is never ever going to happen for Billy Kelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.397" offset="13513164">A car is never ever going to happen for Billy Kelly, and... and concluded by saying, I think life imprisonment is the right punishment in this case because he'll never see the daylight... the light of daylight again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.514" offset="13553601">So, I think it was clearly made to the jury, and there's no indication that there was confused... they were confused.</text>

            <text syncTime="3368.869" offset="13631028">The question has come up again concerning the history of South Carolina's handling of this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.485" offset="13661539">I should say that a very detailed accounting of the whole history, legislative and judicial, is provided in the cert petition in Simmons itself, and it's not a very edifying tale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.650" offset="13702186">It really shows that the legislature, when they first considered a limited life without parole, was deadlocked because of a fear that it would reduce the number of death sentences, and the legislative compromise that finally came out was we can go ahead and have life without parole because you don't have to tell the jury anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.418" offset="13761222">So, it won't have any effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3427.098" offset="13863936">If there was a connection, I don't know.</text>

            <text syncTime="3431.173" offset="13880236">The... my friend says that, well, South Carolina doesn't want the jury to know about commutation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3439.050" offset="13911792">There is no such thing as commutation of a life sentence under South Carolina law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3471.274" offset="14040628">And there... so, South Carolina's life without parole is as locked down as any State's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.626" offset="14066019">The idea that, well, there's lots of play is simply not so, and... and so there's very little that the State could come back with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.701" offset="14098306">But as a constitutional matter, if there was any play at the joints, absolutely, if the jury is told the truth that there's no parole, the jury can also be told the truth about any possibility of release that might exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.050" offset="14151805">We don't deny that for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.341" offset="14156925">But the State recognizes that the... that the real issue is the unavailability of parole, and that's why they fight this tooth and nail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.693" offset="14190362">Justice Ginsburg inquired about prior cases in which the State Supreme Court has reversed under Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.493" offset="14217529">And it's important to keep in mind there are only two, and they both involved cases that were tried before Simmons came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.189" offset="14248354">And that is why in one case the verbatim same argument about what to do with him when he is in our midst was made by the prosecutor because they didn't have Simmons as the script about what not to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.719" offset="14294434">But since Simmons came down and since prosecutors who are of a mind to defeat the rule in Simmons have had the... the facts of Simmons to go by, not one case by the South Carolina... the South Carolina Supreme Court has not reversed under Simmons in a single case, in every instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.306" offset="14368830">Now, it's true that occasionally trial judges have given a life without parole instruction under Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.661" offset="14398192">Oftentimes it's because a prosecutor, out of a basic sense of fairness, does not take the position that the prosecutor took in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.141" offset="14424106">We're really dealing with a due process rule where you sort of feel it in your heart that there's something wrong, and that applies to prosecutors and judges too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.445" offset="14457333">But when a prosecutor decides to... to use the Simmons script, they've had very good success in having this instruction not given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.472" offset="14497457">And I should say that if this... if these facts are now held by this high Court to be not to trigger the rule in Simmons, you will see that as being... as being the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.328" offset="14552837">Now, it's possible that the legislature will step in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.541" offset="14561719">It's equally possible, after such a large loophole in Simmons, a loophole that will swallow the entire case, is decided by this Court--</text>
