            <text syncTime="11.024" offset="190919">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.472" offset="208682">The issue in this case is whether the award of back pay to an undocumented alien who never was legally present or legally authorized to work in this country conflicts with this Court's holding in Sure-Tan or with this country's immigration laws and policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.652" offset="277332">In Sure-Tan, this Court held that the discriminatees in that case must be deemed unavailable for work and the accrual of back pay therefore tolled during any period when they were not lawfully entitled to be present and employed in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.319" offset="343996">The Sure-Tan Court's back pay limitation is consistent with the INA's dual requirement that to be employed in this country an alien must be both legally present and legally authorized to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.211" offset="395614">Despite this dual requirement, the board contends that Castro is entitled to back pay even though he never was legally present or legally authorized to work in this country during the back pay period.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.765" offset="449844">The fatal flaw in the board's position lies in its adherence to its physical availability doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.634" offset="481296">The board contends that this C- Court denied back pay to the discriminatees in Sure-Tan only because they had left the country and were physically unavailable for work.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.984" offset="526749">If the board is right, the Sure-Tan discriminatees could have illegally reentered the country to establish physical presence and to commence the accrual of back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.369" offset="572202">However, such reentry would violate the immigration laws of this country and be contrary to this Court's holding in Sure-Tan.</text>
