            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87373">I have the opinions of the Court to announce in two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.539" offset="101479">The first one is No. 01-687 United States against Cotton.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.924" offset="123004">Respondents led a vast drug conspiracy in Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.008" offset="139304">A federal grand jury indicted them charging them with conspiracy to possess and to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.096" offset="171696">The indictments did not specify the amount of crack cocaine involved in the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.591" offset="193639">The jury found respondents guilty of the crime charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.091" offset="207641">Consistent with the practice in Federal Courts at the time, the District Court made a finding of drug quantity at sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.683" offset="238047">The Court found one respondent responsible for at least 500 grams of cocaine; other respondent was responsible for at least 1.5 Kilograms of crack cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.269" offset="284441">For crimes involving 50 grams or more of crack cocaine, Congress authorized a penalty of up to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.537" offset="313489">Accordingly, the District Court sentenced two of the respondents to 30 years imprisonment and the remaining respondents to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.479" offset="345254">Without a finding of drug quantity, the maximum punishment is 20 years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.888" offset="366883">Respondents did not object in the District Court to the fact that they were sentenced based on a finding of drug quantity not alleged in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.190" offset="404082">While respondent's appeal was pending in the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, we decided Apprendi versus New Jersey in the Spring of 2000.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.990" offset="439295">Under Apprendi, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a petty jury, and in federal prosecutions must be alleged in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.587" offset="489659">Respondents then argued in the Court of Appeals that their sentence was error under Apprendi.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.364" offset="516826">The Court of Appeals recognized that respondents did not raise this argument in the District Court but nonetheless, vacated respondents’ sentences on the ground that the omission of drug quantity from the indictment was a jurisdictional error.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.766" offset="574400">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.567" offset="589551">The notion that this type of error is jurisdictional is derived from our 1887 decision in Ex parte Bain which stated that a defective indictment deprives a trial court of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.608" offset="649737">Bain, however, was decided in an error in which the Court’s authority to review criminal convictions was greatly circumscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.182" offset="680039">Direct review of criminal convictions in this Court was not available and the Court could grant a petition for writ of habeas only to correct jurisdictional errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.652" offset="721940">The Court does stretch the concept of jurisdiction so that it could correct obvious constitutional errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.241" offset="748271">Our later cases however, have rejected the idea that Indictment defects affect the court’s power to hear a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.388" offset="776901">To remove any doubt today, we overrule Bain in so far as it held that a defective indictment deprives the court of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.127" offset="811801">We thus apply ordinary plain error analysis to respondents’ claim since it was not raised in the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.022" offset="839386">Federal Courts will recognize an error, not raised in the District Court only if the error affects the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.333" offset="884630">Respondents do not satisfy this standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.173" offset="896020">The fairness, integrity, and public reputation of the judicial system depends on meeting out to those inflicting the greatest harm on society the most severe punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.731" offset="938233">The real threat then to the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings would be of respondents despite the overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence that they were involved in a vast drug conspiracy were to receive a sentence prescribed for those committing less substantial offenses because of an error that was never objected to in the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.788" offset="1022452">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.788" offset="1030498">The decision of the court is unanimous.</text>
