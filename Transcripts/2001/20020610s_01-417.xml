            <text syncTime="8.145" offset="120138">This case comes here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.404" offset="141245">The question before us is whether the petitioner, a member of the plaintiff’s class, certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1) who objected to the approval of a settlement at the fairness hearing may subsequently bring an appeal despite the fact that he is neither a named class representative, nor a successful intervener in the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.414" offset="245213">Reversing the Fourth Circuit, we hold that he can.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.744" offset="262558">This Court has held that only parties may properly bring an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.128" offset="280112">We have never restricted this rule however, to named parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.644" offset="298189">Petitioner’s interest is similar to those of non-parties we have allowed to appeal in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.259" offset="324625">He objected in the District Court and most importantly, he is bound by the District Court’s approval of the settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.848" offset="355031">This should be sufficient to trigger his right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.353" offset="369033">That right cannot be effectively accomplished through the named class representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.865" offset="391080">Once the class representative reaches a settlement with which another class member does not agree, their interest necessarily diverge.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.243" offset="428592">Allowing an appeal is necessary to protect petitioner’s interests in the settlement by which he has bound despite his expressed objections before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.296" offset="472791">We also reject the government’s suggestion that non-named class members should be required to first intervene for purposes of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.070" offset="507900">The government admits such intervention should be freely granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.691" offset="526395">We therefore, see little advantage to requiring the class members to go through the additional steps of seeking District Court approval of their right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.314" offset="564847">As no statute or rule of civil procedure requires such intervention, we decline to require it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.599" offset="594000">Justice Scalia has filed a descending opinion which Justices Kennedy and Thomas have joined.</text>
