            <text syncTime="685.474" offset="2882412">And if it decided that it wanted to somehow... if... if the language that... that Thomas Jefferson penned included plants in 1930 and it included sexual multiplication of plants and they wanted to limit it, then they could have just put in the asexual limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.495" offset="2954510">But what they did is, they put in all three sections in 1930 because it was their intent to expand the definitional limits of section 4886, which was the definitional language that Thomas Jefferson originally wrote.</text>

            <text syncTime="1389.362" offset="5697994">The reason that that provision is in there is because in 1970, the brokerage business in seed corn and cotton seed, soybean seed was already a thriving business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.334" offset="5745851">It was not the intent of Congress to inject itself into marketing situations that are governed by State law or by the Federal Seed Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1444.513" offset="5918572">Now, the 1970 Plant Variety Protection Act provides at section 2581 that the purpose of the act is to provide adequate encouragement for research.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.551" offset="5990775">Congress... the presidential commission was convened in 1965 to decide what sort of protection should we give to sexually reproducing plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.911" offset="6040198">In '68 the Senate Patent Subcommittee had hearings on amending title 35.</text>

            <text syncTime="1483.318" offset="6073844">It took no further action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.804" offset="6079800">Hearings continued in the Agriculture Department, and this 1970 PVP Act came out to... to provide adequate protection to encourage research.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.245" offset="6121491">That was Congress' intent in crafting this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.581" offset="6138837">They set up a separate agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.811" offset="6147823">They set up a separate board with mandated representation of affected political interests, including farmers, including the public sector, including researchers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.647" offset="6199127">They set up the seed saving exemption, the research exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.501" offset="6226504">Now, if... if the argument is accepted that, well, the reason that Congress did this was because they misapprehended the ability to... of technology to advance and make it easier to, say, identify or describe a plant variety or because of some other technological advance, well, if... that is simply saying that the intent of Congress in 1970 was based on a mistaken apprehension or something that's proved mistaken today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.281" offset="6373625">But to take that position assumes that if Congress had apprehended correctly, as Pioneer's amici said they should have, then that Congress would have simply adopted section 101 without the special agency, which... without the board, which is... which has to have representatives of experts from the various varieties, without seed saving, without research, without all of the distinctions that it specifically intentionally enacted in the Plant Variety Protection Act, and that is too great a leap for us to take in my... in a judicial setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.551" offset="6542794">It's a political question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.242" offset="6549482">It's a question for Congress to answer and Congress has answered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.444" offset="6570275">Everything that went into the crafting of the Plant Variety Protection Act was the result of politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.974" offset="6600473">And that is if... if in some fashion, which I see a lot... a lot of the... of Pioneer's and its amici's argument points out that, well, it now looks like its a better idea to have patent protection than Plant Variety Protection Act protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.418" offset="6670272">Well, that is an argument to be made in the... on the Hill to the Congress where they have the resources to examine all of this evidence that has been put before this Court in the amici briefs that is not in the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.932" offset="6736309">As far as the ease... the record... the evidence that's in the record in this case is that it's harder to get a Plant Variety Protection certificate because there was the corn hybrids that were patented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.900" offset="6804123">The inbred parents were not deposited, only the hybrid seed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.192" offset="6821364">The hybrid seed, when you plant it, you get all different types of plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.785" offset="6835679">You cannot recreate the hybrid without having the inbred parents' deposit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.382" offset="6854069">The PVP requires deposit of the inbred seed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.073" offset="6872878">The PVP requires that you give the breeding history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.198" offset="6889387">There's no requirement of that for the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.625" offset="6903075">The PVP allows the research exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.886" offset="6916136">Why is that important?</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.198" offset="6925331">Because of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.330" offset="6929824">The DNA in plants is a storehouse of knowledge, a storehouse of genetic knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.917" offset="6956260">The RNA conveys that message and the message is manifested in the characteristics of the offspring of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.976" offset="6984473">Only when you have... when a plant breeder has the opportunity to actually grow the plant, observe it, cross it, observe and test the offspring can the plant breeder obtain the knowledge that is in the ostensibly patented plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.923" offset="7060228">And without that... without that opportunity, then the full disclosure that supposedly is made under the Patent Act when they patent plant varieties is not... is not made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.967" offset="7120414">And it is... it is an extremely important matter that the Plant Variety Protection Act guarantees to the public, and that is the free use and transmission of genetic material, which patents are being used to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.867" offset="7191989">There's been, as you know, a extreme consolidation of the agricultural industry, and the switch to patents and the locking up of plant germ plasm is a key impetus in that consolidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.790" offset="7259699">If there are no further questions, I'll reserve the rest of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1786.023" offset="7284672">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In response to my colleague's representation that Pioneer's sole case here rests upon a snippet of statement in the legislative history of the '52 act, quoted in Chakrabarty where the Court said, machined or manufactured can include anything under the sun made by man, we do, of course, rely on that piece of legislative history, as did Chakrabarty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.911" offset="7440153">But our case rests not upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.140" offset="7449139">Our case rests upon 35 U.S.C., section 101, which is in the regular patent statute that says, and the plain meaning of those words, as confirmed in Chakrabarty, that the corn plants that are patented here are either articles of manufacture or compositions of matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.285" offset="7529700">Or the fact of the matter is, under the definitions cited with approval in Chakrabarty, they're both because these categories of statutory subject matter, under section 101... that is, they are sort of a gatekeeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.813" offset="7587797">You got to pass through that gate to go on to the next criteria of whether you are new, useful, or nonobvious and can get a patent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1883.072" offset="7672851">But in this case, the under the sun language shows that they are such expansive terms in 101, that perhaps we don't apply that usual rule and that you would prevail because of the terms being so general and so universal in their... in their coverage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1950.772" offset="7943584">As I understand it, the... the outline of the argument is even though the language in 101 is indeed just as broad as... as you say and even though Chakrabarty said living things aren't excluded, the existence of... of a separate statute dealing with the same subject matter may be taken as... as an implied repeal to some extent if there's a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.466" offset="8038461">And one argument for saying that there is no conflict here, as I understand it, is the argument that what is set up by section 101 on the one hand and the two separate plant statutes on the other are really two separate regimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.927" offset="8108260">It's harder to get a 101 patent, so you get more protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="2189.864" offset="8899980">And the reason historically that it came about that we have these three separate regimes that occur for plants is that plant inventors, if you will, were being discriminated against in that they were unable to comply with the rigorous requirements of title 35 for a regular utility patent not because there was any definitional wrong in section 101, but because in application, the Patent Office was routinely rejecting them... and I'm talking about prior to 1930... as products of nature, and the inventors were unable to meet the written description requirement necessary to get a patent, so important to a patent because the written description requirement is how the public benefits from the knowledge from the patent so that they can use it to advance and build greater knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.182" offset="9121289">And so, the Plant Patent Act of 1930 was passed to allow some limited rights for asexually reproduced plants, and the Plant Variety Protection Act of 1970 was passed to allow again some rights for sexually produced plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.667" offset="9187222">Now, this petitioner would turn those two acts and their legislative history on their head and use them to limit patent coverage when, in fact, they were passed by Congress for the purpose of granting some coverage that was like a patent in order to get over the two historical hurdles of section 112, written description requirement, and the so-called product of nature doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="2937.877" offset="11892045">So, Congress passed a law which is implementing and enhancing the very thing that is occurring here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.564" offset="11918794">And to make any doubt about that crystal clear, in 1994, when there were amendments to the Patent Variety Protection Act, Senator Kerrey set out the whole regime in the legislative history of that modification that occurred in 1994, explaining utility patents, explaining Plant Variety Protection Act certificates, and explaining the PPA, and noting the differences between them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.930" offset="12332260">The Court in Chakrabarty rejected the position of the Government and of the dissenting Justices that those two statutes showed a congressional understanding that living things are not protectable under section 101 and could be protected only insofar as that subject matter was covered in those two statutes and to the extent to which it was covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.577" offset="12454827">The Court, instead, adopted a... a broad interpretation based on the plain meaning of section 101 referring to the anything under the sun quotation, but also said quite specifically at page 313 of volume 447 that the relevant distinction is not between living and inanimate things for purposes of applying 101, but between products of nature, whether living or not, and human-made inventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.587" offset="12610935">So, there is no doubt that all categories of living things are within the interpretation of 101 that the Court adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.973" offset="12652417">And the anomaly of this case is that in petitioners' contention, the Court is being asked to disfavor, for purposes of applying section 101, and indeed, to exclude from eligibility for section 101 protection the very subject matter for which Congress had shown special solicitude and saw a particular need for patent protection in these two acts at a time when it was doubtful whether living things could get section 101 protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="3243.516" offset="13114576">As of September 30th of this year, the Department of Agriculture had issued 5,022 plant variety certificates, whereas, as we explain in our brief, there have been a total of 1,800 utility patents issued for plants or plant components such as seeds and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.949" offset="13232336">The... the PVPA protection, the Plant Variety Protection Act, is only on the plant variety itself so that the availability of patents on seeds and other plant parts is available only under section 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.449" offset="13302344">The court in Chakrabarty itself said that nothing in the language or legislative history of the Plant Variety Protection Act indicated any intention to limit section 101 availability for patents when the standards of section 101 are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.875" offset="13388025">And as a matter of fact, the relevant committee report on the PVPA in 1970, which we quote on page 22 in our brief in the middle of the page, said quite specifically that that statute, the PVPA, quote, does not alter protection currently available within the patent system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.229" offset="13485514">So, we see no incompatibility between the two systems of protection.</text>
