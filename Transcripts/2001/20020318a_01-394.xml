            <text syncTime="53.015" offset="359768">May it please the Court: I represent current and former Government officials who have been sued in their individual capacity based on a claim for denial of access to the courts and the further claim that they violated clearly established law as of nineteen ninety-three, thus negating their defense of qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.510" offset="429776">The substantive due process right of access claim urged here is extremely expansive and unsupported by the Court's precedents.</text>

            <text syncTime="81.724" offset="474602">The right of access is not violated unless an individual is, in fact, barred from filing claims in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.735" offset="502605">In limited circumstances, far different from those at issue here, the Court has recognized that an actual bar to access in the courts implicates the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.624" offset="538236">Here there is no denial of access to the courts under this Court's precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.900" offset="555268">The claim asserted here, moreover, would constitutionalize the handling of informal channels of communication between Government officials and private citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.449" offset="593511">It's entirely foreseeable that recognizing this claim would cause the flow of information to the public to be reduced to stultifying forms of pretrial discovery.</text>
