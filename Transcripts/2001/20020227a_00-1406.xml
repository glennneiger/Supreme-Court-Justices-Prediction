            <text syncTime="11.683" offset="202057">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: According to the National Institutes of Health, hepatitis C kills 8,000 to 10,000 people in this country every year, and it's the largest cause of liver transplants.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.975" offset="255242">This is a progressive disease, which in many cases goes without any symptoms for a period of time, but in a large percentage of cases, it results in cirrhosis and liver failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.832" offset="298606">The disease in this instance was chronic, active, and severe, according to the standards of the NIH.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.179" offset="327967">Now, NIOSH's Occupational Health Guidelines also confirm that the chemicals in this factory were liver toxins.</text>

            <text syncTime="56.925" offset="383033">But the Government's guidelines say again and again that employees should receive medical tests before beginning work to look out for special vulnerability.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.668" offset="422008">NIOSH's statement about phenol, one of the 12 chemicals here, is typical, and I quote from the guideline.</text>

            <text syncTime="76.161" offset="459938">Persons with a history of abnormalities of the liver would be expected to be at increased risk from exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.592" offset="489717">Now, none of this matters according to the Ninth Circuit because injury to self is beyond the employer's legitimate concern.</text>

            <text syncTime="1094.014" offset="4531383">The plaintiff has the burden of proof to show that he can perform the essential fundamental job tasks of the job and that he satisfies the employer's other qualification standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.735" offset="4578194">Now, if a particular qualification standard screens out someone because he is disabled, then the burden shifts to the employer to justify that standard as job-related and consistent with business necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.284" offset="4628454">And what... the EEOC's regulatory threat to self regulation is one example of a subset of a valid standard that is job-related and consistent with business necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.596" offset="4673698">The statute recognizes that a valid qualification standard may include a safety requirement that an individual not pose a safety threat to others in the work place.</text>

            <text syncTime="3502.305" offset="14164506">The Court discussed both kinds of danger, danger to the individual and danger to other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.846" offset="14182687">And this Court twice has said in Dothard... in Beezer... the Beezer case later... that safety is a paradigm business necessity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3520.880" offset="14238798">And this is not a statute that cut out risks to self.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.814" offset="14250606">This is a statute that included risks to self in the business necessity defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.394" offset="14268891">That's generic language that encompasses it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.502" offset="14277355">And there was a long line of cases that Congress meant to adopt under the Rehab Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.588" offset="14293655">They didn't disapprove those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.212" offset="14300134">In fact, business necessity is repeated four different times in the statute, and it's applied specifically to medical examinations of the individual employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.576" offset="14341616">Congress wasn't talking about general tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.722" offset="14350184">It was talking about examinations like the one given to Mr. Echazabal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.559" offset="14365544">Now, this Court has held that under the business necessity defense, it will not substitute its judgment for the employer's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.444" offset="14397100">All that is needed is a reasonable relationship to a legitimate business objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.152" offset="14415908">There certainly is a legitimate business objective here in saving this individual's life and promoting safety in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.385" offset="14440881">Was the judgment a reasonable one?</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.530" offset="14449450">We had four opinions from experienced physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.874" offset="14462824">We spoke with Mr. Echazabal's own physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.763" offset="14474318">We told him, did you realize this man would be exposed to liver toxins, and he said, no, that should not be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.162" offset="14499918">Someone with hepatitis C can't even have a drink of alcohol, much less liver toxins.</text>
