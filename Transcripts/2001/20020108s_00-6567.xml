            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87750">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 00-6567, Dusenbery against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.319" offset="117007">The issue before us in this case is whether the FBI's sending of a forfeiture notice by certified mail to a prisoner housed at a federal correctional facility with procedures for delivering the mail to its inmate satisfies due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.449" offset="177507">We hold that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.317" offset="184926">Petitioner was arrested in 1986 at a house trailer in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.171" offset="204361">Later that day FBI officers executed a search warrant for the premises and seized drugs, guns, miscellaneous property items in a total of some $21,000 in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.482" offset="253575">Two years after the petitioner pleaded guilty to drug possession charges, the FBI obtained an order from the District Court to destroy the firearms which were no longer needed as evidence, and started the process of administratively forfeiting the cash and other properties seized under the Controlled Substances Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.620" offset="326196">It sent notice of its intention to forfeit the cash by certified mail to petitioner at the federal prison where he was being held.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.575" offset="357961">It also published legal notice for three weeks in a Cleveland newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.147" offset="376246">The FBI received no response from these notices and so it declared the cash forfeited.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.600" offset="402055">Nearly five years later, petitioner sought return of this property in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.851" offset="423058">The District Court held the FBI's notice by certified mail satisfied due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.736" offset="442597">The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.680" offset="450434">In an opinion filed with the Clerk of the Court today, we affirm that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.182" offset="468406">This case is governed by the principle announced in Mullane versus Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.915" offset="495365">There we said that when the government seeks to deprive persons of property, the due process clause requires notice reasonably calculated under all the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.234" offset="536638">To apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.427" offset="565373">In this case, the government showed that notice was sent by certified mail to petitioner at the correctional facility where he was located.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.311" offset="596929">At that facility, prison mail room staff went to the city post office everyday to pick up inmate mail, sign for the certified mail and entered it in a prison mail room logbook.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.051" offset="643949">A member of the inmate' Unit Team then sign for the certified mail before taking it in from the mail room and delivering it the inmate during mail call.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.712" offset="682506">The FBI's method of sending the notice was reasonably calculated, we hold to apprise petitioner the fortifier.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.370" offset="709151">The claim by petitioner that he did not actually received the letter is insufficient to render the notice constitutionally defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.866" offset="743214">None of our cases have required proof of receipt instead the Government may defend its chosen method on the ground that it  is reasonably certain to inform those effected.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.441" offset="785428">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens, Souter and Breyer joined.</text>
