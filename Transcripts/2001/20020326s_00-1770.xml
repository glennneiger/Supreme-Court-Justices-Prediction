            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87590">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 00-1770, Department of Housing and Urban Development versus Rucker.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.183" offset="136282">With drug dealers increasingly imposing a reign of terror on public and other federally assisted law-income housing tenants as Congress put it, Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.896" offset="191139">The Act states that each public housing agency shall use leases providing that any drug-related criminal activity on or off the premises engaged in by a public housing tenant, any member of the tenant’s household, or any guest or other person under the tenant’s control shall be cause for termination of tenancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.304" offset="272746">The open-housing authority included this language and its leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.414" offset="289151">In 1997, 1998, the Housing Authority instituted an eviction proceedings against the four respondents in this case who are tenants alleging violations of the lease provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.341" offset="336903">The complaint alleged that the grandsons of the two of the tenants were caught in the apartment complex parking lot smoking marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.565" offset="365846">The daughter of another tenant was found with cocaine three blocks from the apartment, and then on three occasions the caretaker of still another tenant was found with cocaine in his apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.528" offset="413598">Department Regulations state that a local public Housing Authority’s discretion to evict tenants for drug-related activity includes those situations wherein which the tenant did not know could not foresee or could not control behavior of other occupants of the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.570" offset="489771">After the eviction proceedings were initiated in State Court, the tenants brought this action in the Federal Court against both HUD and the Authority, arguing that the statute does not permit eviction when a tenant did not know of and had not reason to know of the drug activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.594" offset="553928">The District Court issued an injunction in joining the Housing Authority from terminating the leases of tenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.927" offset="583290">A divided en banc panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.232" offset="604501">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.021" offset="619652">The statute unambiguously requires lease terms that give local public Housing Authorities the discretion to evict tenants for drug-related activity of household members and guest regardless of whether the tenant know or should have known about the activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.989" offset="679525">The statute uses the word any which has an expansive meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.556" offset="697810">Any drug-related activity engaged in by the specified person's ground for termination not just drug-related activity that the tenant knew of.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.520" offset="745667">This plain reading of the statute does not lead to observe results as the Court of Appeals thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.895" offset="767087">No-fault eviction is a common feature of landlord tenant law and maximizes deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.843" offset="790911">It also serves Congress’ purpose of ridding public housing projects off drug activity, whether or not a tenant has knowledge of the drug activity committed by members of a tenant’s household or guest creates a dangerous environment for other residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.911" offset="855172">Nor does the statute raise significant constitutional concerns as the Court of Appeals thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.496" offset="877533">A Housing Authority is not imposing criminal or civil liability on a tenant for the acts of others; it is instead acting as a landlord of property it owns and invoking a least cost towards the tenant is agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.699" offset="930300">There is no indication that guarantees the procedural due process had been denied in the State proceedings where the eviction will eventually be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.931" offset="967290">All members of the Court have joined in this opinion except Justice Breyer who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
