            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87609">The opinion of the Court in No. 01-408 Holmes Group, Inc. versus Vornado Air Circulation Systems will be announced by Justice Scalia.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="10.042" offset="127733">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.445" offset="149362">It involves a rather technical question concerning the jurisdiction of that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.746" offset="170574">Petitioner filed a Federal Court action seeking a declaratory judgment that its products did not infringe respondent’s trade dress and in an injunction restraining respondent from accusing it of such infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.055" offset="227730">Respondent’s answer asserted a compulsory patent infringement counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.722" offset="254479">The District Court ruled in favor of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.289" offset="268690">Respondent then appealed to the Federal Circuit instead of the Regional Court of Appeals, which in this case would have been the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.540" offset="301709">The Federal Circuit, notwithstanding the petitioner’s challenge to its jurisdiction, vacated the District Court’s judgment and remanded the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.235" offset="336504">We granted certiorari and now vacate and remand with instructions to transfer this case to the Court of Appeals to the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.245" offset="372553">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1295(a)(1), the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over “an appeal from a final decision of a District Court of the United States if the jurisdiction of that court was based in whole or in part on 28 U.S.C. Section 1338.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.520" offset="465653">28 U.S.C. Section 1338(a) gives District Courts jurisdiction over civil actions “arising under", magic words to lawyers, "arising under federal patent law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="111.230" offset="532527">Because 1338(a) uses the same operative language, arising under, as 28 U.S.C. Section 1331 which confers general federal question jurisdiction on the District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.149" offset="588115">We held in a case called Christianson versus Colt Industries Operating Corporation that the well-pleaded complaint rule governing whether a case arises under 1331 also governs whether a case arises under Section 1338(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="141.561" offset="653839">As adapted to Section 1338(a), that well-pleaded complaint rule provides that whether a case arises under patent law is determined by what appears in the plaintiff’s well-pleaded complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.225" offset="704412">That is a complaint that does not have surplus agenda.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.757" offset="718623">Because petitioner’s well-pleaded complaint asserted no claim arising under federal patent law but just the trade dress claim, the Federal Circuit erred in asserting jurisdiction over this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.020" offset="767629">We are not persuaded by respondent’s argument that the well-pleaded complaint rule allows a counterclaim to serve as the basis for a District Courts arising under jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.156" offset="808171">To accept this argument would contravene the face of the complaint principle set forth in our prior cases and the long standing policies furthered by that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.802" offset="846727">It would leave acceptance or rejection of a State Forum to the master of the counterclaim rather than to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.204" offset="876402">It would radically expand the class of removable cases, and it would undermine the clarity and ease of administration of the well-pleaded complaint doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.823" offset="918825">We are also not persuaded by respondent’s alternative argument that reading Section 1295(a)(1) and Section 1338(a) to confer appellate jurisdiction on the Federal Circuit whenever a patent law counterclaim is raised is necessary to effect congress’ goal of promoting patent law uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.791" offset="1010672">This Court’s task is not to determine what would further congress’ goal but to determine what the statute’s words must fairly be understood to mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.375" offset="1045049">It would be impossible to say that section 1338(a)’s arising under language means the well-pleaded complaint rule when read on its own, but means respondent’s complaint or counterclaim rule when it is referred to by Section 1295(a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="259.072" offset="1123834">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment; Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice O’Connor has joined.</text>
