            <text syncTime="54.863" offset="371780">First, the Ninth Circuit improperly permits tolling for substantial delay if the State Supreme Court addresses the merits when denying an application for collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.130" offset="416815">Second, under California's system of successive original petitions, nothing is pending under State or Federal law following the denial of an application for collateral review and prior to the proper filing of a new application for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.000" offset="480344">And third, the gap theory relied upon by the district court more accurately reflects congressional intent and the policy judgments underlying AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations than does the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of pending--</text>

            <text syncTime="118.765" offset="627362">However, within a reasonable time has parameters which I can give you the case of In re Harris, a California Supreme Court case, which addresses that.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.538" offset="670411">Specifically, it says the following in footnote 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.641" offset="686816">That's... the cite is 5 Cal. 4th at 828-829.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.232" offset="729239">Footnote 7 says the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.629" offset="738852">The general rule regarding timeliness is the habeas corpus petition must be filed within a reasonable time after the petitioner counsel knew or with due diligence should have known the facts underlying the claim, as well as the legal basis of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.836" offset="791620">They then follow that up with two significant points.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.354" offset="801755">The first is, is that ineffective assistance of counsel claims, which is the claim in this particular litigation, should be filed as a verified... excuse me... a verified petition jointly with the direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.009" offset="860374">In other words, if you know about the claim, you should file it at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.013" offset="876361">Now, as far as how long you should be able to wait, the rules specifically state with regard to capital cases, which are considered to be much more complex than the average non-capital case, they give them a 90-day period in which there is a presumption of timeliness so that there is no substantial delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.703" offset="955146">You have a presumption that you have not exceeded substantial delay if you do it within 90 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="3481.261" offset="14077393">--That would... that would undermine the so-called gap theory in every State but... but California where typically you do have appeals on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.806" offset="14111561">In California, you have a State appeal and a functional appeal on the petitioner's side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.264" offset="14129324">And so, the argument could be made... I think it's a hyper-technical argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.146" offset="14144893">I think it's an argument that's inconsistent with the purpose of this statute, but you could make the hyper-technical argument that because California gives unequal rights to the two sides, an appeal on the one hand and a functional appeal on the other, we're going to treat the functional appeal in a different way for Federal purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.002" offset="14212289">I would submit there is no way that Congress intended to take a functional appeal that has the purpose of... of presenting claims that are required for exhaustion and said, we want to treat that differently because it's merely a functional appeal, not a real appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.294" offset="14277491">That makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.531" offset="14282402">All of the reasons why tolling should apply in the gaps prescribed by the State, the period the State believes is appropriate for the presentation of these claims, the period the State believes prisoners should have in order to prepare and present their claims, that we're not going to toll that, the consequence of that will be that petitioners will not wait for the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.503" offset="14366307">They will file their... their motions in the... in the court of appeal without transcripts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.704" offset="14387100">They will not develop their arguments well, and then those arguments will finally be made for the first time effectively in the Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.103" offset="14412700">That is not what was intended by the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3570.343" offset="14433703">I think the answer to Mr. Ogden, Your Honor, is that the reason would be that Congress was concerned about undue delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.887" offset="14467871">In the last 10 years before AEDPA was passed, over 80 bills were attempted to... to deal with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.710" offset="14491172">And lack of diligence by petitioners was the main concern of Congress, and they dealt with that by writing into the statute the following phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.088" offset="14524609">2244(d)(2) at page 3 of the blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.950" offset="14548119">Quote, the time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any limitation under this subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.831" offset="14599633">They did not choose to use the... the language petition in 2263(b)(2), nor did they choose to use the language in 2244(d)(1)(A) of the time for seeking such review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.296" offset="14649474">They chose application for the reason that Justice Scalia was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.076" offset="14668596">They were concerned that there would be undue delay in between applications.</text>
