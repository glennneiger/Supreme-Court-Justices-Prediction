            <text syncTime="3536.826" offset="14302611">Just a few quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.418" offset="14304910">With respect to the proffer and somebody being willing to put their credibility on the line, the defendant actually took the stand during the... the colloquy on the continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.671" offset="14342004">He was sworn, which actually you would think is a superior form of proof to an affidavit, and there he was subject to cross-examination by the prosecutor, if there had been any questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.762" offset="14382337">She didn't have any other than to clarify that the witnesses had been under subpoena, which they had been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.090" offset="14403653">And... and so, I... I think that the... that whole like of inquiry about whether somebody is willing to sort of swear to facts in support of the motion sort of falls by the wayside because he was on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.327" offset="14448584">In addition, in terms of what... what all the players in the sea knew about... about these witnesses, there's a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.343" offset="14480662">It's rule 25.05 of the Missouri rules that requires a notice of an alibi to be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.133" offset="14499784">Apparently one was given because the prosecutor came prepared in her opening statement to address briefly the fact that there was an alibi defense that she expected to be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.149" offset="14539908">And in addition, the detectives interviewed these witnesses while they were in Kansas City and took statements from them, and if there was any question later, as the record developed further in Federal court, about whether these witnesses really would have said what... what they said they were going to say, the State had whatever notes or statements that was taken from the interviews that were done with these witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3690.997" offset="14919206">So... so, the Due Process Clause is... is explicitly stated there and... and thereafter.</text>
