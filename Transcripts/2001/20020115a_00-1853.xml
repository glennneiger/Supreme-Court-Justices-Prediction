            <label>Mr. Harold I. Goodman</label>
            <text syncTime="14.992" offset="207690">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case brings up for review a fairly straightforward but nonetheless essential question as it applies to Federal practice and procedure, namely, whether or not notice pleading is sufficient with compliance with Rule 8(a)(2), or whether or not the rule requires some element of fact pleading to overcome a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.203" offset="316568">It arises in the context of a title VII national origin and an age discrimination case under the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.696" offset="354498">Mr. Swierkiewicz was fired from his job by Sorema, his former employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.408" offset="377381">He brought suit in the district court claiming that that firing was based upon his national origin... he's Hungarian... and his age.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.099" offset="416147">He was about 51 at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.286" offset="424924">He pled that there was no valid reason for his discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.254" offset="448748">He pointed to the fact that he himself had incurred a history over 2 years of discrimination based on his national origin and his age, coming from 1995, when he was demoted from his position as chief underwriting officer, through and including two successive years where he was the victim of continuous discrimination by being excluded from meetings, business decisions, and isolated and denied any career growth.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.251" offset="580718">The Second Circuit, affirming the Southern District of New York, concluded that conclusory allegations of discrimination, what it referred to as naked allegations, were insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.846" offset="635157">Some facts had to be proved, proved via a complaint, because it adopted as a pleading standard this Court's elements of a prima facie case in McDonnell Douglas v. Green.</text>

            <text syncTime="218.731" offset="1022710">So we contrast what the Second Circuit did with three critical barometers.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.030" offset="1047892">The first and most critical are these Court's precedents, starting, of course, with Conley in 1957, a case brought under the Railway Labor Act claiming that the union did not fairly represent the interests of African American conductors and porters.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.272" offset="1116855">As Justice Black, writing for the Court, said, the allegations were entirely general, but in response to the union's argument that more specificity, some specificity had to be alleged, the Court wrote, the law requires unions to represent minorities on the same basis as nonminorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.595" offset="1202119">That--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="263.894" offset="1203373">Mr. Goodman, why do you start with Conley v. Gibson rather than Dioguardi v. Durning.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.027" offset="1235869">I thought that was always the classic.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harold_i_goodman" startTime="273.942" stopTime="277.942">
            <label>Mr. Harold I. Goodman</label>
            <text syncTime="273.942" offset="1243497">--Dioguardi is my favorite case, simply because it has been authored by then Judge and later Chief Judge Clark, who was the reporter for this Court's advisory committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.518" offset="1285815">It was decided in 1944, and the argument the Government made in opposition to the complaint, which was a pro se complaint, was simply that some facts had to be alleged to support the plaintiff's claims that the Government a) had undersold his medicinal tonic, and b) had lost two cases of his medicinal tonic, to which Judge Clark said, no, the time for ascertaining the facts under the new Federal system, then 6 years old, was through discovery, and if the case was nonmeritorious, through summary judgment, but it's enough that this pro se litigant simply said, you deprived me of my goods, you undersold my property.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold I. Goodman</label>
            <text syncTime="338.678" offset="1502527">--I do, indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.766" offset="1506811">I do, indeed, and that's why I started with Conley, but it is interesting and, I think, prophetic, that footnote 5 of Conley cites Dioguardi with approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.470" offset="1549652">Now, in Conley the Court rebuffed unanimously the claim that some specificity had to be embossed upon the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.680" offset="1586537">17 years later, in Scheuer, again a unanimous court then through Chief Justice Burger rebuffed claims by Ohio that the National Guard and the Governor of Ohio, who were defendants, were sued on a 1983 damage claim with only the bare allegation that the National Guard had done wrong and was responsible for the deaths of the plaintiffs in that case, rebuffing unanimously the argument that some facts had be pled.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.264" offset="1728852">The Court turned aside that holding and that case of the Sixth Circuit and, indeed, said, you do not need to do it in a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.043" offset="1771902">Notice pleading, as we pointed out in Conley, is more than sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.246" offset="1788725">You will have sufficient time to flesh out issues, to learn facts in discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.440" offset="1809518">Had that been the end of the trilogy, it would have been enough, but, as this Court knows, just 9 years ago, 8 years ago, in 1993 in Leatherman, again confronted with a similar issue in a 1983 municipal liability case, the Court had to decide whether or not some facts were essential to a 1983 failure-to-train case under Canton.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.790" offset="1926965">The decision of the Sixth Circuit, which was accepted on review, had said in no uncertain terms the complaint here alleges no facts, none, to support the failure-to-train case.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.678" offset="1990495">In response, the Court, through the Chief Justice, unanimously said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.459" offset="2013587">We meant what we said in Conley.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.638" offset="2026335">Rule 8(a)(2) is sufficient if a plaintiff provides information that puts a defendant on notice of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.030" offset="2063846">That's all that's required.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.486" offset="2069698">If, today, we had to revise the rules there is a process for doing that and that might result, for 1983 purposes, in a revision to Rule 8(a)(2) such as that 9(a)(2), which now only requires particularity in cases of fraud and mistake, might have a third entry for particularity purposes, a 1983 action, for example, or here.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.894" offset="2187353">If, upon proper review and the process of this Court's committee and its adoption of rules and those by Congress, it was felt that a title VII case or an age case ought to also require particularity, that would be the time and that would be the place to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.902" offset="2263422">But I submit that there are two substantial other reasons for reversal here, and they are bedded in the Federal rules and have not changed in six decades, and they emanate from Rule 84, the rule, scarcely utilized, but is important in this case, which simply says the forms, the official forms that are attached to the rules, are sufficient for Federal pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.184" offset="2368539">In particular, Rule, or a Form 5 deals with goods sold and delivered.</text>

            <text syncTime="3447.164" offset="13936395">He alleges that these other individuals in the company were French national.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.561" offset="13958024">In his EEOC charge he makes clear that he regards them as French citizens and, in fact, one of them, one of these French nationals is actually of Greek heritage, so the discrimination that we re talking about here is really not based on national origin at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.039" offset="14027928">It's based on citizenship and, as this Court knows from Espinoza, that is not covered by title VII.</text>
