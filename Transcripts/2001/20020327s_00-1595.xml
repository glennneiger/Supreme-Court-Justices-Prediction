            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87814">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 00-1595, Hoffman Plastic Compounds versus the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.185" offset="124490">Petitioner Hoffman Plastic Compounds hired Jose Castro after Castro tendered documents appearing to verify his authorization to work in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.285" offset="164927">Petitioner later fired Castro and other employees after they supported a union-organizing campaign at petitioner’s plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.128" offset="196274">The Board found these layoffs to violate the National Labor Relations Act and ordered Hoffman to award backpay to Castro and other workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.226" offset="232637">At a hearing to determine the amount of backpay to be awarded, Castro testified that he was an illegal alien and that he fraudulently gained employment with petitioner by tendering a birth certificate that was not his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.671" offset="286449">The Board nonetheless ordered petitioner to pay Castro $66,000 in backpay plus interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.807" offset="314975">The Court of Appeals enforced the Board’s orders in an opinion filed with Clerk of the Court of today, we reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.752" offset="342769">We have consistently set aside the Board’s backpay awards to employees found guilty of serious illegal conduct in connection with their employment that is precisely the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.090" offset="388118">The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 expressly prohibit the employment of illegal aliens in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.623" offset="422286">This statute among other things makes it a criminal offense for any illegal alien to gain employment by tendering false or fraudulent document.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.672" offset="458439">There is no dispute that Castro’s use of a false birth certificate to gain employment with petitioner violated this criminal provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.752" offset="490727">To award him backpay moreover would require that he violate other provisions of the immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.247" offset="516745">The Board admits that Castro qualifies his backpay only so long as he remains inside the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.930" offset="543494">But Castro can only remain the United States illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.636" offset="562302">The Board further admits that Castro has a duty to mitigate his damages by seeking new employment but Castro can only seek new employment illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.538" offset="601904">In light of these factors, we need not defer to the Board’s remedial authority under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.560" offset="630012">Deference is inappropriate where the Board chooses a remedy that trenches upon federal statutes or policies outside the Board’s competence to administer, such as those relating to the Federal Immigration Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.041" offset="679958">We have recognized in previous cases that the Provisions of IRCA violated here our central to Federal Immigration Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.566" offset="714021">Therefore, however broad the Board’s discretion to fashion remedy is when dealing only with a National Labor Relations Act, it is simply not so vagrant and unbounded as to it authorized this sort of an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.789" offset="766893">Justice Brerye has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg join.</text>
