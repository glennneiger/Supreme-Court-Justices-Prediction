            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="8.154" offset="120221">This is a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.851" offset="130983">The two respondents, Drayton and Brown, were arrested and convicted for possession of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.900" offset="151150">The police found the drugs after conducting a patdown search.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.747" offset="170585">When Drayton and Brown were passengers on a bus going from Florida to Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.248" offset="188557">In Tallahassee, three Tallahassee police officers, with the driver’s permission, boarded the Greyhound Bus during a scheduled stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.193" offset="220322">One officer stayed in front of the driver’s seat and looked backward, the second officer went to the rear and looked forward, and the third officer worked his way from the back to the front speaking with the individual passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.896" offset="271104">Drayton and Brown were seated together.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.478" offset="285524">When the officer reached them, he talked to Brown first and asked whether he could search the suitcase on the overhead rack.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.677" offset="318229">There are many details in these opinions and we cannot summarize them all here, but the details are important in these search cases and the event that went on with reference to the bag has some significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.071" offset="375803">But in any event, Brown agreed and a search of the bag revealed no contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.468" offset="393462">The officer then asked Brown whether he could check Brown’s person, and Brown agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.700" offset="410389">The patdown search revealed objects similar to drug packages on Brown’s person.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.745" offset="430556">They were strapped it appears with adhesive taped in his inner thighs under his clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.003" offset="459604">Brown was arrested and taken off the bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.680" offset="470262">The police officer returned and asked Drayton for Drayton’s consent to a patdown, Drayton gave consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.422" offset="493249">He too was arrested when drugs were found with similar packages similarly concealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.760" offset="518640">The statements the officer made to the passengers are important and as vindicated we will not recount every detail here.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.429" offset="545285">Suffusive to say that the police officer identified himself, spoke in quite tones to each person and asked for permission to examine the baggage, and in Brown and Drayton’s case, to search their person.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.368" offset="589067">He did not however, tell the passengers they had a right to refuse to give consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.593" offset="609964">The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.192" offset="620309">It held the search was not voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.555" offset="629818">The basis of the Court of Appeals’ reversal was because bus passengers do not feel free to disregard an officer’s request to search in circumstances like these absent some positive indication that the consent may be refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.931" offset="687287">We now reverse the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.173" offset="696273">We conclude that the behavior and the statements of the officer did not constitute the seizure of the passengers within the bus or of Drayton and Brown in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.794" offset="730755">The officer gave the passengers no reason to believe that they were required to answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.938" offset="751339">The officer did not brandish a weapon or make any intimidating movements; he left the isle free so that the respondents could exit.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.789" offset="778716">He spoke to passengers one by one and in a polite quiet voice, nothing he said would suggest to a reasonable person that he or she was barred from leaving the bus or otherwise, terminating the encounter.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.657" offset="822183">Under our precedents, the officer’s display of his badge was not dispositive, and because it is well-known in our society that most officers are armed, the presence of a holstered firearm is unlikely to be coheresive absent act of brandishing of the weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.920" offset="887280">That one officer remained in the front of the bus also does not tip the scale to respondents since he did nothing to intimidate the passengers and said or did nothing to suggest the people could exit.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.984" offset="939525">What I have said before relates to whether or not there was a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.676" offset="954258">In addition to not being seized, the respondents were not subjected to an unreasonable search., and this is because their consent to the search was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.438" offset="989367">Whereas here, the question of voluntariness pervades both the search and seizure inquiries, the respective analysis turns on very similar facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.196" offset="1032312">Officers need not always inform citizens of their right to refuse when seeking permission to conduct a warrantless consent search.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.653" offset="1058226">In a society based on law, the concept of agreement and consent should be given a weight and dignity of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.818" offset="1086856">Police officers act in full accord with the law when they ask citizens for consent, and it reenforces the rule of law for the citizen to advice the police of his or her wishes, and for the police to act in reliance on that understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.232" offset="1140459">When this exchange takes place, it dispels inferences of coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.222" offset="1156446">Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens and Ginsburg join.</text>
