            <text syncTime="155.641" offset="770663">In this case, Justice O'Connor, I think all would agree that it is difficult to exercise a right that one does not know that one has, and in this case the Secretary decided that the employer must first choose to that the FMLA that the worker will get the FMLA rights, and then tell the employee, and this regulation promotes communication, communication between the employer and the employee.</text>
