            <text syncTime="7.572" offset="117815">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.610" offset="146027">Respondent, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, holds 17 utility patents for its inbred and hybrid corn seeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.708" offset="186360">Petitioner, J.E.M. Ag Supply, doing business as Farm Advantage, purchase Pioneer’s patent of hybrid seeds and reslae them in violation of the limited label license attached to the bags of seeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.478" offset="245501">Pioneer brought suit for patent infringement against Farm Advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.336" offset="264936">Farm Advantage counterclaimed with patent invalidity arguing that sexually reproducing plant such as hybrid corn plants at issue are not patenable subject matter under section 101 of tittle 35 of the U.S. Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.390" offset="337139">The District Court granted summary judgment to Pioneer and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.071" offset="359813">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we also affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.819" offset="378830">This Court has interpreted section 101’s subject matter terms broadly in Diamond versus Chakrabarty.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.697" offset="406311">In that case, we held that Section 101’s term manufacture or composition of matter include living things.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.833" offset="442882">The Board of Patent Appeals and Interference, subsequently held that plants are within the coverage of section 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.581" offset="485932">Farm Advantage argues however, that two more specific statutes the Plant Patent Act of 1930, the PPA and the Plant Variety Protection Act, the PVPA, foreclose utility patent protection for plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.037" offset="551761">Today we hold that these plants specific statutes do not diminish the breadth of the subject matter terms of Section 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.939" offset="587287">The PPA and the PVPA each have different requirements and scope of coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.996" offset="611529">Neither of these plants specific statutes conflicts with conferring utility patent protection to plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.741" offset="638487">As utility patents have more stringent requirements and generally more extensive protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.835" offset="666908">Moreover, we recognized that the Patent and Trademark Office has assigned over 1800 utility patents for new plant breeds in the last 16 years, and there has been no indication from either Congress or agencies with expertise that such coverage is inconsistent with the PPA or the PVPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.938" offset="751336">We decline to narrow the reach of Section 101 where congress has given us no indication that it intends this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.477" offset="781429">To do so it would be inconsistent with the forward-looking nature of the patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.373" offset="801073">Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Stevens has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.686" offset="834301">Justice O’Connor took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
