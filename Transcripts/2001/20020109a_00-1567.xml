            <text syncTime="3468.453" offset="14024400">Absolutely, and that's why I think it... it's extraordinary to think that Congress... Congress went to the steps that you would have to decide, if you decide this is not a collection period and akin to a statute of limitations, because prior to 1966, these tax claims, regardless of age, were all entitled to priority and were all nondischargeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.615" offset="14105066">And what Congress did in 1966 was decide it was going to balance competing interests within the bankruptcy process and condition the Government's entitlement to that special status on its diligent enforcement of those tax claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.164" offset="14155221">And that is why it's like a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.831" offset="14165984">But to hold otherwise is to say that what Congress went to in 1966 was a situation where everything was protected to where nothing is protected except at the sole discretion and choice of the debtor proceeding in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.851" offset="14218020">The Government will be left with no capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.897" offset="14226170">We can't choose our... we can't choose our debtors, and we will... and they have the entire authority to prevent any enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.139" offset="14255218">And we're not just talking about enforcement of claims that arose before they filed bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.125" offset="14271101">If you have bankruptcy proceedings that go on for more than 3 years, as many do, this... this rule would apply to tax claims that arose while the case was in bankruptcy and the 3 years ran.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.355" offset="14316031">And that in fact is what has happened in a case we have pending in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.798" offset="14329824">If they can discharge not just the things that you may have had a few months before... or a year before the bankruptcy was filed, tax claims that we have never had a millisecond outside the freedom of the automatic stay to enforce will be extinguished, not because of anything the Government did or did not do, but solely because of the procedural steps taken by the debtor in Bankruptcy Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.906" offset="14418222">And we think it's extraordinary to think that that's what Congress did and intended to do in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.684" offset="14441314">The... it went for that transformation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.708" offset="14449465">And statutes aren't to be construed to assume that Congress would imperil State or Federal revenues.</text>
