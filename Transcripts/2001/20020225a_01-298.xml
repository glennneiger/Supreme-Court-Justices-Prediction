            <text syncTime="25.058" offset="255014">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a State affirmatively invokes the jurisdiction of the Federal court by removing a case, that acts as a waiver of the State's forum immunity to Federal jurisdiction under the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.176" offset="311438">This principle has been confirmed as recently as this Court's decision in the College Savings Bank case where it was indicated that a State may waive Eleventh Amendment immunity by invoking Federal court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.693" offset="357518">This rule also finds support in a long line of decisions holding that where a State enters a Federal proceeding as an actor in any role, that effectively relinquishes any objections to Federal jurisdiction a State may have under the Eleventh Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="74.487" offset="452708">This Court's precedents seem to indicate that wherever the State is cast in the role of plaintiff, defendant, intervenor, or claimant, that the entry into the Federal proceeding submits the State to the jurisdiction of the Federal court.</text>

            <label>Mr. David J. Bederman</label>
            <text syncTime="89.536" offset="512895">Well, of course, the authorization requirement in Ford Motor... and that's the particular holding in Ford Motor that I think is of concern to this Court... need not be reached here because, of course, Ford Motor did not involve a case where a State was actually invoking Federal court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.282" offset="567856">So--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="104.397" offset="572349">So, you think a line can be drawn between the State defendant being drawn in as a respondent or involuntarily as opposed to removing and thereby invoking Federal jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="119.258" offset="631804">I think the key element here is precisely the invocation of Federal court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.594" offset="649149">And again, this... that's consistent with this Court's rulings in... in Gardner and in... and in Gunter and Clark where it's made clear that where the State actually is invoking Federal court jurisdiction, the proper inquiry is not the authority of the State officer or attorney to waive Eleventh Amendment immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.996" offset="726785">The proper inquiry is whether the State officer or attorney had the power to engage in the litigation conduct leading to the invocation of Federal court jurisdiction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="151.208" stopTime="155.208">
            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="151.208" offset="759595">In all... in all those cases, they were cases in which a State really consented to have litigated against it a Federal claim in a Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.176" offset="791464">And it's hardly surprising, once you agree to that, that you also are agreeing to have related things litigated against you.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.888" offset="826259">But this isn't that.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.291" offset="831902">This is a case where the only reason that the State went into the Federal court was so that the individual defendants would be able to invoke their right to have the matter heard in a Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.815" offset="874011">So, why isn't the obvious solution here... there are only State claims left against the State which doesn't want these heard in the Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.475" offset="912672">They haven't agreed to have anything heard there against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.895" offset="930331">So, judge, send it back to the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.905" offset="942348">What's it doing here?</text>
            <text syncTime="198.741" offset="949766">They don't want it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.127" offset="955304">Call that pendent jurisdiction, pendent claims, but it's an abuse of discretion, at least, not to send it back.</text>

            <text syncTime="206.276" offset="979859">If I may make a number of responses to your question, Justice Breyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.280" offset="995846">First of all, I believe this Court's holdings particularly in... in Richardson, in Gunter do present a situation where... where a State is entering the proceeding and... in the role of a defendant and later decides to regret that... that casting and tries to extricate itself from the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.599" offset="1073169">So, I think there is authority in this Court's precedents to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.450" offset="1084558">To your more general observation in terms of the harm here, in essence, weighing the plaintiff's interest in a single and unitary proceeding in State court, a result which has been the... this Court's jurisprudence construing 28 U.S.C. 1441(c) for almost a century that... that the removal statute does not entitle defendants to remove and then split up claims--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="257.341" stopTime="261.341">
            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="257.341" offset="1184137">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.017" offset="1186854">Well, that's exactly... what if it's that?</text>
            <text syncTime="259.403" offset="1192392">The interest of the plaintiff in having the action against the individuals in the State tried in one place, on the one hand, against the interest of the State having a State matter tried in State court where the State has refused to waive its immunity from Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.032" offset="1262922">That for me is easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.518" offset="1268878">One is a constitutional right; the other happens to be a right of a plaintiff that he wouldn't have anyway if he had brought his suit in Federal court, which is what removal jurisdiction is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.670" offset="1309420">So, why doesn't the State clearly prevail on that one?</text>

            <label>Mr. David J. Bederman</label>
            <text syncTime="292.097" offset="1323108">--Well, Justice Breyer, again with respect I think the... the proper analysis I think closely analyzing the State's professed interests in removing and claiming immunity was, first of all, to engage the expertise of Federal tribunals on questions arising under section 1983 and qualified immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.326" offset="1404088">Because you mentioned section 1983, and that makes this case terribly puzzling because I thought States were not persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.993" offset="1438779">So, if you're not subject to suit under 1983--</text>

            <text syncTime="432.077" offset="1883069">So, 1983 creates no remedy against a State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1920.921" offset="7838465">And the only thing the State is asking in this case is for the case to be treated as if it were originally filed in Federal court, which it is our belief is the true intent of the congressional removal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.347" offset="7888098">They didn't allow partial claims to be brought up, and the reason they didn't allow for it is because of the court's potential exercise of supplemental jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.719" offset="7925610">But in this case, there can be no exercise of supplemental jurisdiction simply because the legislature for the State of Georgia has not waived its sovereign immunity as to the Georgia Tort Claims Act for actions within the courts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.586" offset="7981094">So, in this case, by the exercise of a procedural device, the attorney general would not be only overriding the very principles established in the concepts of federalism, but would also be overriding the... the decisions of the State legislature and the Georgia constitution.</text>
