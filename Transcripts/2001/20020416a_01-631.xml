            <text syncTime="10.774" offset="192025">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has held in several decisions that the police questioning of individuals is a legitimate and, indeed, vital law enforcement technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.149" offset="245524">The decision below ignores this Court's teachings as to when a police-citizen encounter on a bus may violate the Fourth Amendment and may constitute the seizure of the passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.176" offset="305605">Police-citizen encounters have proven to be effective law enforcement techniques in the area of drug and weapon interdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.912" offset="348551">These encounters are also important in today's environment with respect to the protection of passengers in the Nation's public transportation system.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.724" offset="391809">This case is controlled by this Court's decision in Bostick and the court below incorrectly applied the Bostick test to these facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="73.356" offset="442382">Mr. Thompson, isn't it so that in Bostick the police did inform the passengers that they had a right to refuse consent?</text>

            <text syncTime="83.015" offset="480939">That is correct, Your Honor, but also in Bostick this Court clearly pointed out, on remand to the Florida Supreme Court, the factors that the Court should evaluate in terms of determining whether or not the encounter was coercive or otherwise inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.386" offset="554500">And two of those factors are important here that would put into context what the court below considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.702" offset="579682">For example, this Court pointed out to the Florida Supreme Court whether or not there were guns pointed and noted that there were no guns pointed in a... in the Bostick case.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.256" offset="617925">This Court also pointed out to the Florida Supreme Court that... whether or not there was the existence of threatening language, and none of that existed in the case below.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.899" offset="656482">Well, I... I suppose that the advice that you have a right to decline the request applies... and I... I take it you could read Bostick this way; perhaps you disagree... to whether or not the... the consent was actually given as opposed to whether there was a coercive environment.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.510" offset="750941">That's correct, Your Honor, and as the Bostick Court pointed out with respect to the test to be applied is whether or not, under all the circumstances, the police conduct communicated to a reasonable person... and that presupposes a reasonably... a reasonable innocent person... whether or not the passenger could have refused the officer's request to consent or otherwise have terminated the... terminated the encounter.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.113" offset="849370">There is really nothing remarkable about the facts of this case when you look at this Court's decision in Bostick and compare Bostick with this Court's decision in Robinette which clearly pointed--</text>

            <text syncTime="199.223" offset="945814">If we're applying a totality of the circumstances test, that's one circumstance that was present there, is not present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.147" offset="977475">So, whether the Eleventh Circuit erred is for us to determine today, but I do think it's a bit much to say that they... they just disregarded this Court's precedent.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.324" offset="1026271">--Your Honor, the Eleventh Circuit considered factors that were unlike the factors that this Court in Bostick believed were important in determining whether the police conduct at issue was coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.948" offset="1080711">And moreover, Your Honor, the Eleventh Circuit incorrectly applied the legal principles that this Court formulated with respect to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.895" offset="1120521">For example, the Eleventh Circuit noted the importance of Officer Hoover at the front of the bus and pointed out that his presence might lead a... a passenger to believe that he or she could not leave the bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.733" offset="1171826">Well, this Court in Bostick clearly pointed out that the... in a... in the context of a bus interdiction effort, whether or not the passenger could leave the bus was the wrong question.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.507" offset="1214980">The question was whether or not the passenger... whether or not the police conduct communicated to the passenger whether or not they could refuse the consent requested or whether or not they could just terminate the questioning of the police officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.017" offset="1265031">Well, it's... it's true that the... the issue of whether someone could leave the bus or not is... is not really an issue that... that focuses the question, and we said so in Bostick.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.881" offset="1304423">But it doesn't follow from that that it was irrelevant in Bostick or that it's irrelevant here that there was an officer stationed at the front of the bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.738" offset="1347891">If we're going to have a totality of the circumstances test, wouldn't you agree that that is one relevant fact to consider in trying to reconstruct the atmosphere and decide whether or not it signaled to the... to the person searched the... the possibility of just ending the encounter?</text>

            <text syncTime="318.974" offset="1424795">That... it is one relevant fact to be taken into consideration with the other factors, but here the officer stationed at the front of the bus... at the front of the bus really did not communicate, nor did Officer Lang who was doing the questioning... did not communicate that... to any passenger that he or she could not terminate the questioning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1542.098" offset="6317321">Rather, we think that Bostick got it entirely right with the language that advice is a factor particularly worth noting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1560.098" offset="6389315">Having thought long and hard, I think the key is that the Eleventh Circuit really was trying to give voice to the seizure or... and the consent test, as set out in Bostick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.647" offset="6439470">In Bostick at U.S. 437, the Court wrote... it focused on what the police conduct... conduct would have communicated to a reasonable person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.164" offset="6485550">And in Washington at 1357 and Guapi at 1395, what the Eleventh Circuit focused on... it said, it is enough that the circumstances themselves would indicate that the search can proceed only if consent is given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.569" offset="6543228">So, I believe that the Eleventh Circuit parallels Bostick's use of the word... that focused on what does it communicate with their use of the word indicate.</text>
