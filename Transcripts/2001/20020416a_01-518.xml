            <text syncTime="3381.575" offset="13673313">Once it found that the employer had lost the lawsuit, automatically according to the board, no merit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3392.266" offset="13716154">Then the board proceeds to the retaliatory motive step supposedly going to protect employers, and all they say is does it relate to union activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.811" offset="13750322">Well, if it relates, except for one case where it didn't, boom, you lose.</text>

            <text syncTime="3406.505" offset="13773101">And what the result of that is, is that no employer can go to court if any sort of protected activity is even arguably involved because even if you convene a panel of experts, as BE&amp;K did in this case, and go as far as you can to make sure you are not trampling on any employee rights, if you go to court, you will be found to have violated the law unless you can say with 100 percent certainty that you're going to win.</text>
