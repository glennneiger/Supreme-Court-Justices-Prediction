            <text syncTime="896.481" offset="3730327">Well, I think, Your Honor, if you look at the... at the district court's decision, which... excuse me... the State court decision, joint appendix 143, the State court makes very clear that it is in the process of making its decision reviewing... it calls it the health insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.207" offset="3829174">It's not really that... reviewing the terms of the plan and construing the terms of the plan for the purpose of determining what's the appropriate restitution, what's the appropriate reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.661" offset="3866999">Our position is the State court had no jurisdiction to do that unless they were doing so under a claim brought by the respondents under 502(a)(1)(B), in which case, of course, we could have removed that to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.945" offset="3924155">Not having done so, we also don't have a right to go into State court and ask the State court to construe that.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.414" offset="3954039">Now, one of the reasons why 502(a)(3) has to give us a right to enforce the terms of the plan is because we know the beneficiary has a right to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.042" offset="3988521">Under 502(a)(1)(B), it can go into State court or Federal court and enforce the terms of a plan, including to get benefits and money.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.959" offset="4024257">Second, we ought to be able to go into a Federal court and enforce the terms of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.243" offset="4045364">And the fact that we get money shouldn't preclude us from doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.027" offset="4056544">And finally, Congress requires us to go in and enforce the terms of a plan under 404.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.993" offset="4080368">And indeed, courts have uniformly said we're entitled to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.330" offset="4097713">For example... a very clear contract case... if an employer fails to make the contributions to a plan, where is the fiduciary going to get the authority to go and sue the employer?</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.219" offset="4145256">Under 502(a)(3)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.448" offset="4154137">That is where they go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.562" offset="4158630">So, there is no reason why... Congress clearly intended under 502(a)(3)(A), when you're enforcing the terms of a plan, unlike as in Mertens where you were not enforcing the terms of a plan, where you were not enforcing the terms of a specific provision of ERISA, here it is clear that we should be entitled to enforce the terms of a plan even if that means preserving... returning money to the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.349" offset="11737798">But if you look back at the original decisions that so held back in the 1960's, they all rested on something that is suggested directly by the language of title 7, which is not that back pay standing alone is equitable and therefore outside the jury trial right, but that equity always had the power to award money when incidental to and intertwined with traditional equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.619" offset="11834869">In... in the context of title 7, as in the context of the National Labor Relations Act on which title 7 was based, back pay enters not as a separately authorized remedy, but as reinstatement with or without back pay.</text>
