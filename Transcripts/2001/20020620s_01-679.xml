            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87750">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 01-0679 Gonzaga University versus John Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.102" offset="120142">John Doe, a respondent here studied elementary education at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.010" offset="147727">Before he graduated, he learned that Gonzaga disclosed false and defamatory allegations about him to officials of the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.331" offset="185030">He sued under State Court claiming tort and contract violations under state law and appending federal violation of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, the acronym for which is FERPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.837" offset="243022">The basis for the FERPA claim was section 1983 which provides a cause of action to enforce federal rights against state actors.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.279" offset="276772">A jury awarded him not only compensatory but punitive damages on both his state and federal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.779" offset="302790">Gonzaga appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.486" offset="309686">It argued that FERPA creates no federal rights and therefore cannot be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.102" offset="328077">The Washington Supreme Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.747" offset="338734">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the Washington Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.725" offset="358588">Section 1983 provides the means for enforcing individual rights that are secured by the constitution and laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.276" offset="396831">The question presented here is whether FERPA confers upon the respondent an individual right to be enforced under this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.438" offset="429432">We find that it confers no such right.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.325" offset="441030">We begin by noting that our opinions in this area suggested inconsistent standards for determining whether a federal statute is enforceable by 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.835" offset="479064">But we hold today that a federal statute is enforceable by section 1983 only if it clearly and ambiguously confers right upon a class of persons that includes the plaintiff bringing suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.705" offset="526503">This standard is the same as that used to determine whether a statute confers with federal rights in the context of suits brought against private parties under an implied right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.695" offset="570493">Both inquiries simply require courts to determine whether Congress unambiguously confer to federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.646" offset="598287">FERPA's confidentiality provisions clearly lack the sort of rights creating language critical to showing the required legislative intent to create new rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.771" offset="638829">Unlike the anti-discrimination provisions of Title VI and IX which focus directly on the individual to be protected and thus, confirm individual rights, FERPA merely instructs the Secretary of Education how to distribute federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.800" offset="698911">The operative language of the statute, for example, says no fund shall be made available to schools or institutions that have a policy of practice of disclosing private information.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.380" offset="749170">This language is far removed from the sort of language required to confer a new federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.942" offset="771427">Accordingly, we hold FERPA provides no basis for a private lawsuit brought under section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.517" offset="797758">Justice Breyer has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Souter joins; Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg joins.</text>
