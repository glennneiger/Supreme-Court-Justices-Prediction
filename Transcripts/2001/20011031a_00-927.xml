            <text syncTime="257.142" offset="1169887">First, to... to start at the... the beginning of your question, there are certain categories of vessels that are listed under the statute as inspected vessels and with respect... under Coast Guard statutes as inspected vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.253" offset="1238328">On those vessels, the Coast Guard inspects them at the beginning and then periodically for certification that they're in satisfactory condition, fit for the service for which they're intended and seaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.377" offset="1294857">The Coast Guard also has comprehensive regulatory authority over those vessels, and it's exercised that authority comprehensively over those vessels.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.380" offset="1458906">And the Coast Guard, on an inspected vessel, does not have that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.764" offset="1476356">Under the scheme, as it works, can OSHA regulate the... the kitchen knife problem, or... or is it completely displaced?</text>

            <text syncTime="342.556" offset="1511569">--It's completely displaced on the inspected vessels because the Coast Guard has comprehensive authority over those and has exercised its comprehensive authority on the inspected vessels by promulgating comprehensive regulations, and those regulations include specific ones addressing specific hazards, as well as general provisions such as the one that I was referring to that requires that the vessels be fit for the service that they're intended and safe and seaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.630" offset="1611879">And therefore, with respect to those, all the working conditions are covered either by the specifics or by the general, and the OSH Act does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.280" offset="1650436">But what we're concerned with in this case is a... is a vessel on which... over which the Coast Guard has much more limited authority and with respect to which it... it has authority to and has regulated only very specific conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="456.264" offset="1966413">And therefore, the Coast Guard regulation of working conditions on those vessels is spotty, depending on the statutory grants of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.154" offset="2005910">And as I said before, on... this particular type of inspected vessel is a... is an inland drilling barge, and on this barge there... the statutory authority doesn't give the Coast Guard authority to require fire extinguishers or... or those kind of things, and it gives the Coast Guard no authority over the hazards from oil and gas drilling, which are the hazards involved in this... in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3049.160" offset="12337965">That's in stark contrast to the Fifth Circuit's holding here that there's an industry-wide exemption for all seamen on all vessels from the OSH Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.171" offset="12377985">That's the approach that respondent endorses, admitting that regulation of the toilets would preempt regulation of the act altogether, and that you don't even need to regulate that, that... that the OSH Act simply doesn't apply because respondent mistakenly believes that the Coast Guard has authority, plenary authority, under section 2, when the Coast Guard has never interpreted section 2 to give it plenary authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.660" offset="12479967">And it's repeatedly gone back to Congress to get specific authority to address specific issues on particular uninspected vessels, and Congress has given the Coast Guard that authority, which indicates that neither Congress nor the Coast Guard thought section 2 gave it that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.455" offset="12535138">The... the Secretary's view that the Coast Guard has to regulate the particular working conditions at issue in order to displace the OSH Act is supported by the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.332" offset="12586651">It's supported by the purpose of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.515" offset="12595428">It's been the Secretary's longstanding view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.945" offset="12605146">It's been followed by all the other circuits except for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.256" offset="12618416">The Second Circuit, the Ninth Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit, with due respect to the maritime expertise in the Fifth Circuit, those circuits also have a great deal of maritime... of maritime expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.988" offset="12673273">And the working conditions here, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, are not maritime-specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.957" offset="12701172">They're matters over which OSHA has expertise, and 4(b)(1) allows the Coast Guard to step in and displace the OSH Act when it has authority and when it believes that its expertise warrants it to address the particular working conditions that are at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.177" offset="12766060">The Coast Guard doesn't have authority here.</text>
