            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87551">The second case that I have to announce this morning is No. 01-651 JP Morgan Chase Bank against Traffic Stream (BVI) Infrastructure Limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.584" offset="153798">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.239" offset="176472">By statute, the Federal Courts have jurisdiction over cases between citizens of State and citizens who are subjects of a foreign State.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.268" offset="212521">The respondent, Traffic Stream, is a corporation organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, which is an overseas territory under the political authority of the United Kingdom.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.922" offset="255153">After Traffic Stream and a New York corporation the petitioner, JP Morgan Chase Bank, became embroiled in a contract dispute, Chase attempted to sue Traffic Stream in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.139" offset="308024">The Second Circuit held it because Traffic Stream is a corporation of the British Virgin Islands, and the islands are not recognized as an independent country, jurisdiction would not lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.918" offset="355149">In a unanimous opinion filed today with the Clerk of the Court, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.763" offset="374584">Both the jurisdictional statute and the constitutional provision allowing alienage jurisdiction were intended to insure foreign as a neutral forum for dispute resolutin.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.258" offset="424531">In this way, the United States could provide incentives for foreign investment and avoid angering foreign governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.142" offset="452116">Given the pervasive authority exercised by the United Kingdom over the British Virgin Islands, these purposes of alienage jurisdiction must serve by treating the British Virgin Islandsâ€™ corporations, as citizens who are subjects of the United Kingdom.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.149" offset="512093">It does not matter that United Kingdom law may provide fewer rights to residents of the British Virgin Islands than it does to other United Kingdom subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.992" offset="547515">It is our own law that we consult in determining whether a corporation will have access to our courts, and it is beyond dispute to the nationals of a foreign state, whatever their status in their home country, might be treated as citizens or subjects of that state for purposes of federal jurisdiction.</text>
