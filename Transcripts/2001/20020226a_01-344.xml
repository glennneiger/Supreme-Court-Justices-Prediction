            <text syncTime="7.430" offset="177633">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It has long been a fundamental requirement of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that a new drug may not be marketed unless it has first been found by the Food and Drug Administration to be safe and effective for its intended use.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.034" offset="240014">Congress concluded that the protection of the public health requires that safety and effectiveness be rigorously established by scientifically valid studies rather than the impressions of individual doctors, and also that persons who promote and distribute new drugs should be the ones to undertake the studies necessary to establish their safety effectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.037" offset="328098">In 1997, Congress carved out a narrow exception to the new drug approval and certain other requirements of the Food and Drug Act for certain compounding by pharmacists.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.728" offset="370835">The exemption is addressed to what is often referred to as extemporaneous compounding.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.641" offset="390479">That is, compounding undertaken in response to a physician's prescription based on the idiosyncratic needs of a particular patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.557" offset="426110">Such compounding is typically based on an existing relationship among the pharmacist, physician, and patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.616" offset="454322">Congress provided in section 353(a), which it enacted in 1997, that the exemptions from the new drug approval and other requirements of the act would be limited, and available only in circumstances that conformed to extemporaneous compounding by pharmacists.</text>

One answer is, don't advertise, because we know what that may lead to, and the other answer is, a restriction on volume that pharmacies can write, or can produce.</text>

            <text syncTime="3165.527" offset="12810031">It would have to be done by licensed pharmacists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.468" offset="12817764">These were all the conduct-specific related regulations that one would applaud, that Congress has a right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.239" offset="12844827">But to try to reduce the demand, and try to keep truthful information by restrictions on First Amendment is, this is what's offensive about that part of FDAMA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.089" offset="12880249">We didn't seek to have the conduct-related provisions stricken, and in fact it was the Government that it, itself put it in, then went to the Ninth Circuit and said, well, we can't have the First Amendment restriction, we don't want the others, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.853" offset="12955272">I also want to point out that when it comes to manufacturing, manufacturing, going back to Justice Ginsburg's question, we sell it retail, they sell it wholesale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.224" offset="12992784">We sell pursuant to a prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.743" offset="12998845">They sell just to a middle man distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.797" offset="13015145">We provide consultation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.654" offset="13022564">There is no consultation when it comes to a manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.824" offset="13039178">There's also, on this issue of widespreadedness, the degree, or the volume concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.116" offset="13092363">First of all, we can only dispense, and we routinely only prepare upon receipt of a pharmacist's... of a physician's prescription, but in addition to that, if volume were such a concern, there was unlimited intrastate transportation allowed, dispensing of pharmaceuticals, so I seriously question, for example, whether or not they even... FDAMA even addressed adequately the volumes, the volume restrictions it was trying to impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.754" offset="13210959">Also, for example, positron emissions compounding, and radiopharmaceutical compounding were exempted from the operation of FDAMA, so that potentially the most lethal, most dangerous of all the compounds could be advertised, promoted, solicited, and no pharmacopeia ingredients could have been used for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.035" offset="13288072">They also provided for industry transportation in the event of a memorandum of understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.525" offset="13310015">Up to 20 percent of the total pharmaceutical sales by that pharmacy could be shipped intrastate, so that if, for example, there were five compounding pharmacists in a State, they could fill 100 percent of the outside... of the out-of-State demand, so at the end of the day, as in Greater New Orleans, this case... I'm sorry, this statute was so riddled with exemptions... with exceptions that undermined the Government's own very purpose, that it would fail just because it was simply irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.104" offset="13436343">As the Court pointed out already, it is irrational to suggest that only speech that's provoked by the physician can be unregulated, whereas the same speech in the context of a professional relationship as provoked by the pharmacist, then somehow it becomes unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.627" offset="13514397">In the lower court we pointed out the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.766" offset="13526936">That means under this statute a pharmacist would have to have a little sign on his counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.984" offset="13547834">On this little sign it would say, please ask me to tell you what I think you should know, but because of FDAMA, I, under restrictions on advertising, promotion, solicitation, am forbidden from telling you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.971" offset="13599765">If there are no further questions, I shall conclude.</text>

            <text syncTime="3368.460" offset="13621708">Mr. Chief Justice, what Congress was trying to do here was to make sure that the narrow exemption that it intended did not swallow the critical general rule that new drugs have to be submitted to prior approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.123" offset="13676356">The question of volume limitations has been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.634" offset="13690462">The act contains an aggregate volume limitation but, as I mentioned, individual drug-by-drug volume limitations would be very difficult to administer, and Congress was not required to go down that path, but an additional point about that is that if you look... if you add up a couple of prescriptions by each pharmacy, Nation-wide you will be talking about a pretty large volume of a new drug, which is precisely the sort of thing that should be submitted to the FDA for prior approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.674" offset="13814596">The act does not just prohibit manufacturing new drugs, it prohibits the introduction in interstate commerce of new drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.073" offset="13840196">It isn't just focused on large volumes, it's focused on individual instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.888" offset="13855452">So are the misbranding and adulteration provisions of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.823" offset="13875200">The line Congress drew here that includes solicitation and advertising among the conditions was not invented in 1997.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.368" offset="13909369">In case law it goes all the way back to 1978 in the Cedars case we mentioned in the brief, where the Court there was trying to define the scope of the express exemption for pharmacy in registration and inspections, and among the factors it says when someone steps out of the traditional pharmacy role was, do they engage in promotion of the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.596" offset="13990244">The definition also appears in the Model Rules of Good Pharmacy Practice of the State of the National Association of State Boards of Pharmacy, which says that pharmacists should not solicit or advertise compounded drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.828" offset="14051266">All of this represents a general understanding that compounding by pharmacists has to be contemporaneous and responsive--</text>
