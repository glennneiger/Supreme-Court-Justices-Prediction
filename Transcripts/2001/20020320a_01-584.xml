            <text syncTime="3387.841" offset="13697149">The difference is the absence of the words otherwise prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.608" offset="13708225">The same words that did not exist in F 2 when Betts was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.900" offset="13725465">Without the words otherwise prohibited, there would be a good argument that the reasonable factors defense was not a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.042" offset="13753991">But because of those two critical words, it is inescapable that there has already been a violation of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.903" offset="13777397">Second, Fogerty was a copyright case, not another discrimination case in trying to import the attorneys fee provision, prevailing party fee provision in that case did not make sense as it does here because the ADEA in Title VII share a common purpose and the common legislative history and the common language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.305" offset="13855033">In Gunther, the court did not hold that there was not disparate impact for a wage disparities under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.510" offset="13891813">What the court held was that the defense was any other factor and that that applied or suggested that it might apply in a facially neutral practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.981" offset="13929743">But the court also said in Gunther that the, that the Defendant, improving its defense, must establish that factors were legitimate and bonafide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.655" offset="13972479">Here, of course, we have the additional word reasonable so mere legitimacy, or merely being bonafide cannot be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.911" offset="14005498">While the, as counsel conceded in mixed motive cases, the court's analysis is whether or not but-for, the but-for analysis must be connected and whether or not the employer's motives caused the employer's action is at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.974" offset="14121691">And again, going back to the words otherwise prohibited, we don't have that under the reasonable factors defense for the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.550" offset="14123989">I have no more to offer.</text>
