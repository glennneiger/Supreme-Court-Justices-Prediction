            <text syncTime="281.657" offset="1264502">First, the... if you look back at this Court's Federal tariff cases you find that the reason these cases wound up in Federal court, even though lower courts in the cases have almost routinely said this looks to us like a run-of-the-mill state contract issue, is because the tariff itself derives its authority and depends entirely upon the Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.920" offset="1365544">That's what makes them Federal statutes, because of the Federal Government's interest in the whole process.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark L. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="316.208" offset="1402637">Jackson Transit actually was a case involving a contract under the Urban Mass Transit Act in which the Court's analysis proceeded as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.847" offset="1449240">First, it said these are inherently, pervasively Federal contracts... e agree with that... and but for a contrary indication in the text of the statute or the legislative history we would view those as Federal issues that belong in Federal court, but the Court went on to look first at the text where they found the issue not conclusive, and then to the legislative history where it found that Congress made a specific determination that it did not want these cases in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.940" offset="1569612">There is no such analogy in the case here, and in fact, if anything, the suggestion is to the contrary, because when Congress did address the question of jurisdiction, albeit it perhaps in narrower terms than we would have liked.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.564" offset="1624051">It made clear that the... that there's jurisdiction in the Federal courts and that, moreover, State courts are foreclosed from involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.460" offset="1667728">It's odd to imagine why an issue like the one in this case which could just as well have come up at the approval stage, but didn't until the interpretation stage, in part because the Internet exploded in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.515" offset="1715898">In one case it goes to Federal court, in the other case it goes to State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.973" offset="1733766">It just doesn't... it doesn't make sense that Congress would have envisioned that outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.484" offset="1747767">There has been discussion about whether 252(e)(6) in some way restricts the provisions of... excuse me, the availability of jurisdiction under section 1331, and we think the answer to that is quite clear not only from the general presumption against that kind of restriction that the Court has articulated from time to time, but also because in this statute Congress actually enacted a specific rule of construction in section 601(c) of the act which is actually not in the joint appendix and not codified.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.122" offset="1902308">It appears as a... in the note to 47 U.S.C. 152, and what it said there was that nothing in the act should be construed to modify, impair, or supersede Federal law unless expressly so provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.187" offset="1962598">So Congress spoke to what inferences could be drawn from a limitation of jurisdiction in 252(e)(6) and, moreover, there... the Court has... I mean, the Congress has shown repeatedly, both in this statute and in other statutes, that when it wishes to preclude review in one court system or another it spells that out specifically, as it does in 252(e)(4) here with respects to States, as it's done in a variety of statutes that we and the Government have cited in our briefs with respect to the other... with respect to the medicare act.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.853" offset="2105227">And finally, let me just say a word about the impracticality of the bifurcation that I think Mr. Smith is striving for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.141" offset="2142425">It would mean a bizarre separation where a case could come up with an interpretation not only of... not only of the issues we think are binding as a matter of Federal law, but also State law issues that the State put in as part of its review, and from Mr. Smith's point of view, if it's interpretive, it all goes right to State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.380" offset="2235317">In our view, at least all of the Federal issues come to Federal court, and probably the State issues can come along under supplementary jurisdiction, although there may be a... may not be possible to name the State in that context.</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.964" offset="6933700">Essentially, the FCC issued an order saying that ISP calls to ISP's were largely interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.699" offset="6964629">That order also said, for those companies that had already approved agreements, the State commission was to look at contract principles to see if the parties should be bound by their previous agreements, and whether their previous agreements should be interpreted to include calls to ISP's being local.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.516" offset="7035891">That's what the Maryland commission did in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.745" offset="7044773">Verizon appealed to Federal district court raising two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.203" offset="7062641">The first issue was that, under Maryland contract law, the commission had misinterpreted the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.362" offset="7091271">That's the first issue that they raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.574" offset="7100153">That was clear from their motion for summary judgment, which is part of the record of the case, but I don't believe it's included in any appendix to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.254" offset="7130873">The second issue they raised is, after the commission had interpreted the contract principles, the commission determined that the FCC order required them to develop an intercarrier compensation mechanism until such time as the FCC had developed its own compensation mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.004" offset="7201821">Now, what Verizon said was that the commission was wrong, that the FCC didn't require that, that they made it discretionary for the commission, and those were the only two issued raised by Verizon in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2573.481" offset="10431810">So in this instance I believe the petitioners are wrong in their analysis that you have 1331 jurisdiction unless Congress specifically precludes 1331 jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.091" offset="10490220">The only cases that has occurred has been with regard to Federal agencies, as I mentioned earlier, and that was because to find that 1331 wasn't broad enough to encompass a Federal agency would mean that there would be absolutely no review, so I think that there is a distinction that is important between the two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.060" offset="10558033">The final reason the Fourth Circuit found that the 1331 claim should be dismissed was the Rooker-Feldman doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.469" offset="10595754">Under that doctrine, it involves essentially a statutory interpretation element and a federalism element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.014" offset="10629922">The statutory interpretation element is that 1257 grants original jurisdiction to this Court and this Court alone over State... I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.243" offset="10674853">1257 alone grants this Court appellate review of State court decisions, and that the Federal district courts only have review over original actions, original civil actions, and that by implication, therefore, Federal district courts have no review over State court actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2677.522" offset="10847888">I think that's distinguishable because in the case you referred to the district court already had jurisdiction over Federal claims that were totally separate and apart from the on-record administrative review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.624" offset="10904313">Essentially, the Federal claims could have been brought without actually reviewing the record and the order in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.940" offset="10929599">It was because the Federal district court already had that jurisdiction over those claims that this Court found it could exercise its supplemental jurisdiction and also hear those claims that involved the on-the-record State court... actually, I think it was actually a local administrative agency in that case, but the on-the-record review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.463" offset="11007653">So I think this is different in that Verizon raises no claims that are separate and apart from the on-the-record review and decisions of the Maryland Public Service Commission, so in this instance the Federal district court will be acting as an appellate court, particularly since I believe virtually every Federal district court that has considered the issue has said in telecommunications cases it's not a de novo review, it is an on-the-record review, so in this instance they will be performing an appellate action rather than an original civil action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2927.083" offset="11846184">I would just like to read two provisions, very short provisions from the contract that's being interpreted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.913" offset="11901459">The first says, reciprocal compensation is as described in the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.121" offset="11918282">The second says, as described in the act means, as described in or required by the act, meaning the '96 telecom act, and as from time to time interpreted in the duly authorized rules and regulations of the FCC or the State commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.437" offset="11979617">Now, if you look at the decision of the agency here, the State agency here, it is full of a discussion of what it means, what reciprocal compensation is required under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.061" offset="12034056">That was the basis for the interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.752" offset="12040848">The effect of the interpretation was to say, even though the act doesn't require it, you have to provide it, because your agreement says you're going to provide it, and we... this statement says just the opposite.</text>
