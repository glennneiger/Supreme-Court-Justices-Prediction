            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87445">The opinion of the Court No. 00-1073 Owasso Independent School District versus Falvo will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="9.731" stopTime="307.383">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="9.731" offset="126315">The respondent’s children are enrolled in the Owasso School District which is in a suburb of Tulsa, Oklahoma and the teachers there sometimes asked the students to score each other’s papers and assignments as the teacher explains the correct answers to the entire class and this is called peer grading where the students grade each other’s papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.292" offset="220565">Now, the respondent, the parents, claim that peer grading violates a Federal Statute which is called the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the Act is sometimes referred to as FERPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.915" offset="279079">Asserting the violation of the Act, the parents filed a 1983 Action against the School District and other school officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.647" offset="310008">The Act authorizes federal funds to be withheld from school district that permits student’s education records or the information contain in the record to be released without the parent’s written consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.344" offset="360790">At the offset we note that as an open question whether the Act provides Private Parties like these parents with a cause of action enforceable in the 1983 and we have granted certiorari on this issue in another case which we will hear later this term.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.239" offset="428395">For purposes of the present case, the court assumes without deciding that FERPA provides private parties like the parents with a cause of action enforceable under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.315" offset="472699">The question now is do they prevail in saying that this peer grading mechanisms are a violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.661" offset="514077">The School District and the United States contain that education records include only institutional records like student grade point, averages, standardized test scores, and the records of disciplinary actions, but the parents adapting the Tenth Circuit reasoning contend the teachers grade books and the grades within are maintained by the teacher, and thus covered by the Act and the Court of Appeals reasoned that if the teacher cannot disclose the grades once they are written in the grade book it makes no sense to permit the disclosure immediately beforehand.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.253" offset="648451">So the court thus held and the parents agree that student graders maintain the grades under the Act until they are reported to the teacher so they cannot be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.899" offset="687007">Two statutory indicators show that the Tenth Circuit aired:  first, student papers are maintained by the student graders in their view and we conclude that this is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.652" offset="737998">The word "maintain" suggests FERPA records will be kept in a filing cabinet in a records room at the school or in a permanent secured database.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.281" offset="768509">Perhaps even after the student is no longer enrolled, the student graders only handle assignments for a few minutes as the teacher calls out the answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.684" offset="802155">Second, a student grader is not a person acting for an educational institution, that phrase connotes agents of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.917" offset="835069">Just as it would be awkward to say students are acting for the institution when they follow their teacher’s instruction to take a quiz, it is equally awkward to say that they are acting for the institution when following their teacher’s directions to score the paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.770" offset="898495">Correcting a classmate’s work can be as much a part of the assignment as taking the test itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.341" offset="920751">It is a way to teach material again in a new context and it helps show students how to assist and respect fellow pupils.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.054" offset="947605">By explaining the answers of the class as the students correct the papers, the teacher not only reinforces the lesson but also discovers whether the students have understood the material and are ready to move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.639" offset="989923">We do not think FERPA prohibits these educational techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.273" offset="1004447">Respondent’s construction of the term education records to cover student homework or classroom work would impose substantial burdens on teachers across the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.010" offset="1039452">It would force all instructors to take time which otherwise could be spent teaching and in preparation to correct an assortment of daily student assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.532" offset="1073515">Respondent’s view would make it much more difficult for teachers to give the students immediate guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.027" offset="1099533">Indeed, the logical consequences of the respondents, arguments are all but unbounded at oral argument counsel for the respondents seem to agree that if a teacher in any of the thousands of classrooms in the nation covered by this act puts a happy face or a gold star or disapproving remark on a classroom assignment, Federal Law does not allow other students to see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.517" offset="1201411">With that Congress meant to intervene in this drastic fashion which traditional state functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.896" offset="1222936">Under the Court of Appeals’ interpretation of FERPA the federal power would exercise minute control over specific teaching methods and instruction on dynamics and classrooms throughout this country, the Congress does not likely to have mandated this result and we do not interpret the stature to require it.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.980" offset="1287301">The Tenth Circuit's decision is reversed and remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.311" offset="1300676">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
