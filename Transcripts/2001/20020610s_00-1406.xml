            <text syncTime="5.969" offset="111606">The first of two cases I have to announce this morning is number 00-1406 Chevron USA Inc against Echazabal.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.399" offset="161343">The case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.738" offset="182659">The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the ADA prohibits employers from adapting job qualifications that screen or tend to screen out individuals with disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.603" offset="238143">The Act provides employers with an affirmative defense however.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.776" offset="254861">The job qualifications that are shown to be job related inconsistent with business necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.905" offset="283387">The statute says that these job qualifications may include a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.662" offset="334378">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has gone one step further.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.915" offset="351410">With a regulation extending the direct threat defense to risks that the job may pose to the disabled workers own health or safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.722" offset="390593">Beginning in 1972, the respondent Mario Echazabal worked for independent contractors at one of the petitioners Chevron USA's oil refineries.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.098" offset="436151">In 1995 Echazabal applied for a job directly with Chevron but Chevron refused to hire him because of the liver condition he had which Chevron's doctors said would be aggravated by continued exposure to toxins at the refinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.626" offset="498218">Chevron further asked Echazabalâ€™s contractor to reassign him or if necessary as it is proved today to remove him from the refinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.809" offset="538969">Echazabal filed suit claiming that Chevron's refusal to hire him or even to let him continue on in the plant was discrimination because of his disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.873" offset="579198">Chevron defended under the EEOC's regulation permitting an employer not to hire someone whose performance of the job would pose a direct threat to his own health.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.354" offset="621098">The District Court granted summary judgment for Chevron; the Court of Appeals reversed holding that the so-called threat to self-defense exceeded the scope of permissible rule making allowed by the ADA.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.623" offset="674179">In the unanimous opinion filed today were the Clerk of the Court we reverse and remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.056" offset="695913">The EOOC'd regulation is entitled the deference so long as the ADA does not unambiguously precluded and the regulation is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.485" offset="729663">We find both conditions to be met in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.680" offset="746486">Although the statute goes out of its way to tell employers that they need not hire workers who would pose threats to other individuals in the workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.454" offset="781594">This does not close the door to other valid qualification standards that the employer may adapt.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.021" offset="807821">For example would a meat packer who refuse to hire typhoid Mary be defenseless simply because she posed a risk to others outside the workplace but not clearly within.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.337" offset="857036">The question shows that little can be read by way of negative implication from Congress's specification of a defense to threat pose to others in the workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.094" offset="896115">We further find the EEOC's regulations to be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.829" offset="911057">By requiring that employers who seek to a certain threat to self defense do so, only after an individualized medical assessment of the risk of the employers will face on the job, the regulations strikes an adequate balance between advancing workplace safety without fostering workplace paternalism.</text>
