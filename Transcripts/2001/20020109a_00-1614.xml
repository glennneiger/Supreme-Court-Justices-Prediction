            <text syncTime="16.884" offset="219107">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 25 years ago in United Air Lines v. Evans, this Court observed that an employer was entitled to treat a past act as lawful after respondent failed to file a timely charge of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.437" offset="285354">In the Court's words... and I quote... a discriminatory act, which has not made the basis for a timely charge, is the legal equivalent of a discriminatory act which occurred before the statute was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.068" offset="335823">The Court further referred to the alleged discriminatory act outside the limitations period as merely an unfortunate event in history which has no present legal consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.182" offset="376260">In the present case, Abner Morgan challenges as discriminatory various acts that he did not make the basis for an EEOC charge within 300 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.213" offset="416384">Our contention is that Amtrak was entitled to treat those past acts as lawful after the passage of 300 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.811" offset="446791">Those acts are merely unfortunate events in history with no present legal consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.762" offset="466644">The Ninth Circuit saw things quite differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.106" offset="480018">According to the Ninth Circuit, all plaintiffs, completely without regard to their own diligence, may base suit on events they didn't make the basis of a timely charge, as long as those events are sufficiently related to later events that can also be characterized as discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3521.744" offset="14238503">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.726" offset="14254490">Justice O'Connor, in one of her questions for Ms. Price, referred to the very lopsided split in the circuits, and I agree that there's a very lopsided split contrary to the Ninth Circuit's view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.748" offset="14290539">Only one of those many circuit cases that I'm aware of... at least the recent circuit cases... actually discusses the 706(g) issue that's taken up much of the argument time today, and that is the First Circuit's opinion in Sabree, which actually comes out squarely where we come out in this case, that in general damages are cut off at 300 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.861" offset="14367026">There is an exception, the details of which it's probably better not to spend any more time on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.948" offset="14383326">But we agree with the Sabree result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.805" offset="14390745">Under no circumstances does our view render section 706(g) superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.948" offset="14419375">I do think it's something of an anachronism enacted to deal with problems that went away, but under no circumstances is it superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.129" offset="14448110">In cases of equitable tolling, in government suits against municipalities under section 707 where there is no statute of limitations, in the kinds of hostile environment cases we were discussing earlier, the 2-year back pay cap can have effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.361" offset="14509027">Let me mention very briefly, although not much time was spent on it earlier, the Havens case was decided under a different statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.957" offset="14539434">In the Lorance case, the Solicitor General urged the Court to follow Havens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.500" offset="14557511">The Court said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.357" offset="14565034">The Court didn't address Havens in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.215" offset="14572453">It said... but it said... did say in its opinion the more relevant precedents are the NLRA precedents, which squarely support the position we're taking here today.</text>

            <text syncTime="3621.206" offset="14636400">I think they might concede less than I was conceding earlier, but other than that, I think there's very little difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.853" offset="14655000">And the Government, quite importantly, in its brief says what the continuing violation doctrine is, and what the continuing violation doctrine is in all other areas of law besides title VII is essentially what some of Justice Scalia's questions were suggesting, which is you're not out of court entirely just because you didn't bring suit within 300 days of the first incident or 4 years in the case of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.939" offset="14743294">You do get to bring suit, but you only get damages reaching back to the limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.262" offset="14764609">Let me mention very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.757" offset="14774536">Amtrak did win this case at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.449" offset="14781328">So, I don't want the Court to have the impression that it's conceded that there was racial discrimination going on, but I'll leave it at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.188" offset="14804316">And finally, just a detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.112" offset="14812048">43 States and the District of Columbia more or less are deferral States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.164" offset="14832214">That's the figure the Government has given me, and I'm... I'm certain it's more than 40 States are deferral States.</text>
