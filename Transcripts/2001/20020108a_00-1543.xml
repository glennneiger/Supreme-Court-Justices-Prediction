            <text syncTime="10.774" offset="188663">I hope I got that right. [Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="12.632" offset="196082">Mr. Bork.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="15.232" offset="206531">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: I refer to them as SMC. [Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="20.145" offset="226175">The Federal circuit's rules in this case ought to be reversed because it flatly contradicts this Court's decision in Warner-Jenkinson, and furthermore, it radically undermines the patent system.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.541" offset="271732">I think Warner-Jenkinson should be reaffirmed because it's in keeping with the Patent Act, with the goals and policies of the patent system, and because it is much fairer than the harsh inequities of this new rule which this case presents a prime example.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.464" offset="339442">Warner... let me discuss the crucial differences between Warner-Jenkinson and the Federal circuit's new rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.522" offset="367654">In the first place, Warner-Jenkinson holds that prosecution history estoppel arises only when an amendment to a patent surrenders subject matter... and clearly surrenders it... in order to achieve patentability.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.672" offset="428258">The Federal circuit holds to the contrary that any narrowing amendment, regardless of the reason for it, creates prosecution history estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.331" offset="466919">Second, the Warner-Jenkinson case holds that the reason for an amendment determines whether an estoppel is created.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.672" offset="500251">The Federal circuit denies that and holds that the reason is irrelevant, and if an amendment has the narrowing effect, intended or not, it creates a complete estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.643" offset="548108">Thus, if the patent examiner said he found the claims to be imprecise and the applicant made an amendment to clarify what the examiner thought was imprecise, that might be held to be a narrowing amendment and the patent would be unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.969" offset="621460">And that is what happened to Festo in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.115" offset="630028">And those results cannot be squared with Warner-Jenkinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.830" offset="644865">Third, the Federal circuit holds that an amendment creates an estoppel if it applies to any of the statutory requirements for obtaining a patent, not just patent... not just patentability as defined by the Patent Act, but any of the requirements for obtaining a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.243" offset="726576">Now, the Patent Act makes clear a distinction between patentability and other requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.951" offset="753326">Sections 101 through 103 come under the heading of patentability of inventions, and they state the substantive requirements for getting a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.097" offset="797943">The invention must be new and useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.576" offset="807869">It must be not found in the prior art, and it must not be obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.784" offset="824692">Those are the only elements of patentability known in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.326" offset="842873">And this Court's opinion in Graham against John Deere confirms that.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.238" offset="862517">No other requirement of the statute relates to patentability.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.614" offset="879967">The Federal circuit holds to the contrary, that an amendment affecting any of the statutory requirements for getting a patent may generate estoppel, and those requirements include sections 111 and 112 of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.929" offset="941303">But those sections relate to the form of the application and not to the subject matter sought to be patented.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="207.102" offset="974008">Is it clear most of the time, Mr. Bork, whether the amendment is for purposes of 103, 111, and 112?</text>
            <text syncTime="214.244" offset="1002534">Can you pick up the patent history and... and tell at a glance whether it's a 103 or a 111 and 112 purpose that generated the amendment?</text>

            <text syncTime="222.668" offset="1036284">I think one can.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.532" offset="1039732">For example, in this case you'll see in the Stoll patent... there are two patents, of course, in play here, the Stoll patent and the Carroll patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.130" offset="1070034">In this case, the patent examiner says that he objects on the grounds that the claim is stated in an improper form, is multiply dependent, and also that it's imprecise.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.034" offset="1117682">He's not sure what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.254" offset="1122593">Now, that is quite clear that those are 111 and 112 objections, not to the subject matter sought to be patented.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.594" offset="1155925">But if you're the applicant and you get that response from the Patent Office, during the course of the amendment might you not rethink and... and clarify what you're doing under 103 as well?</text>
            <text syncTime="264.195" offset="1202318">That's what--</text>

            <text syncTime="264.854" offset="1204931">Oh, if the... if the applicant decides to amend in a way that surrenders subject matter, it disclaims subject matter, the fact that the process began with a... with the examiner's on grounds of form doesn't affect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.892" offset="1277133">If he surrenders subject matter, that subject matter is gone and the equivalents to it are gone too.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.492" offset="1323526">There was an argument to that effect, but if you look at the patent... at the prosecution history which is of both the Stoll and the Carroll patents, which are in the volume 2 of the transcript, there is no abandonment of any subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.353" offset="1382981">In the Stoll patent, there is no abandonment of subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.852" offset="1408999">In the Carroll patent, there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.444" offset="1415373">However, the subject matter which was abandoned had no relevance to the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.842" offset="1440973">It wasn't what was... what was sued on, so that there is, in operational terms, no disclaimer or surrender of subject matter in either of these patents.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.877" offset="1497084">Mr. Bork, both the Solicitor General and an amicus, the IEEE, suggest that a... a different flexible bar test would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.821" offset="1556852">Would you comment on those two proposals?</text>

            <text syncTime="355.960" offset="1569391">Justice O'Connor, I think they're much too narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.932" offset="1581303">The only rationale that makes any sense as to a flexible bar proposal or any bar proposal is that if you've disclaimed something, then the equivalent of subject matter... the equivalents to the disclaimed subject matter are barred by estoppel, but other equivalents that don't go to what was surrendered are not barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.105" offset="1686002">Therefore, the... the rule of the... the bar, the question of the scope of the bar, relates closely to the question... the first question presented in this case--</text>

            <text syncTime="414.100" offset="1801985">If it's unclear what... why you have done it, then this Court in Warner-Jenkinson says there be a remand under a presumption that what you did was for purposes of patentability, what you surrendered was for purposes of patentability, and if you cannot rebut that presumption, then you lose.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.204" offset="1946390">It said the Court should presume that the patent application has a substantial reason relating to patentability.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.922" offset="1977215">And then the following sentence is, in those circumstances, prosecution history estoppel would bar the application of the doctrine of equivalents.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.811" offset="2024757">So, that sounds to me like an absolute bar rule, that if you don't... if the reason is unexplained, the consequence is a complete bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.450" offset="2107409">If the appellate court, this Court, looks and says, I don't know the reason... as in Warner-Jenkinson, it was unclear why there was a lower limit of pH 6 set on that process... I don't know... I don't know why you amended to set that lower limit, there is a presumption that you did it for a reason related to patentability, which would create a complete bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.480" offset="2219526">However, on remand, you get a chance to rebut that presumption with evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1397.890" offset="5737071">We did say that amendments made to avoid prior art and amendments made for other purposes relating to securing the patent present different problems because amendments made to avoid prior art are almost always narrowing amendments, and we think that the Federal circuit, in speaking of narrowing amendments, really was speaking of surrendering subject matter which is the formulation that the petitioner prefers; whereas, amendments made for other purposes have to be scrutinized with particular care because they often are not narrowing amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.274" offset="5946677">And indeed, in some of the post-Festo decisions of the Federal circuit, the court has held that there was... it was not a narrowing amendment and therefore there's no bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.080" offset="5993907">But they can be narrowing amendments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1508.435" offset="6179272">If there was an addition of a limitation on the pH levels from 6 to 9 in the amendment, if the examiner in that case had said that the specifications are not clear enough and that amendment was added in response to that, even though the examiner had raised other concerns, but the applicant purported to add that limitation in response to the examiner's concerns about the specificity, it still would be adding a limitation and it would be an implied disclaimer of subject matter in comparison with the initial claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1588.518" offset="6499637">When he started off... the applicant started off without this limitation and then added the limitation, the limitation speaks for itself in narrowing the scope of the claim elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.023" offset="6557629">And that... that is the central problem of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.117" offset="6582080">If prosecution history estoppel is to have meaningful effect, once we settle where it applies, which seems to me to be the lesser question, it necessarily follows, if it's to have meaningful effect, that the claim elements that have been narrowed by the patent applicant, in order to secure the issuance of the patent, cannot be afforded the same or almost the same protection against non-literal infringement that would be available to them under the doctrine of equivalents if they had not been narrowed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1686.682" offset="6892310">Prosecution history estoppel and its effects are really equitable in origin, and the courts have the authority to reexamine the application of equitable doctrines in light of experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.852" offset="6944973">The... the real question here, as we see it, is what... how do you reconcile the inferences that are legitimately to be drawn by the public with the patentholder's need for protection from unfair copying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.320" offset="7010802">And this is not a matter of small moment because if... the doctrine of equivalents does not apply, but the all-elements test still is applicable, as the opinions below reflect, to claims of literal infringement or non-literal infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.837" offset="7092931">So, we have suggested an answer that we draw directly from this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.042" offset="7129711">We first look at Exhibit Supply, a 1942 decision, in which the Court said that when the applicant narrows the claim, he necessarily is recognizing the difference between what was originally acclaimed... claimed and what the narrowing amendment claims, and there's an implied disclaimer of all that is embraced within that difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.704" offset="7256353">And he's recognizing the significance of that difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.759" offset="7268578">And it... the Court cited a number of its prior decisions at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.301" offset="7286759">So, we think that applicants have been fairly on notice that prosecution history estoppel does apply to narrowing amendments and that there is considerable risk in narrowing claims and that they have to do that with great care with that in mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="2014.323" offset="8202821">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: First, I'd like to direct a response to Justice Breyer's question concerning that section of the statute that... that you were looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.954" offset="8253394">That's 112, paragraph 6, which says that you can claim the function of an element and you get protection for everything that has that function if it is the same as what's in the specification or its equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.060" offset="8321835">Next, I'd like to address my attention to Justice Stevenson's question with respect to literal infringement and doctrine of equivalents infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.679" offset="8352242">We were faced with the same question and we made an analysis of all the cases that were decided by the Federal circuit in the year 2000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.936" offset="8385260">We found that there were 31 cases that either held for the patentee or indicated they were going to hold for the patentee with respect to preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.315" offset="8418802">With respect to those cases, all but four were literal infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.938" offset="8437296">So, the answer to your question, for the year 2000, is that 27 of the 31 cases were directed to literal infringement and not... not doctrine of equivalents infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.011" offset="8485571">And you must keep in mind that the Federal circuit in this case, with respect to the doctrine of equivalents, didn't rule on the doctrine of equivalents in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.371" offset="8519007">They only ruled on the doctrine of equivalents with respect to when a patentee switches from one position to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.630" offset="8552131">He starts with one claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.866" offset="8557042">For some reason he sees that in order to get his patent, he is going to have to narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.407" offset="8575223">A good example is the example that Festo uses, going from adhesives to glue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.063" offset="8597793">You claim adhesives broadly when you start.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.830" offset="8608869">You're going to get protection for all adhesives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.621" offset="8616078">Then you find there's prior art or something else, maybe your specification isn't enabled, and you say I'm going to have to go to glue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.173" offset="8646276">What the Federal circuit says for that particular claim element, when you go from adhesives to glue, you are telling the public that you're going to rely--</text>

            <text syncTime="2167.676" offset="8816281">Where you have an original claim that has no prosecution history, then it's much tougher for the public to read and figure out what... what glue or adhesives mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.934" offset="8849300">But where you have this change from one position to another, a change that every patent attorney resists, then the Federal circuit says this is a narrowing that the public is entitled to rely upon.</text>

I'm sorry... you claimed adhesives and then you had to narrow it to glue, then in a lawsuit you found someone using adhesives, you would then say, well, my glue is really the same as adhesives under the doctrine of equivalents.</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.359" offset="13702955">The Federal circuit, since they hear a lot of patent cases, focused more in on the fact that it really wasn't the fact that it was prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.185" offset="13742348">What you wanted to get at was important changes, and they... they used the language statutory requirements of patentability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.820" offset="13772859">For example, one of the most important things is your claim being supported by the disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.501" offset="13803579">You can't claim what you don't invent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.647" offset="13812147">So, if your claim is real broad, the examiner says, but you've only disclosed this, so you can't foreclose all of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.639" offset="13840150">And so then you have to narrow it down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.323" offset="13850808">And that's a 112 change, and a 112 change is just as important as a 102 and a 103 change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.670" offset="13880274">And so the Federal circuit says if it's for a statutory requirement for patentability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.729" offset="13908486">And these are not trivial changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.586" offset="13915905">A patent attorney, when an examiner makes a change... a suggested change, says, well, how can I do that without narrowing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3452.951" offset="13957388">You can make changes with respect to clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.218" offset="13966478">Maybe the examiner likes 12 feet rather than 144 inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.791" offset="13988735">Maybe there are other things that he thinks will be more clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.301" offset="14002736">As long as they're not narrowing, the patent attorney is happy to make them, but as soon as he... he narrows, he knows that he's getting his client less.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.103" offset="14033979">With respect to foreseeability, I just wanted to make one comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.388" offset="14055086">Patent attorneys, when they draft broad claims, they draft broad claims because they don't know what is going to happen in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.683" offset="14088313">They want the broad claim because if something happens in the future, they're going to be covered for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.793" offset="14112764">Also, the patent attorney doesn't know everything that's happened in the past, and so he wants the broad claim because he gets much better coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.512" offset="14143589">For example, you don't want to go to... from adhesives to glue, because if you do that... I'm sorry.</text>

            <text syncTime="3516.869" offset="14213074">In this case, the Stoll patent moved one element... an element from one claim to another.</text>

            <text syncTime="3573.694" offset="14440340">I should say that I don't... when I answered you, Justice O'Connor, I did not mean to say that a limitation was the same as an amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.558" offset="14479837">It's just a statement of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.621" offset="14488091">A limitation is where the claim is when you first make it.</text>
