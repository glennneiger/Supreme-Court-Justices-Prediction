            <text syncTime="215.169" offset="1011740">One, let me try one more time to defend the general principle, which is simply that Congress in Title VII gave the EEOC a distinct cause of action, and so the extinguishment of the individual employee's cause of action shouldn't automatically extinguish the EEOC's cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.677" offset="1073807">But let me hone in on why I think that's so much more of a difficult case because in that case, the individuals settled their claim, so they have no claim to damages in an arbitration proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.871" offset="1110587">And so, it might make some sense to say that the EEOC has no claim to damages in a litigation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.672" offset="1133784">What is so anomalous about the decision below and the rule that respondent seeks in this case is that it seeks to limit the EEOC's ability to get victim-specific remedies in court even though those victim-specific remedies are available to the employee in the arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="264.908" offset="1210793">Well, here we have a case where the employee did not settle, but we were really discussing with you the possibility not presented in this case of a full settlement or a judgment in arbitration, disposing of the victim-specific relief, and asking you why then should EEOC continue to have a cause of action for the victim-specific relief, as opposed to broad injunctive relief, to address the overall problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="295.735" offset="1334091">--And I guess I do think there are two reasons why they would still have a cause of action in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.382" offset="1348615">One is that Title VII does give the EEOC an independent cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.903" offset="1370767">It's quite a remarkable statute in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.686" offset="1377872">It's unlike statutes this Court has analyzed in, say, the Newport News Shipbuilder case where it specifically contrasted Title VII as being the rare statute that gives the EEOC a duplicative cause of action to the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.897" offset="1426669">The second reason, though, is that generally, as a matter of privity, res judicata principles, the reason that you hold one party in... in... to a judgment that they didn't participate in to the consequences of that is because the party in the first action adequately represented the interests of the party that wasn't present.</text>

            <text syncTime="933.803" offset="3886359">Let me give you three reasons why I think the settlement case is more difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.835" offset="3898480">First, there's already been some expenditure of resources in that case, either... likely, either judicial or arbitral.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.923" offset="3918751">Second, Title VII seems to place particular importance on the EEOC's ability to be able to initiate the action and consider the early stages of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.308" offset="3956367">If, for whatever reason, we've gotten to the point where somebody has filed a claim and it's settled, that role has already been filled.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.829" offset="3978414">The third reason is another particularly important function of the EEOC under Title VII is to act as a safety valve, so if for some reason the individual is not willing or able to sue, maybe out of a fear of retaliation or something, in a particular case that vindicates the public interest, the EEOC has the ability to step in and fill that gap.</text>

            <text syncTime="1529.901" offset="6270711">The question, of course, is what effect does Mr. Baker's arbitration agreement have on the EEOC's litigation remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.773" offset="6298192">The Fourth Circuit correctly held that the EEOC could bring in court a claim for broad-based injunctive relief and declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.911" offset="6334764">However, because Mr. Baker had agreed to arbitrate his claims, he could not seek relief in court specifically for Mr. Baker.</text>

            <text syncTime="1565.859" offset="6414594">As a matter of fact, the position, as I understand it from Mr. Clement, is that an individual can settle a claim and then the EEOC can later sue on behalf of that individual and recover relief for that individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.997" offset="6467048">And that particular principle, if that is what the EEOC is espousing today, contradicts their own policy guidance--</text>

            <text syncTime="3344.626" offset="13529618">I want to first pick up on Justice Souter's hypothetical about the contempt proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.145" offset="13543724">It seems to me that if that were enforced by civil compensatory contempt, rather than a criminal contempt action brought by the U.S. attorney, that he'd... he'd have the same problem at the end of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.931" offset="13578832">Respondents invoke the proposition that the EEOC has to take the victim as we find him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.923" offset="13602760">The problem with that is that principle applies with respect to damages problems, like a failure to mitigate, that apply to the individual employee whether or not he arbitrates or litigates and applies equally to an EEOC enforcement action and to the individual claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.543" offset="13665245">What's so unique about this is that respondent is attempting to take an agreement that does not restrict Baker's ability to get any remedy in the arbitration proceeding and turn it into a restriction on the remedies available to the EEOC in its action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.747" offset="13722088">The problem is, this is not, at bottom, a restriction on damages or a problem with remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.595" offset="13745493">It is a forum selection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.874" offset="13750613">And you have a statutory structure that allows two people to initiate an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.722" offset="13770049">When one of those parties has signed a forum selection clause and hasn't even initiated the action, it seems that even in the general case there would be no reason to restrict the other party's access to forums or their remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.077" offset="13819368">That would seem to be a fortiori true for a statute like Title VII that gives the EEOC a right of first refusal over the initiation of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.006" offset="13855103">Another point I'd like to emphasize is that, as Justice Stevens made clear, there are currently no suits pending against employers in a situation where there has been a previous settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.712" offset="13893973">In fact, there are only 450 suits currently in the entirety of the EEOC's docket, and I think that puts this case in perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.890" offset="13926679">In the literally 99 cases out of 100, an employer's arbitration agreement will govern and the only Title VII claim that will be brought is the employee's claim in arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.036" offset="13971296">In the 1 case out of 100, in the extreme case where there's some important public principle at stake or there's particularly egregious conduct, the EEOC's public enforcement action serves as a valuable safety valve that allows it to preserve the possibility of precedent-setting in public judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.369" offset="14040573">The third and final point I'd like to make is that whatever the answer is in the settlement context, there's absolutely no reason to take a restriction that only restricts the available forum and not the remedies and turn it into a restriction on remedies but not the forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.701" offset="14101908">Here respondent seeks not only to bind the EEOC to the results of an arbitration, but to prevent the EEOC from seeking all remedies even when there hasn't been any arbitration proceeding initiated at all.</text>
