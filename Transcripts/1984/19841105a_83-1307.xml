            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="119030">We will hear arguments first this morning in the United States v. Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.815" offset="146197">Mr. Levy, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="10.799" stopTime="195.138">
            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="10.799" offset="162184">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, since the time of this Court's decision in Dunn v. United States, more than 50 years ago, the rule has been settled in the federal system that inconsistency in a jury's verdict is not a ground to set aside an otherwise valid conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.440" offset="240761">The issue in this case is the validity of an exception to the Dunn rule, adopted by the Ninth Circuit below, for the offense under 21 U.S.C. Section 843 (b), of using a telephone to facilitate a drug felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.281" offset="308052">The relevant facts are undisputed and may be briefly summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.866" offset="326442">Respondent was charged in 15 counts with offenses rising out an extensive drug distribution operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.000" offset="358939">It was agreed by all in proceedings below, the Respondent's husband and son were the principal operators, and the Respondent was a relatively more minor participant.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.956" offset="402824">Insofar as pertinent here, Respondent was charged in one count with conspiring to possess cocaine with intent to distribute it, and in three counts, with using the telephone to facilitate the cocaine conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.317" offset="464264">The jury convicted Respondent on the three telephone counts and acquitted her on the conspiracy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.561" offset="489237">On Respondent's appeal, the Ninth Circuit set aside the three telephone convictions on the ground of inconsistency in the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.129" offset="527481">The court concluded that because the jury had acquitted Respondent on the conspiracy charge that was the offense alleged to have been facilitated by the use of the telephone, the telephone counts could not stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.575" offset="581293">The Court recognized the Dunn rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.307" offset="592160">The inconsistency in a jury's verdict is not a ground to reverse its convictions; but it held that an exception to Dunn exists for the telephone facilitation offense under Section 843(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="131.787" offset="646077">We submit that this was error.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.209" offset="655794">Our position, in brief, is that this case is controlled by Dunn and that the decision below is flatly inconsistent with both the exact holding and the fundamental rationale of Dunn.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.776" offset="702083">Dunn and its progeny, to which this Court has consistently adhered over the last half century, recognized several basic principles: First, the Dunn rule recognizes that a jury, in the exercise of its power of lenity can acquit a defendant, even though it is entirely convinced of his guilt under the law and the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.460" offset="792780">Dunn thus makes clear that in the context of inconsistent verdicts, an acquittal is not to be deemed a determination by the jury that it found the Government's evidence inadequate to establish the defendant's guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.341" offset="848369">Because of the jury's power of lenity, Dunn establishes that an inconsistency in the verdict does not undermine or impeach the otherwise valid convictions that the jury returns.</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="195.138" offset="899569">Mr. Levy, can I ask you a question?</text>
            <text syncTime="197.371" offset="908450">Did the Ninth Circuit cite the Dunn case?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="199.812" offset="918272">It did not cite the Dunn case in its original decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.433" offset="928721">The Government sought rehearing, and the court in denying our petition for rehearing, issued a supplemental opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.047" offset="951187">And in that opinion, it cited to and purported to distinguish or find an exception to the Dunn decision.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="215.132" stopTime="219.405">
            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="215.132" offset="979503">I see; because in the first opinion, they merely said there was no evidence to support these convictions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="219.405" stopTime="246.783">
            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="219.405" offset="996640">That's correct, and that was said in response to the Government's argument that the verdicts were not, in fact, inconsistent because the jury could have found the Respondent used the telephone to facilitate some offense other than the conspiracy of which she was acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.914" offset="1050661">We have not raised, separately raised that issue for review in this Court, but we did contend in the Court of Appeals that there was no inconsistency on the facts, and the court rejected that because it found there was no evidence in the record to support that theory.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="246.783" stopTime="252.206">
            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="246.783" offset="1106145">Well, did they find no evidence in the record to support the theory, or no evidence in the record to support the conviction?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="252.206" stopTime="421.066">
            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="252.206" offset="1127774">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.007" offset="1131014">Our reading of the opinion, I think, makes it quite clear that they found no evidence in the initial opinion to support the Government's contention that the verdicts were not, in fact, inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.081" offset="1163301">Now, the Dunn rule also recognizes, in accordance with generally established principles, that convictions are not to be upset by speculation or inquiry into the jury process for the actual reasons for the jury's inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.453" offset="1228816">In this way, Dunn protects the integrity of the jury verdict and ensures that an acquittal based on leniency is not later invoked to overturn the very conviction that the jury determined to be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.803" offset="1294227">In other words, Dunn prevents a defendant from isolating the portion of the verdict favorable to him and using it to challenge the remaining and unfavorable portion that was simultaneously reached by the very same jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.071" offset="1347308">No one in this case, neither Respondent nor the Ninth Circuit below, takes issue with the general validity of the Dunn rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.868" offset="1386491">However, it is contended that an exception to Dunn should be made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.351" offset="1408434">In arguing for such an exception, Respondent emphasizes the compound predicate nature of the telephone charges on which he was convicted; that is, the telephone convictions, which are the compound offense, rests on the use of the telephone to facilitate another, or predicate, offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.685" offset="1485757">This factor provides no basis to depart from Dunn.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.077" offset="1503311">First, the jury lenity rationale of Dunn is just as applicable in cases of compound predicate offenses as in any other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.992" offset="1538942">Indeed, in this case, for example, Respondent, who concededly was a more minor participant in the drug operation, could well have been acquitted on the conspiracy count because the jury concluded that that charge, although supported by the evidence, was disproportionate to Respondent's involvement and culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.356" offset="1616369">And the convictions, based on the telephone calls in which she personally participated, were both adequate and more appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.651" offset="1649597">In addition, Dunn itself involved inconsistent verdicts on compound predicate offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.456" offset="1676764">There, the defendant was convicted of maintaining a nuisance which required the jury to find as one of the elements, that liquor was unlawfully kept for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.812" offset="1718246">However, the jury acquitted the defendant on the possession and sale counts that served as the predicate for the nuisance charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.938" offset="1754713">On this record, and over a lengthy dissent that stressed the interrelation of the offenses, the court affirmed the nuisance conviction and held that consistency in the verdicts is not necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.451" offset="1844783">We're only saying that the court was well aware of the interrelation of the offenses in reaching its holding in Dunn that consistency was not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.638" offset="1873518">Since those offenses were, in fact, compound and predicate offenses, very similar to what we have here, we think that the precise holding in Dunn controls this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.784" offset="1910090">And Dunn directly forecloses an exception to the inconsistent verdict rule for compound predicate offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.359" offset="1936421">Now, beyond the applicability of the jury lenity rationale here and the precise holding in Dunn itself, there is simply no analytical basis for carving out an exception to the Dunn rule for compound predicate offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.506" offset="1997025">Two closely related theories have been suggested; first, that the inconsistency renders the evidence insufficient to prove the compound offense; and second, that the inconsistency estops or precludes the Government from establishing the compound offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.639" offset="2069541">Neither of these theories is persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.651" offset="2081557">Let me discuss, first, the insufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.352" offset="2092424">Under this theory, which is advanced both by Respondent and by the Ninth Circuit below, the argument is that a jury's acquittal means that it rejected the Government's evidence and found that the Defendant did not commit the predicate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.575" offset="2157312">And, therefore, the Government's proof of a compound offense is necessarily insufficient, because it fails to establish the required predicate element.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.900" offset="2194615">This argument is squarely inconsistent with Dunn, which specifically recognizes that an acquittal does not establish the Defendant's innocence, but instead should reflect the jury's exercise of its power lenity, even though it believed that the Defendant, in fact, was guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.131" offset="2259503">Moreover, nothing in this argument limited the compound and predicate offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.054" offset="2283223">Rather, the proof supporting the convictions will always be inadequate if, as Respondent urges, one disregards or subtracts from the record the evidence that a court believes the jury did not accept, as shown by its acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.314" offset="2344245">If this were not so, the verdicts would not have been inconsistent in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.877" offset="2366501">Indeed, under this theory, Dunn itself was incorrectly decided, because the nuisance conviction in that case could not be supported without the evidence relating to the possession and sale counts on which the Defendant was acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.729" offset="2429926">Thus, contrary to Respondent's characterization, this case involves a narrow and unique exception to the Dunn rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.095" offset="2463363">Acceptance of our insufficiency of the evidence argument would be a fundamental repudiation of Dunn.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.538" offset="2489172">Now, of course, entirely irrespective of Dunn, the evidence must be sufficient to support the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.462" offset="2520832">But Respondent's argument confuses the quite separate issues of the sufficiency of the evidence and the consistency of the verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.899" offset="2554583">The former involves the evidentiary record.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.263" offset="2563987">The latter involves the reliability or rationality of the jury process.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.437" offset="2588751">The sufficiency question asks whether the Government adduced adequate proof under traditional standards to establish every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, as the jury must have found in returning its convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.663" offset="2641623">That depends upon the totality of the proof in the record and is unaffected by the other counts that were brought or the jury's disposition of those counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.051" offset="2687180">Respondent's argument is unavailing because it blurs the analytically distinct issues of sufficiency and consistency and is simply an attempt to reformulate in the guise of the insufficiency of the evidence the inconsistent verdict argument that was rejected in Dunn.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.884" offset="2762517">Now, the other and closely-related line of argument for an exception to Dunn, which is advanced primarily in the Third and Eleventh Circuit decision cited in our briefs, is that the jury's acquittal on the predicate counts estops or precludes the Government from establishing the compound offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.487" offset="2836914">This argument, too, is without merit, for much the same reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.179" offset="2855722">First, as for the insufficiency of the evidence argument, the estoppel argument is fundamentally at odds with Dunn and the recognition of the jury's power of lenity to acquit against the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.887" offset="2902534">So, too, the estoppel exception is not really an exception at all, though it would essentially eviscerate the Dunn rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.424" offset="2932627">Nothing in the estoppel argument limits at the compound and predicate offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="738.125" offset="3071494">As we demonstrate in our brief, that res judicata discussion was of doubtful correctness at the time, for the court had previously indicated that res judicata does apply to criminal cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="783.093" offset="3251321">To the contrary, as we indicate, Dunn was neither correct at the time, nor is it sound in that respect now.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.480" offset="3276921">Indeed, the general law of estoppel is that there is no internal or single case estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.341" offset="3300326">It has never been thought that the law of estoppel applies to single proceedings, and the purpose of the doctrine of estoppel, to prevent needless relitigation and promote judicial economy, is simply inapplicable to a joint trial of different counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.742" offset="3369917">In addition, it would be wholly unjustified to pick out one part of an inconsistent verdict and use that to override another part that was simultaneously returned by the very same jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.942" offset="3422788">That simply doesn't make any sense, to pick and choose among the parts of the verdict and give priority to one over the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.918" offset="3450687">So, for those reasons, we don't think either the general law of estoppel or the res judicata discussion in Dunn itself gives any support to the estoppel exception, as urged.</text>

            <text syncTime="970.376" offset="4000512">Well, we think every time that the Court has considered the inconsistent verdict issue since Dunn, it has relied on the basic point that inconsistency in the verdicts is not required, and it has never cited or relied on the res judicata discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.249" offset="4068013">And I think that is equally true in the lower courts, with the exception of these decisions under 843(b) that have now resurrected the discredit res judicata analysis and used that as a basis for finding an exception to the Dunn rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.377" offset="4124437">Now, the estoppel exception, in addition to all the other problems, simply cannot be limited to compound and predicate offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.642" offset="4157561">This theory, if it were accepted by the Court, would extend far beyond the present context and would subject all inconsistent verdicts to the usual rules of preclusion that apply in separate proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.161" offset="4215657">Contrary to the Dunn rule, which results in inconsistent verdicts being upheld, the estoppel theory would mean that inconsistent verdicts would always be revised because, by definition, a verdict that is truly inconsistent cannot meet the usual standards of preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.043" offset="4287128">Indeed, under modern principles of collateral estoppel, as I just discussed with Justice Stevens, the inconsistent verdicts in Dunn themselves would be impermissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="1084.101" offset="4455357">The Government's position, succinctly stated, is Dunn permits no exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.334" offset="4476359">In the example of a person charged with robbery in felony murder for a death resulting from the commission of that robbery, if there was a finding of not guilty on the robbery, the murder conviction could stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.084" offset="4543337">And the essence of our position, as articulated by the circuit courts below, was that 843(b) is a very narrow offense which has, as an essential element, the commission of a felony prescribed in Title XXI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.007" offset="4618988">In the Dunn case that the Court had before it in 1932, there was three discrete misdemeanors: maintaining a nuisance, a building where liquor was kept for sale, the offense of possession, and the offense of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.887" offset="4686488">And there was some overlap, admittedly, but we all know that possession for sale is an offense other than simply possession for sale itself, and that some of the language was not necessary in the Government's position, which was even referred to by Justice Holmes, was that you could have the commission of one without the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.083" offset="4767259">In this particular case, there has to be some balance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2064.572" offset="8377277">Just a couple of points, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.745" offset="8385949">Respondent's argument is most notable for its avoidance of the issue presented in this case on the inconsistent verdict issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.760" offset="8418028">It raises a number of questions... variance notice, conflict of counsel... and we agree with Justice Rehnquist's characterization that these simply are not appropriately considered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.995" offset="8450942">They were not preserved below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.558" offset="8457211">They are not alternative grounds for affirming the decision, the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and they have nothing to do with the issue that we presented in our petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.152" offset="8491588">Now, Respondent argued at some length the sufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.625" offset="8505486">We think that this case is not a sufficiency of the evidence case, and that that simply confuses the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.449" offset="8524816">The Respondent did not raise a sufficiency of the evidence objection in the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals did not make a traditional review of the evidentiary record to determine whether the proof was adequate to support the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.085" offset="8575285">That simply is not an issue that was ever raised in the Court of Appeals and it was not presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.990" offset="8594929">But, beyond that, we don't see how there could be any real doubt about the sufficiency of the evidence on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.215" offset="8619797">We summarized it in our brief so that the Court would understand the case and see that there was no problem with the sufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.279" offset="8644143">The Respondent engaged in several telephone calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.890" offset="8654488">She knew who the thin man was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.861" offset="8662429">She knew his telephone number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.531" offset="8669117">She knew what was meant by the coded reference to "coupons" as money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.685" offset="8685730">Reading the transcripts of the wire tap records, we don't think there can be any serious question about the sufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.261" offset="8720003">And the District Court, at the sentencing proceeding, after sitting through the entirety of this trial, made it clear that he thought the evidence was ample and that the jury correctly resolved the telephone counts against the Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.027" offset="8767128">The sufficiency of the evidence issue that Respondent seeks to present would be no different if the conspiracy charge had never been brought; if this were only a three count indictment on the telephone offenses, alleging, but not separately charging, that a conspiracy was facilitated by the use of the telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.334" offset="8856362">On that record, if the jury convicted on all three telephone counts, there would be no inconsistency in the verdict, and the record would be just as it is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.198" offset="8887814">And in that circumstance, we don't think there could be any realistic question about the sufficiency of the record to support the convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.183" offset="8915712">The issue in this case, which Respondent has refused to recognize, is whether the Dunn rule, as applied and reaffirmed consistently by this Court over a half century in cases like Dotterweich and Hamling and Standefer, and as recently as a few years ago, in Harris v. Rivera, whether the inconsistent verdict rule is applicable here, as we contend, or whether there is some exception for the offense of telephone facilitation under Section 843(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.680" offset="9025740">For the reasons stated today and in our briefs, we submit that there is no such exception; that is case is controlled by the Dunn rule; and that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>
