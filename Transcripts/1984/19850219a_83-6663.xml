            <text syncTime="87.289" offset="472600">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, Petitioner this morning argues that the jurisdictional exception noted by this Court in its 1912 decision, Diaz.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.597" offset="513874">v. United States, has been implicitly or by implication rejected in the subsequent decisions of the Court in Waller v. Florida and Robinson v. Neil.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.352" offset="552849">The Petitioner was involved in an automobile accident in August 1981 in southern New Mexico and, as a result of that accident, two things happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.708" offset="586285">He was charged with violation of municipal ordinances for driving while intoxicated and for careless driving, and another party of that accident was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.997" offset="623484">The Petitioner went to court in Carlsbad, New Mexico, pleaded no contest to the charges, was convicted upon his plea, and was sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.269" offset="664548">That sentence included confinement in an alcohol rehabilitation unit for a period of 21 days, followed by a six-month period of probation, which included mandatory weekly alcohol counseling sessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.760" offset="710524">In September of 1981, the party who had been injured in that accident died, apparently as a result of those injuries, and the State commenced a felony prosecution for vehicular homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.634" offset="753991">The Defendant was tried and convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.951" offset="763291">His first conviction was set aside by the New Mexico Court of Appeals on an unrelated ground, and on remand his newly-retained defense counsel filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that based upon double jeopardy principles, the prior convictions for lesser included offenses in the Carlsbad Municipal Court barred a subsequent State prosecution for the greater offense of vehicular homicide.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_thomas_sullivan" startTime="190.705" stopTime="269.974">
            <label>Mr. J. Thomas Sullivan</label>
            <text syncTime="190.705" offset="886276">The State was required to prove either that as a result of unlawful operation of a vehicular and resulting accident, that a person had either been injured and sustained great bodily injury, or had died as a result of that accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.949" offset="951268">The State was required further, in order to establish the felony offense, that the accused was either operating the vehicular while driving while intoxicated or under the influence of drugs, or that he was operating the vehicular recklessly.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.142" offset="1008006">After his second conviction, the New Mexico Court of Appeals reversed, applying double jeopardy law, principles enunciated in decisions in this Court, to hold that the prior convictions in municipal court for lesser included offenses barred the subsequent vehicular homicide prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.205" offset="1084284">In so doing, the Court of Appeals made four distinct important findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.990" offset="1103405">First, it rejected the argument advanced by the State that the necessary or essential facts exception of Diaz v. United States applied, to hold that the State was justified in waiting to commence its vehicular homicide prosecution until after that injured person had died.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.786" offset="1170592">The Court of Appeals looked to the wording of the New Mexico statute which permits the State to commence a felony prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.928" offset="1231196">But the threshold of the decision in the New Mexico Supreme Court critically relies on what the Court of Appeals did in this case and what it didn't do.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.667" offset="1270067">So you say it's necessary for us to understand the Court of Appeals' reasoning in order to understand the Supreme Court's reasoning?</text>

          <turn speaker="j_thomas_sullivan" startTime="291.638" stopTime="489.934">
            <label>Mr. J. Thomas Sullivan</label>
            <text syncTime="291.638" offset="1290024">I believe it's necessary to understand the Court of Appeals' reasoning to understand why we believe that we're entitled to the bar of double jeopardy when the decisions of this Court were applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.411" offset="1321058">The necessary and essential facts exception of Diaz were rejected by the Court of Appeals because the State could have prosecuted because the injury, causing great bodily injury to the victim of that accident was available, was known to the State at the time the traffic offenses were prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.074" offset="1403709">Second, the Court of Appeals held that the reckless driving and careless driving offenses are greater and lesser included offenses for double jeopardy purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.263" offset="1444460">That's been conceded by the State throughout the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.632" offset="1457939">Third, the Court of Appeals held essentially that DWI and reckless driving are lesser included offenses under every case of the felony offense of vehicular homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.206" offset="1508303">They are included because the vehicular homicide statute defines the offense in terms of a prior commission of one of three modes of driving unlawfully: driving while intoxicated, driving while under the influence of drugs, or driving recklessly.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.067" offset="1571729">What the Court of Appeals finally rejected was the State's argument that the jurisdictional exception which was noted by this Court in Diaz would apply as an exception to the double jeopardy bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.709" offset="1622302">As I understand it, the jurisdictional exception applies where a court does not have jurisdiction over an offense and therefore could not have adjudicated an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.767" offset="1666501">And the New Mexico Court of Appeals held that by implication, Waller.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.985" offset="1683428">v. Florida, Robinson v. Neil, had overruled the applicability of the jurisdictional exception when you're looking at municipal court convictions for lesser included offenses of a felony prosecution which is later commenced in a court of general jurisdiction in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.465" offset="1757302">This morning, I believe we are focusing on the Supreme Court decision, the decision of the Supreme Court of New Mexico, which held that Diaz v. United States is still applicable with respect to the jurisdictional exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.075" offset="1819787">The Court essentially held that because the Carlsbad Muncipal Court had no jurisdiction over the felony offense of vehicular homicide its judgments on the lesser included traffic offenses could not serve to bar prosecution for that felony offense in the State District Court, which is a court of general jurisdiction in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.888" offset="1898991">The State has argued in its brief to this Court an alternative theory which it suggests would have supported the judgment of the New Mexico Supreme Court, arguing a different lesser included offense analysis than was ever argued in the New Mexico courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.748" offset="1966491">And we would argue, for purposes of our petition and for purposes of decision of this Court, that the real issue to be focused upon is whether or not the jurisdictional exception of Diaz remains valid in light of Waller v. Florida and Robinson v. Neil.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.776" offset="2034514">In fact, in those cases, strikingly similar facts to those presented in the instant case resulted in reversals of subsequently obtained convictions--</text>

            <text syncTime="2115.812" offset="8586651">I think the purposes that a legislature directs itself to when it describes crimes different and penalties different, recognizes the fact that we have a desperate need for an almost administrative system to handle traffic citations and a more serious, formal, criminal mode in which to handle a death case, because in that case the legislature intends to serve the public interest in punishing people for the consequences of the transaction that gave rise to the death.</text>

            <text syncTime="2242.188" offset="9092173">Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.054" offset="9095621">The Court of Appeals in its decision held under New Mexico statute 66A-101C, vehicular homicide can be committed only by reckless driving or DWI.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.979" offset="9139402">If you look at the statute that defines the felony offense of reckless... of vehicular homicide it's predicated on a finding of either DWI or driving while under the influence of drugs or a finding that the Defendant drove recklessly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.255" offset="9196453">They are, by statute and by the decisions of the court, lesser included offenses of vehicular homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.492" offset="9221427">With respect to the argument that Defendant received a relatively minor sentence and for that reason we should not apply the double jeopardy clause, the Defendant subjected himself at trial in the Carlsbad Municipal Court to a potential punishment of 90 days confinement in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.521" offset="9285583">If there's a problem in this case, the problem results from the State legislature's decision in setting penalties, which the attorney general now apparently argues are their grant of concurring jurisdiction to municipalities to penalize DWI.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.696" offset="9346187">If that's the problem, if 98 municipalities cannot seem to have the police officers correctly assess the merits of a prosecution at the time, the simple solution to that is for the legislature to withdraw from the municipality the power to try DWI as a traffic ticket offense, to provide only that the District Court, upon review by the district attorney, and presentment of an indictment or filing of the criminal information, should have the power to assess which charges should be brought.</text>

            <text syncTime="2340.252" offset="9484427">I think that's a relatively simple solution if the problems the attorney general says are of the magnitude he claims that they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.357" offset="9512849">It seems to me that the Petitioner's punishment in this case was appropriate, and the legislature determined it was appropriate to fit a first offense DWI situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.546" offset="9553600">It might have been appropriate whether there was a death or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.848" offset="9566870">The trial court certainly was within its jurisdiction at the district court level to probate the entire sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.002" offset="9591425">The Defendant was placed on a period of probation for six months after a 21-day confinement in an alcohol care unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.425" offset="9617129">I believe that's something more than DWI school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.127" offset="9627996">But nevertheless, he was subjected to punishment, and he discharged at least the majority of that punishment before the State came back and charged him with the greater offense in District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.082" offset="9671778">It seems to me that this kind of multiple prosecution is exactly what the double jeopardy clause protects against, the filing of a relatively minor charge in a court of limited jurisdiction, and then the subsequent filing of a greater charge with a minor charge was clearly the lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.044" offset="9739591">To follow the attorney general's reasoning, all significant or felony charges could be broken down into constituent elements, could be prosecuted in courts of limited jurisdiction; the State could evaluate the merits of its case and proceed to felony prosecution later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.470" offset="9797374">That's the kind of thing that it seems to me the double jeopardy clause has protected against traditionally, and it seems to me that the opinions in Illinois v. Vitale and Brown v. Ohio implicitly recognize there is no question in this case but that these are lesser included offenses, that the Petitioner discharged his duty in going to court, pleading no contest, accepting his punishment, and then in discharging that punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.252" offset="9892460">For that reason, we believe that the decision in the New Mexico Supreme Court in applying a jurisdictional exception, which I still think is rooted in the notion of dual sovereignty where you're talking about municipal and subsequent State prosecutions, was simply incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.495" offset="9953378">And this Court should reverse the judgment of the New Mexico Supreme Court.</text>
