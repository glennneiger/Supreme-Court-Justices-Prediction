            <text syncTime="899.613" offset="3728219">So, it would be our position that the final judgment of the Indian Claims Commission was certified by the General Accounting Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.420" offset="3775448">It was then automatically appropriated.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.903" offset="3789345">The moneys were automatically appropriated, and that payment then put into effect the finality provisions of Section 22(a).</text>

            <text syncTime="936.087" offset="3874086">But as I said earlier, we find a major distinction between the appropriation, the payment, and distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.504" offset="3911807">This Court, I might add, in its decision in v. Weeks, a case which is ignored totally by respondents in their brief, found that very specific thing, that under the Indian Claims Commission Act, payment is separate and apart from distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.447" offset="3991533">Payment is a payment of a tribal claim, and subsequently there can be a distribution to individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.322" offset="4019014">We also... I would say the legislative history makes it pretty clear that Congress intended Section 22(a) to be a final... an act of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.538" offset="4067915">Those provisions were there to bring finality to the whole process.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.432" offset="4087455">Indeed, it was a very conscious decision by Congress, because the Department of Justice in fact went before Congress and criticized that very provision, went up and said, you shouldn't pass it, it is not a good idea, because in passing that provision, what you would be doing, Congress, is surrendering your prerogative to review all the claims coming against the United States--</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.857" offset="4169166">Unfortunately, this happens every once in a while.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.317" offset="4178988">Congress did not pay attention to our advice, and specifically kept 22(a) in the statute for the express purpose of providing the finality that they desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.214" offset="4226635">And I also would add that the respondents have made an argument that they had not been accorded due process under the Indian Claims Commission activities, and the hearings there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1145.894" offset="4713348">The Dann family has been ranching this area for three generations, and using and occupying it for countless generations before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.891" offset="4749293">The government now seeks to eject the Danns from their property without regard for the lawfulness of their occupancy or the validity of their title on the merits because of a ruling in a collateral proceeding where the extinguishment issue was never in contention nor actually litigated, and where the interests of the Danns were not represented.</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.100" offset="5482184">Yes, and it was conceded that the Indians have title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.622" offset="5500261">The problem was that the government had to prove that it had acquired title, and of course it tried to evade that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.367" offset="5527219">We went to the Court of Appeals once, and the Court of Appeals ruled that the court had to rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.940" offset="5545505">The court couldn't find that the government had ever acquired title, so the court at the request of the government and over our demands for a trial waited for years for the government to come up with this piece of paper that gave it a preclusive effect about a trespass case that happened years before, and the reason it did that is because the government could not prove any lawful right it had to move these Indians off their land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.928" offset="5657414">We would like to make three major arguments in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.692" offset="5676535">First, the Danns are not precluded in this action by the judgment in a statutory claims proceeding because the statute states that discharge does not occur until payment, and payment cannot be made until Congress legislates the necessary direction to effectuate that payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.375" offset="5743200">Second, even if payment is made, the preclusive effect on this action is limited because the interests of the property owner, the interests of the property owner was not represented, and because the issues involved in those proceedings were entirely different and based on entirely different premises and concepts of law from those involved in this case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.809" offset="5837032">And third, in the alternative, the Danns have asserted throughout the proceedings, starting with in the answer, very specifically that they have individual Indian title to the lands involved in this case, and this Court has held such individual rights are different from and survive, individual Indian title survives a relinquishment of tribal title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.724" offset="5936610">Now, the judgment in the... addressing my affirmative argument, the judgment in the claims proceeding was obtained by the "Western Shoshone identifiable group".</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.744" offset="5988751">Western Shoshone identifiable group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.717" offset="6004633">The government contends the judgment funds are tribal funds, and in answering the question, said, well, they are being held for the benefit of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.724" offset="6040682">However, the Western Shoshone identifiable group is not a tribal entity in any real sense or in the sense that it has a political structure or even that it is a definable class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.290" offset="6086867">It right now is just a name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.011" offset="6097838">The Indian Claims Commission specifically found that the Western Shoshone had no political structure at that time, and designated the claimholder to be an identifiable group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.440" offset="6147471">Now, this is one of the very peculiar things about the way the Indian Claims Commission Act worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.702" offset="6164607">You could have a lawsuit with the plaintiff, the identity of the plaintiff being held in suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.668" offset="6200447">The Court of Claims and this Court have held, in fact, in the case that counsel relies on so heavily, Delaware Tribal Business Committee versus Weeks, the Court of Claims and this Court have held that the designation of the existing entity, entities, or class of persons entitled to share in that award is an exercise of the plenary power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.383" offset="6287278">Congress exercises that power in the distribution legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.636" offset="6308281">Until Congress legislations a distribution plan, no person, class of persons, or entity, no tribe, no tribe has any sort of enforceable interest in the judgment funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.815" offset="6365019">The only thing that has an interest in the judgment funds is an identifiable group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.419" offset="6387379">But nobody can claim to be that identifiable group until Congress acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.032" offset="6409845">And this Court has held that Constitutionally, using its plenary power, Congress can designate anybody it wants to be that entity, as long as there is just some connection with Congress's concern for Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.034" offset="6477868">So, it is not, it is not as if the Navajo nation or the Western Shoshone nation, which now has a political entity, and that is the Western Shoshone National Council, it is not as if the Western Shoshone National Council has a beneficial interest in those funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.718" offset="6560623">The Western Shoshone identifiable group may be all persons of Western Shoshone descent, like all persons of Irish descent, and we litigate all persons of Irish descent, and then try to use a preclusive effect against the Republic of Ireland, say, in regard to their embassy, and say, well, we brought an action on the part of all people of Irish descent without anybody who can come in and speak for them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.023" offset="7453802">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I was discussing that until Congress does legislate approval of a distribution plan, these funds are in limbo because there is no existing entity that has a beneficiary interest, and this Court has held that no entity has a right to assert such an interest, that that is entirely within the plenary power of Congress to designate who is going to be this identifiable group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.877" offset="7593296">But what is more, the Secretary of Interior, who holds these funds, is prohibited under the Distribution of Judgment Funds Act from using the funds for the benefit of any person or any entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.306" offset="7654945">It is not as if he were holding the funds for the benefit of the Shoshone tribe and could set up a scholarship plan or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.601" offset="7692143">He is supposed to keep interest, get interest for these funds, but he, too, is just to hold them until Congress designates who owns these funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.170" offset="7738432">The Court of Claims, in twice refusing to open the question of whether all lands had actually been taken in the Western Shoshone claims proceeding, commented on both occasions that the Danns or that the Indians who wanted to continue collateral litigation could do so, could continue their collateral litigation by delaying appropriation and "the direction necessary to pay".</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.390" offset="7859327">The Court of Claims is intimately familiar with how the Indian Claims Commission judgments are paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.937" offset="7897466">The Court of Claims did not say that upon appropriation we were stopped, we could stop the direction necessary to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.814" offset="7936963">And I don't see how you can construe the direction necessary to pay to be anything other than this legislation which is yet to come.</text>

            <text syncTime="2704.259" offset="10946792">There is a profound difference, and several members of this Court in various cases have noted this, between the sort of litigation that is going on in the Claims Commission, where they are dealing in windfall, really, for something that happened to somebody's ancestors, or reparation for something that happened long ago, and fundamental possessory property rights, which we are litigating in this case, and that gets me to our third argument, and it is in the alternative, our individual property rights, regardless of Western Shoshone title.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.843" offset="11401113">This Court has held in past decisions, and I hope it is not currently the law, but it has held in past decisions that Congress can do anything it wants with aboriginal title.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.850" offset="11437162">It can confiscate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.741" offset="11440715">But it is only Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.321" offset="11446984">This is a division of powers question again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.311" offset="11455030">The executive branch has to respect Indian title as if it were fee simple, almost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.156" offset="11490348">They hold the fee, but they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.067" offset="11494005">So, you can assert aboriginal title against the government, and that is quite clear, and this Court so held in the Lane case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.174" offset="11522426">In the Santa Fe case, they held, the Court held, this Court held that the aboriginal tribal title had been relinquished, but noted that that would have no preclusive effect on the assertion of individual Indian title, and individual Indian title is that which... in that case they were referring to is any Indians who stayed on the land and used it.</text>

I have been authorized to do so... that the government will not try to collect damages for trespass prior to the determination of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.369" offset="11923249">Also, Justice Stevens raised the question of the permits, grazing permits, and Justice O'Connor properly noted that the fee is based upon the head of cattle on the land, and for the Court's information, as of January, 1984, the fee was $1.37 per animal unit per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.061" offset="12002034">I would also point out that under the regulations of the Department of Interior, that if the cattle grazing is for subsistence purposes only, of people living on contiguous lands, as here, there are provisions for application for a free permit for that grazing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.753" offset="12072774">And finally, in an exchange with Justice Rehnquist... I want to reference back to that exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.330" offset="12111017">I want to clarify that one aspect of the government's position, our submission really does not depend on the proposition that the mere filing of the ejection action extinguished aboriginal title.</text>

            <text syncTime="3008.246" offset="12162739">Well, certainly no one would suggest that the mere filing of an ejection complaint would extinguish any title at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.253" offset="12194713">My point was that when the government is up against aboriginal, at least aboriginal Indian title, that unless you claim under a deed from the government, your claim is no good against the government.</text>
