            <text syncTime="1092.860" offset="4505469">The District Court found there was a rational basis for these decisions, and the District Court based its holding that the mentally retarded persons are not a suspect or a quasi-suspect class requiring heightened judicial scrutiny for the Fourteen Amendment equal protection analysis on the reasoning of the Third Circuit case of Doe versus Colautte.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.208" offset="4610795">Now, the Fifth Circuit, of course, reversed, holding that mentally retarded people are a quasi-suspect class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.083" offset="4654263">Now, in order to reach its decision, the Fifth Circuit created yet another constitutionally protected class consisting of all mentally retarded persons in the United States, and we believe contrary to this Court's decision in Youngberg versus Romeo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.864" offset="4729391">This group is not the discrete insular minority envisioned by this Court in U.S. versus Carolene Products, but it is rather a large, diverse, and amorphous class proscribed by this Court in San Antonio versus Rodriguez.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.710" offset="4816849">Mental retardation, we have noted the definition of it earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.681" offset="4840672">It is a problem of reduced ability to learn, difficulty with abstract thinking, judgment, problem-solving, and retention, and includes problems of social adjustment and economic productivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.143" offset="4906605">Now, the mentally retarded are a diverse class, a diverse group within themselves, consisting of several subgroups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.081" offset="4942341">The mildly retarded constitutes approximately 89 percent of all mentally retarded persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.485" offset="4971912">The moderately retarded, the severely retarded, and the profoundly retarded are, of course, the subgroups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.608" offset="5004408">Both the manifestations of retardation and the level of care required by each group vary to extremes ranging from requiring full-time institutionalization to those who are not even discernible on casual contact, which, incidentally, constitutes the overwhelming majority of mentally retarded persons, yet the Fifth Circuit has lumped them all together in one class, the mentally retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.277" offset="5119138">By definition, the needs and capacities of the mentally retarded are different from each other and from the rest of society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.133" offset="5154560">Unlike other suspect or quasi-suspect groups such as racial minorities, women, aliens, and those of illegitimate birth, whose stereotyped characteristics are not reflective of their true ability to perform or contribute to society, the mentally retarded characteristics do reflect an actual disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.181" offset="5258736">This relationship between the stereotyped disability and the actual ability to perform was formalized by this Court in Frontiero versus Richardson, and has become the threshold entry into a determination of suspectness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.012" offset="5342014">Classifications based on age in Massachusetts Retirement versus Murgia and mental illness in Doe versus Colautte have been rejected as suspect on this basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.422" offset="5399693">The true novelty of the Fifth Circuit opinion in addition to a determination that the mentally retarded are a quasi-suspect class is in having done so contrary to and by completely ignoring the threshold inquiry and then requiring application of the heightened scrutiny applicable to gender and legitimacy to legislation involving the mentally retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.072" offset="5506272">Under the Fifth Circuit requirements, the mentally retarded are in what is actually a no-win situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.326" offset="5531245">Since their needs are different from the rest of society, government can only address those needs by establishing classifications based on mental retardation and providing differing benefits, and yet the classification itself will fail if it is only rational and the government is then precluded from bestowing a benefit based on the classification, and the Solicitor General's brief deals with that at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.197" offset="5654752">Heightened scrutiny is not the answer to the problems of mentally retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.951" offset="5677740">The legislative approach, if left unhampered, will provide for the needs of the mentally retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.755" offset="5705012">It is doing so now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.957" offset="5713789">Heightened scrutiny is particularly inappropriate for a zoning ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.360" offset="5735418">This Court has established a long history, commencing with Village of Euclid versus Amber Realty through its recent decisions in cases like Village of Belle Terre versus Boraas and its recent decision by Mr. Justice Stevens in Members of the City of Los Angeles versus Taxpayers for Vincent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.393" offset="5827578">In each of these the Court applied the rational basis test to zoning classifications, and that has generally been done unless the ordinance was racially exclusive.</text>

            <text syncTime="2551.156" offset="10338612">I think it would be very supportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.892" offset="10353554">And I think it is true that there is a substantial relation between any discriminations, if you want to call it that, drawn in, say, the Special Education Act, that there is a substantial relationship between that and an important governmental interest of providing an appropriate education program for mentally retarded people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.987" offset="10425965">I think that there are many fewer laws that discriminate on the basis of mental retardation than might at first blush appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.611" offset="10472463">Quite often people think that guardianship laws, sterilization laws, commitment laws all necessarily discriminate on the basis of mental retardation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.637" offset="10524499">While some do, the more modern statutes clearly do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.239" offset="10538919">They address neutral criteria and neutral traits that are not tied to mental retardation in and of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.095" offset="10570370">They recognize what the city here did not recognize, and that is that there are individual differences within the group of people who are mentally retarded.</text>

            <text syncTime="2619.534" offset="10612166">It may very well turn out that some require commitment, but it is not because of their mental retardation that they require commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.973" offset="10645916">It is because of other aspects that happen to fall in with the fact that they are mentally retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.579" offset="10676323">So, I think it is overstating matters to think that a whole host of statutes would be subject to invalidation under this approach.</text>

            <text syncTime="3484.188" offset="14070778">Now, Texas has a statute which affirmatively protects the rights of mentally retarded.</text>

            <text syncTime="3517.825" offset="14205257">And the two attorneys that represented the plaintiffs in this lawsuit, Mr. Hicks and his associate, are now both with the Attorney General's office, and the other one signed... who was with them, with that office at the time of trial signed the brief, the Attorney General's brief.</text>
