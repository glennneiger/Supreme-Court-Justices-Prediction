            <text syncTime="13.389" offset="183494">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, it is our contention that Mr. Ruefenacht's right to veto every major company decision is joint management of the Continental business in which he repeatedly referred to himself as a partner and the fact that this was an entirely private transaction unique between two individuals which in no sense involved a public capital market, that these collective factors require the conclusion that in substance this was the purchase of a one-half interest in a business, and that the transfer of stock was merely incidental to the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.931" offset="341691">We submit that the federal securities laws were never meant to cover this kind of a transaction, and that Mr. Ruefenacht's claims of fraud belong in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.389" offset="379517">As authority for our position, Your Honors, we rely fundamentally upon the legislative history of the federal securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.577" offset="416297">Now, it is true, as was pointed out this morning, that the legislative history does not specifically address the sale of business situation, and indeed both factions in the current judicial debate acknowledge that Congress never specifically considered the sale of business question.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.289" offset="487141">However, the legislative history is replete with an unmistakeable Congressional emphasis upon the goals that the securities laws do seek to achieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.264" offset="531027">Those goals, reaffirmed in the legislative history as recently as 1982, and as expressed by this Court in Forman fundamentally were to protect the integrity of public capital markets and to protect investors dealing in those markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.773" offset="592989">Now, the legislative history also indicates that these goals emerged from a Congressional recognition that the dispersion of corporate ownership had led to abuses in the capital markets where people who ran corporations were taking advantage of people who owned corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.537" offset="676059">Most importantly, Your Honors, it was recognized by Congress that the effects of such abuses transcend the individual's loss, but rather chill investment and capital formation generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.212" offset="734782">It was also recognized by Congress that such abuses could be perpetrated because the owners of corporations did not have managerial control over the operations of those corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.122" offset="798416">The owners held the symbols of ownership but had no ability effectively to influence the destiny of their investment or to influence the operations or the profitability of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.180" offset="846691">There is nothing, not one word in the legislative history about protecting someone like Mr. Max Ruefenacht, who engaged in a purely private transaction, unique, as I said, between two individuals which indeed involved stock which could not have been publicly traded because it did not have a common or equivalent value to most people.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.339" offset="1635275">Well, Your Honor, there is no established rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.875" offset="1649486">That is, I believe, one of the reasons that we are here today, because there is confusion, but on this point of public versus private, I would like to raise and bring to the Court's attention the Superintendent of Insurance case, which has been cited by my opponents all throughout this litigation as standing for the proposition that private transactions are covered by the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.972" offset="1737779">It is true, as Justice Douglas pointed out there, that that was a private transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.310" offset="1763171">However, there was an important public element to that transaction, which was that the securities that were sold in that case were Treasury bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.583" offset="1800264">These were securities that were, if not being publicly traded at that time, were certainly of a common or equivalent value to most people, and therefore could have been publicly traded, and therein, I submit to the Court, lies an important public interest in that private transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.628" offset="1872467">Now, we submit, Your Honor, that there is nothing in the legislative history indicating a desire to protect someone like Mr. Ruefenacht, who, as I said, engaged in a purely private transaction, idiosyncratic, as between two individuals, which involves no public capital market.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.423" offset="1943624">There is nothing in the legislative history indicating a desire to protect Mr. Ruefenacht, who jointly managed this company, and who was no more dependent upon others in this business than one partner is dependent upon another partner to use his or her best efforts and inimitable talents to make a business a success.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.837" offset="2025335">Indeed, may I point out to the Court that there was no one in this business who had more control over profitability than Mr. Ruefenacht, and I specifically point to Magistrate Peretti's findings on the fact that Mr. Ruefenacht's veto powers extended not just to questions of capital structure of this company, such as the issuance or transfer of shares, but also to operational decisions going right to the heart of what this company's business was, namely, questions of borrowing money and of the taking on of new product lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.158" offset="2162531">We submit that this Court in evaluating this transaction under the securities laws cannot ignore Congress's goals simply because there was stock involved in the transaction, but in effect that is just what the Third Circuit did by looking only to the characteristics of the stock and ignoring all of the findings found by the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.757" offset="2253019">We don't believe that the literal or mechanical approach taken by the Third Circuit was ever intended by Congress in the application of the federal securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.397" offset="2295546">The legislative history urges flexibility in application of the securities laws, but does not say that the Court shall be flexible only where the result will be to extend coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.539" offset="2344134">Also, the context clauses, whether they be viewed as relating to the economic context of the transaction, as we believe this Court clearly held in the Weaver case, or as relating to the linguistic context of the statute, as the Third Circuit said, in either of them, I submit to the Court that the context clauses amount to Congressional caveats against literalism and amount to a sufficient basis for the District Court looking into the economic realities of this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.343" offset="2475268">Finally, as we read this Court's decisions from Joiner through Weaver, the Court has never taken a literal or mechanical approach to the securities laws, but rather has repeatedly cautioned against just such an approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.286" offset="2535037">Now, I submit, Your Honors, that the flaws in the Third Circuit's approach to the securities laws are perhaps put best in focus when one considers application of the securities laws to transactions in notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.029" offset="2598044">Under a literal approach, all note transactions would be covered including mortgage notes executed in connection with the purchase of a single family residence, and also including notes executed in connection with consumer financing transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.157" offset="2666589">But both sides of the current judicial debate, including such eloquent proponents of the literal approach as Judge Friendly and Judge Gibbons below, both sides acknowledge that Congress just could not have meant to cover those kinds of transactions, and as a result both sides, with some variations, employ a case by case analysis in the note context to determine which note transactions implicate federal securities laws concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.080" offset="2802217">I submit to the Court that the very same type of case by case analysis is just as essential in the stock area for the very same reasons, namely, to avoid sweeping within the coverage of the federal securities laws a multitude of cases which involve no significant federal concern but which happen to involve stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.243" offset="2890929">One of the concerns which led the Third Circuit to rule as it did was what can be called the line drawing concern, a concern by Judge Gibbons about distinguishing covered transactions from non-covered transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.686" offset="2952682">I submit to the Court that that concern can be greatly ameliorated by the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.859" offset="2985388">A narrow holding here that Mr. Ruefenacht's absolute veto powers, joint management, and the fact that this was a unique transaction, that those factors require a conclusion that this was not a federal securities transaction--</text>

            <text syncTime="1229.839" offset="5049270">--Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.405" offset="5051569">Frankly, I can't distinguish that conceptually from a tender offer situation, because when you are dealing in public markets, you get so much to the heart of what Congress was talking about in the securities laws that I think the securities laws do apply in Your Honor's hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.182" offset="5114681">Now, to address some of the concerns of the Court below, one concern was that application of the so-called sale of business doctrine would lead to anomalous results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.091" offset="5166299">But may I point out to the Court that the Third Circuit did not find that it would be anomalous in this case or inconsistent with the legislative goals in this case to disqualify the transaction from coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.082" offset="5218230">Admittedly, there have been raised in the briefs and in the academic commentary a great number of very perplexing factual issues, and we don't purport to address all hypothetical cases today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.076" offset="5274237">What we do ask the Court for is a ruling on this case, which we believe will set forth clearly the applicable principles, and the so-called anomalous cases we believe will in large measure take care of themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.733" offset="5328885">Also, the Court below was concerned about devoting federal judicial resources to the economic substance inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.893" offset="5377473">Now, it is true that in this case we have a two-day non-jury hearing before the magistrate devoted to the issue of control, but the projected trial time that was saved by that inquiry was far greater than two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.919" offset="5445600">Now, I cannot prove this, Your Honors, but I submit to you that the vast majority of questions of coverage under the securities laws will be clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.543" offset="5484157">Securities involved in organized exchanges, public capital markets, widespread solicitations or offerings or purchases, those cases, in my view, are clearly covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.284" offset="5535043">Where there is a legitimate issue concerning federal securities laws coverage, which I submit will occur most frequently in the private sphere, I submit that the resources devoted to that inquiry are well worth the savings in federal trial time otherwise devoted to questions or matters which involve no significant federal concern, but which happen to involve stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.101" offset="5642354">Finally, as I started to say earlier, the Third Circuit was mightily concerned about where to draw the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.857" offset="5681329">Justice Stevens' hypotheticals put that concern greatly in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.475" offset="5695853">That is a concern which, as I said, I hope this case will help to ameliorate, but I don't believe that simply by adopting a mechanical test which makes line drawing very easy is the answer to that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.152" offset="5762517">In conclusion, Your Honors, we ask this Court to decide this case based upon the facts of this case, as the District Court did, and not based upon hypothesized concerns in other cases which in a fundamental sense led the Third Circuit to rule as it did.</text>

            <text syncTime="1461.334" offset="5975259">As we pointed out, the federal courts seem to be very confused about what is a common venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.321" offset="5995216">I submit to you that there was no common venture in this case, and as authority for that position I rely upon Howey and I rely upon Weaver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.046" offset="6046103">I point out to you that in the Howey case where the common venture requirement was framed, the matter involved 42 purchasers out of a solicitation of several hundred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.073" offset="6098243">I point out to you that in the Weaver case, in Chief Justice Burger's opinion, there was great emphasis at the end of the opinion on the fact that there was a privately negotiated, face-to-face transaction unique as between two individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.832" offset="6157280">I suggest to you that juxtaposing those two cases leads to the conclusion that where you have, as in this case, a completely unique transaction between two privately contracting parties, that that is not the kind of common venture that this Court has been addressing over the last 40 years, and we therefore ask the Court based upon the facts of this case and not upon hypothesized concern or the single fact relied upon by the Third Circuit, which essentially was that there was stock involved in this transaction, we ask the Court to reverse the Court below.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter Steven Pearlman</label>
            <text syncTime="1549.409" offset="6327598">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, on behalf of Max Ruefenacht, the purchaser of one-half of the shares of traditional common stock of Continental Import and Export, Inc., I submit that to accept the sale of business doctrine will require this Court to disregard accepted principles of statutory construction by ignoring the specific and unambiguous language of the securities statutes, abandon its own prior precedent and policy, and to adopt a policy which is ambiguous, unworkable, not readily definable, and which creates results which are arbitrary and unfair in the extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.788" offset="6509097">For 50 years, and through numerous securities cases, the question of whether the federal securities laws apply to traditional common stock has not troubled this Court, nor should it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.517" offset="6584016">Nonetheless, Mr. Ruefenacht has devoted the last four years of his life to litigating just that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.040" offset="6622155">The legislation which is in issue here is the definitional section of both the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.181" offset="6670638">In both circumstances, the legislation says clearly that a security is defined as a list of items including specifically "stock".</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.790" offset="6729153">This Court does not sit as a superlegislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.594" offset="6748274">It is not up to this Court or any court to determine whether Congress was wise in enacting such a definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.265" offset="6778994">The term "stock" in the statute is clear and unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.438" offset="6807729">It is to be given its ordinary clear meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.890" offset="6825492">Under those prescriptions, the shares which Mr. Ruefenacht purchased, albeit a private, non-publicly traded corporation, were shares of stock, and he is entitled to remedies under the federal securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.017" offset="6898008">Petitioner submits that we must depart from the letter of the statute, that we must ignore its plain meaning, and that we must examine the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.146" offset="6966553">The perceived intent of Congress, and when I say perceived, I mean petitioner's perceived intent of Congress, to determine what they really meant when they gave a very clear and unambiguous definition in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.656" offset="7024545">The simple introductory answer to that is that it is not up to a Court to examine legislative history when the statute on its face is clear, but even an examination of the legislative history does not avail petitioner in the way in which he wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.069" offset="7102181">The legislative history itself does not evince any intent to exclude transactions such as that to which Mr. Ruefenacht and Mr. Bunkle entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.627" offset="7152441">Quite the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.977" offset="7157874">This Court in its prior precedent has uniformly stated that instruments which answer to the name of stock, which are stock, which bear the traditional attributes of stock, are securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.409" offset="7247631">This Court has said it in Joiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.259" offset="7254945">This Court has said it in Tcherepnin, in Forman, and most recently in Weaver, where this Court stated that the statutory definition of a security excludes only currency and notes with a maturity of less than nine months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.489" offset="7327879">It includes ordinary stocks and bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.608" offset="7340418">Nothing could be more ordinary than the stock and the bonds which Mr. Ruefenacht acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.445" offset="7371765">Petitioner submits that the respondent is attempting to engraft into the statute something which is not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.771" offset="7420979">Just the opposite is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.640" offset="7432473">We are dealing here today with a situation where the statute says plainly any stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.829" offset="7469254">Mr. Ruefenacht acquired stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.798" offset="7481166">In fact, the attempt to toss out all other portions of the definition other than that of investment contract not only violates almost every relevant concept of legislative interpretation, but makes no sense from a general common sense standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.694" offset="7572699">When this Supreme Court enunciated its opinion in Howey, it specifically dealt with the case involving an investment contract, and it said that the definition of an investment contract is investment of money in a common enterprise, expectation of profits to come from the efforts of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.875" offset="7653469">Since then, this Court has used that definition on many occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.529" offset="7676039">And on every single such occasion it has been used to define an investment contract, to see whether a particular transaction qualified as an investment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.819" offset="7725254">This Court has never applied that standard to determine whether traditional common stock was a security, nor should it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1954.739" offset="7948862">Justice Rehnquist, I don't believe that it is necessary to make these differentiations with respect to notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.227" offset="7974880">I do not believe that we should sit down and try and determine what "notes" should be included within the statutory definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.766" offset="8013019">I believe that the statutory definition specifically excludes certain types of notes, notes with a maturity of less than nine months, but I do not believe that the statutory definition of notes permits an examination into the underlying transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.311" offset="8079161">I would suggest, however, that to the extent that there is some confusion with respect to notes, it may be that notes are a less commonly defined term than stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.720" offset="8140810">"Investment contract" is a vague term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.756" offset="8148960">It is a term to which this Court has applied a certain definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.660" offset="8168604">Stock is something which is, I think Professor Lewis has said, so quintessentially a security as to foreclose further analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.599" offset="8208310">It may be that notes fall somewhere in between, and it may be, although I disagree, and of course, as I said, the case is not here today, but it may be that with respect to notes, it is somewhat less specific than stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.656" offset="8260555">It is perhaps somewhat vaguer and more akin to an investment contract, although not necessarily with the same standard to be applied, and it may be that some definition is necessary with respect to note, just what a note is, what type of note we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.301" offset="8323144">But there is no definition which is necessary with respect to traditional stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.170" offset="8342579">Stock has been defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.522" offset="8351984">At least what this Court means by stock was defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.074" offset="8366194">It was defined in Tcherepnin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.074" offset="8370269">It was defined further in Forman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.507" offset="8379987">So I do not believe that whatever problems may have arisen in the circuit with respect to notes need cause a problem with respect to whether or not this Court should adopt or reject the sale of business doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.750" offset="8432963">Until I came here or until I read the briefs, I should say, in connection with this appeal and then was reinforced a little bit this morning and then this afternoon by Mr. Epstein, I really thought I understood what the sale of business doctrine was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.759" offset="8488970">I thought the sale of business doctrine was that you looked to the economic realities of the transaction and apply the Howey test to see whether you fall into that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.180" offset="8522615">I always felt it was impossible to really come to any sort of a meaningful conclusion by use of the Howey test because it necessarily excluded certain things which no one had ever questioned were security, such as Williams Act cases, such as many publicly traded transactions, because obviously frequently when a tender offer is made, there is the intent to control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.016" offset="8630031">That is one of the major purposes for the tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.066" offset="8638181">I now find out this morning that the Howey test is not the sale of business doctrine, or vice versa, because apparently under the version of the sale of business doctrine which I heard today, you applied the Howey test sometimes, but sometimes you don't apply the Howey test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.311" offset="8707144">Certainly you don't apply it when you are dealing with publicly traded corporations, I guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.363" offset="8723445">At least in a tender offer with publicly traded corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.000" offset="8737969">I am not sure where the line is drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.484" offset="8743925">There you have to look to some other sort of legislative philosophy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.219" offset="8758867">I am not sure what that philosophy is or is supposed to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.821" offset="8769211">But what you do is, you sit down and you look at the Congressional intent, I guess, every time a securities case comes to court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2287.336" offset="9279331">There are a number of policy considerations which favor the rejection of the so-called sale of business doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.792" offset="9313081">The primary, and the one that first comes to ind, is the fact that the Securities Acts are to be construed liberally to enhance their remedial intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.767" offset="9356966">Certainly attempting to strike from the definition something which is clearly there, something which is unambiguously there does much damage to and doesn't benefit in any way the remedial intent of the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.026" offset="9414018">The problem with control is something which I have already discussed, and that is not only does any test which is premised on control exclude transactions which I don't think anyone would ever intend be excluded, but it is very difficult to define control, as to when the control was to be exercised, what is control under any given circumstance, and the Ruefenacht case illustrates that, I think, rather well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.077" offset="9518299">There has been some suggestion that when a person acquires control they don't really need the protection of the federal securities laws, because they have the ability to control the destiny of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.317" offset="9575246">I suppose the simple answer to that is that the federal securities laws apply to fraud which took place before you assumed your control, and about the best you can do once you have assumed this control whatever it is, is to be in a good position to grab the bucket and start bailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.500" offset="9659987">It hardly is a good justification, however, for adopting the control standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.820" offset="9685273">I suggest therefore that this Court reject the sale of business doctrine as it is carved out of whole cloth, having taken... having made an attempt to add to the statute something which was never there in the first place by arguments which have no basis in logic and no basis in law, and affirm what I think my counsel that took the same position as I take today in Landreth this morning described as the scholarly opinion of Judge Gibbons of the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.985" offset="9877848">I consider it well reasoned, and I wholeheartedly hope and expect that this Court will agree.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel L. Goelzer</label>
            <text syncTime="2460.916" offset="9973561">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.285" offset="9979099">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in defining what is a security, Congress used the plain term "stock", and the stock in this case is the garden variety of that type of instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.510" offset="10035941">Nowhere in the Securities Act or in the Securities Exchange Act did Congress suggest that sales of this sort of ordinary stock were ever to be excluded from the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.833" offset="10081290">The petitioners' case rests in part on the notion that only passive public investors were intended to enjoy the protection of the securities laws, that those who engaged in private negotiated transactions where they have some ability presumably to extract information for themselves are not within the protection of the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.801" offset="10181182">But Congress, I think, considered that issue and reached a different conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.103" offset="10202393">Section 4 of the Securities Act of 1933 contains exemptions from the registration provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.327" offset="10243249">Almost 30 years ago, in SEC versus Ralston Purina, this Court construed the private placement exemption as excluding from registration and its disclosure obligations transactions where the purchaser can fend for himself or have obtained his own access to the sort of information that registration would supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.110" offset="10342410">Congress made clear in the introductory phrase to Section 4 that transactions excluded from registration were included in antifraud protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.234" offset="10386922">I think the arguments that petitioner makes here in this regard were simply considered by Congress, and the place it drew the line was between registration and antifraud protection, not by excluding these private transactions from the scope of the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.862" offset="10457348">Petitioner argues that ordinary common stock is not stock at all when it changes hands in a transaction where the buyer acquires some measure of control over the issuing company, but if this Court were to adopt that theory, it would multiply the complexity and expense of both SEC and private securities litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.145" offset="10554524">I would like to consider Commission litigation first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.214" offset="10570824">Under the test the petitioner advocates, Commission enforcement actions would necessarily become more complex for reasons having little or nothing to do with Congress's objectives in enacting the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.939" offset="10625682">Petitioner argues in essence that every time a judge is confronted with a securities transaction, he needs to make his or her own decision concerning whether Congress intended federal protection to apply to that transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.049" offset="10686181">Thus even if the Commission were to prove that a violation had occurred under the ordinary meaning of the laws, would still be open to the defendant trying to convince the Court that there was something in Congress's spirit or intent not manifested in the words which provided a defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2689.916" offset="10889623">The Commission would not typically bring an enforcement action in a case involving a transaction between two private parties simply because it wouldn't be a good use of our resources, although--</text>

            <text syncTime="2756.509" offset="11155967">--Well, as I would with stock, I would begin with the literal term of the statute, and start with a presumption that any note is included within the scope of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.501" offset="11195987">The lower courts have held, and the Commission doesn't disagree with it, that there are certain families, certain categories of notes that were not within Congress's intent that would relate primarily to notes issued in commercial transactions, mercantile transactions to finance inventory, for example, or for consumer purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.062" offset="11274145">Other than those rather specialized exemptions or exceptions, I would say that a note is within the scope of the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.882" offset="11305492">I think it is not... the definition of security contains many terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.203" offset="11326704">Stock is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.886" offset="11329525">Note is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.822" offset="11333182">Investment contract is another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.655" offset="11340601">I think it is not surprising that each term has its own specialized meaning and its own body of case law interpreting it, but as I said earlier, in this case there is no question, no one has suggested that it is not conventional stock that is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.582" offset="11400264">I think that a second way in which Commission enforcement actions would be significantly burdened if the petitioner's position were adopted is that inherent in that position is that each security transaction must show that it meets the definition of investment contract, yet the Commission often brings actions that involve instruments that don't promise a share of profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.517" offset="11511964">Rather, they promise a fixed return to the investor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.053" offset="11526175">The lower courts have disagreed concerning whether a fixed return meets the profit element of the Howey test, yet if it doesn't, such ordinary things as long-term corporate bonds issued by blue chip companies would be excluded along with irregular and unusual instruments issued by individual promoters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.299" offset="11611125">At best, the Commission would be forced to relitigate all of this ground, presumably already covered during the past 50 years under the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.922" offset="11645606">I think it is also worth pointing out that the position the petitioner urges would result in arbitrary and illogical distinctions in private litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.630" offset="11688447">For example, in this case, if Mr. Ruefenacht had purchased his 50 percent interest in Continental in a series of five transactions of 10 percent each, presumably the first four would form a basis for federal litigation, the last would not, or if in the same transaction in which Mr. Ruefenacht purchased, his brother had purchased 5 percent of the stock based on the same representations that were made to Mr. Ruefenacht, the brother would apparently have a cause of action, Mr. Ruefenacht would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.684" offset="11824702">And if Mr. Ruefenacht had purchased his controlling interest from ten shareholders, each with 5 percent, apparently he would not have a cause of action against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.242" offset="11870886">Would they have a cause of action against him?</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.194" offset="11882694">They would seem to be the sort of people that Congress intended to protect, even under the petitioner's theory: passive, non-controlling investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.050" offset="11914145">Yet the petitioner says there was no securities transaction involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.752" offset="11928983">One circuit, the Seventh Circuit, has suggested that there is a securities transaction for the sellers but not for the buyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.005" offset="11957926">I think that leads to a good result, and I would support it, but I think the logic of the same transaction being or not being a securities transaction depending upon whether you are plaintiff or defendant, is illusive, and the issue would undoubtedly be litigated in the lower courts and perhaps ultimately brought back to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.169" offset="12034622">Finally, I would point out that adoption of the sale of business doctrine will inject great uncertainty into business transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.758" offset="12072970">Any time that a significant amount of stock is purchased, the parties will have no definite way of knowing whether they have Possible liabilities and possible rights under the federal securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.713" offset="12112780">All that, no matter how sophisticated the advice they might get from counsel, all that will have to await litigation in the federal courts over this illusive and difficult issue of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.105" offset="12158338">Absent some clear directive from Congress that the securities laws were intended to create this sort of uncertainty, or that it is a necessary consequence of them, I think this Court should be reluctant to create it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.431" offset="12211628">For nearly 50 years, the business community, the Courts, and the Commission have taken Congress at its word and assumed that any purchase or sale of ordinary corporate securities, whether... corporate stock, whether between sophisticated or unsophisticated parties, was within the antifraud protections of the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.361" offset="12299399">If petitioners or others believe now that that determination should be changed, they should address their arguments to the Congress, not the Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.056" offset="12366168">I first would like to address Justice O'Connor's question about what will the result in this case do to the workload of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.329" offset="12399291">This is, of course, theoretical, but I submit to the Court that especially with the increased awareness among practitioners of this issue, that if the sale of business concept is rejected, that plaintiff's lawyers will be constrained to bring all cases that in any tangential way involve stock and an allegation of fraud in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.611" offset="12496362">Plaintiff's lawyers, I submit, would be remiss if not negligent in failing to bring those cases in federal court so as to take full advantage of the easier burden of proof under the federal securities laws and of the broader privity requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.371" offset="12559474">Secondly, a great deal has been made about the so-called structure of the securities laws and how that supposedly indicates a Congressional intent on the sale of business question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.296" offset="12611092">I submit that is an incorrect argument for the simple reason that both sides of the current debate recognize that Congress never considered this question, and if Congress never considered this question, I think that the better place to look for the Congressional intent is not to the structure of the Acts but to the legislative history of the Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.842" offset="12685280">Finally, the point has been made that control or the passing of control should have no relevance because fraud very often takes place before control passes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.352" offset="12743376">Well, there are several answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.386" offset="12751526">Answer Number One is that as Congress saw it, the dependance of the investor defines whether he was the kind of person that should receive protection of the securities laws, and the passage of control defines whether the individual was dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.313" offset="12819236">Secondly, in the investment contract context, in the Howey case context, I think all sides recognize that the control analysis is very important to the third prong of the Howey test, and it is important because it gives courts a pathway to the legislative intent and a means to evaluate whether the investor involved in a particular case is in that peculiarly vulnerable position which Congress sought to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.348" offset="12939295">Thank you, Your Honors.</text>
