            <text syncTime="90.141" offset="490499">First, with regard to punitive damages, that issue is squarely presented by this case, whether or not they are available under ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.449" offset="535743">We contend that they are not, essentially for two reasons, that that is not what Congress said, and quite plainly, after review of the legislative history, that is not what Congress intended, and secondly, that if punitive damages were available, they would interfere with the proper functioning of the employee benefit system in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.218" offset="650786">ERISA is a long, complex, comprehensive statute, but the provisions directly involved in this case are only two, and they are relatively simple.</text>

            <text syncTime="1127.431" offset="4639684">As this Court said in the Northwest Air Lines case, where a statute is comprehensive... and ERISA is among the most comprehensive statutes... and where it provides for private remedies in some situations, and federal government remedies in other situations, that is very strong evidence that it didn't intend that additional remedies should be grafted on to a statute like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.348" offset="4751384">The review of ERISA is convincing indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.918" offset="4773640">Its civil and criminal penalties and sanctions providing for imprisonment, fines in various amounts for various kinds of conduct, one would have to conclude that Congress reviewed the subject that they had under consideration exhaustively and in great detail, and unlike some other statutes which do involve filling in the details by courts, this is not that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.850" offset="4873323">This is a very specific, very comprehensive act directed to providing minimum standards for pensioners and benefits for those entitled to them on a nationwide basis, and the emphasis is on the delivery of those benefits rather than on state tort claims which may be associated with the subject matter of earlier cases or like this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.171" offset="4998607">We contend also that punitive damages, if they were available, would have an adverse impact on the functioning of the employee benefit system and in fact, the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.962" offset="5045836">The Congress very carefully provided in the statute and by regulation promulgated by the Secretary of Labor for an appeals process in the event that a claim is denied, and that that appeals process would effectively be scrapped if the right to damages were available to those who were applying for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.960" offset="5129846">Who will go through the appeals process if he had a right to damages for emotional distress, pain and suffering, and particularly if he had a right to punitive damages on the outside?</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.600" offset="5176344">This case is probably as good an example of that as any.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.671" offset="5200690">We have talked about the remedial aspect of the statute and how that works with the individual rights provided under Section 502 and the plan rights provided in Section 409.</text>

            <text syncTime="1311.133" offset="5374456">ERISA was enacted to protect participants from actions of the small percentage of fiduciaries who were not acting in good faith and were not providing the benefits that participants were rightfully entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.226" offset="5434851">Respondent at this time does not request the Court to imply remedies into ERISA but to interpret the language that is in ERISA right now in light of looking at the legislative history, the legislative language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.337" offset="5503292">It is the traditional role of this Court to analyze the statute, and that's what I wish to do for you at this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.925" offset="5533699">In the purpose of ERISA, it indicates that ERISA was created to protect participants and to provide appropriate remedies, sanctions and ready access to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.585" offset="5588347">The legislative history of both the House and the Senate is unambiguous and quite clear, and it states that the enforcement provisions were created and specifically designed to provide broad remedies for participants to redress or prevent violations of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.383" offset="5679462">It then goes on and says it is the Committee's intent to provide the full range of legal and equitable remedies, and in both... available both in state and federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.226" offset="5742887">Now, at the time that this specific legislative intent created a full range of legal and equitable remedies for participants, it was quite clear that compensatory and punitive damages were part of the full range of legal remedies available to participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.687" offset="5816657">The Section 502... excuse me... (a)(2) language which refers over to Section 409 allows participants equitable or remedial relief as the Court deems appropriate, and this is for breaches of fiduciary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.668" offset="5892621">Traditionally, breaches of fiduciary duty are a tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.120" offset="5910489">It is not founded in trust law, but a breach of fiduciary duty is a tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.441" offset="5931700">If you look at the ERISA the way it is set up, Section 502 provides for remedies against the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.147" offset="5966496">Section 409 sets forth the tort remedies against the fiduciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.700" offset="5992722">The preemption which totally occupied the field and removed many tort remedies, intentional torts as well as breach of fiduciary duty torts, completely wiped the slate clean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.976" offset="6053849">It would be anomalous at this particular point to so narrowly construe Section 409 as to not provide the teeth in ERISA necessary to fill that void, that preemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.338" offset="6347361">You have got some checks and balances and safeguards there that themselves would immunize the fiduciaries from punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.713" offset="6388843">It is also interesting to note that in the context where we are right now, that the administration of welfare plans under Section 405(c)(1) and (2), these fiduciaries may allocate their responsibilities and obligations for nontrust asset type decisions, and if they adequately in fact do delegate their authority, they are immune from liability, so that trustees who are sitting on the plans to make sure that the trust assets are being governed and that the policies themselves are being established properly, they will not be affected unless they are in there actually working on a day-to-day basis exhibiting discretion as to whether or not a participant should or should not receive a benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.729" offset="6588837">So those obligations can be delegated to professionals who, just like insurance, and it is interesting to note that the... any participant who happens to be receiving benefits pursuant to an insurance administered plan, do have the full range of remedies in state law for their protection, compensatory damages, punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.630" offset="6692491">The particular situation we are in right now is a self-funded, self-administered plan that if the benefits are not paid, the direct benefit accrues to the employer who is administering the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="3125.460" offset="12631795">Congress essentially said that the fiduciary standard embodied in federal legislation is considered desirable because it will bring a measure of uniformity in an area where decisions under the same set of facts may vary from state to state.</text>

            <text syncTime="3200.008" offset="12930009">It says that the Court has broad discretion in awarding equitable relief to make the plan whole, and I think that responds to what happens if the fiduciary takes something and goes away, and whether you call it damages or not is an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.254" offset="13010989">I think that ERISA, it would be regarded as equitable relief as distinguished from damages, but the effect of it would be to restore the plan, to make the plan whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.610" offset="13052367">There have been a few cases that have gone the other way on our issue, by our count, about a half a dozen, and fifteen resolve it the way we recommend to the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3247.672" offset="13120598">They all take the same line from the legislative history, the line that refers to the full range of legal and equitable relief, and which is repeated in the House and Senate reports, and they use that as the basis for the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.948" offset="13185800">We would suggest that that is an insubstantial basis, particularly where the bill was amended going through, and that reference which may have been accurate when the legislative history was written, was stripped from the bill before it was enacted, and there is in the present bill no reference at all to legal relief, and we would suggest therefore no reference at all to the kind of damages relief raised by Respondents here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.768" offset="13296977">Justice O'Connor had a question about 502(a)(3), would it give participants or beneficiaries a right against fiduciaries.</text>
