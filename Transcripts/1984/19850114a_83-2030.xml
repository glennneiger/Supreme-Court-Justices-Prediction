            <text syncTime="646.020" offset="2729555">Fourth, the board will then proceed to maintain that teacher interests in advocating the specified crime of homosexual sodomy may, and again this is central to the analysis this statute, may on a case by case basis he outweighed by the interests in effective public education described above.</text>

            <text syncTime="1040.473" offset="4307351">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.642" offset="4319994">In order to just briefly wrap up the point about state interests involved here, the third and, I think, one which is crucial to the resolution of this case also is providing an appropriate introduction to traditional, fundamental cultural values, and we think that is no less of a significant value of public education than the academic education side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.936" offset="4393241">The Court has recognized, for example, this Court, in Pico that students must be assisted in adjusting normally to their environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.459" offset="4423334">They must have traditional, fundamental cultural values promoted, and this Court has continuously respected the significance of that interest, and has also recognized that the duty to promote traditional fundamental cultural values extends whether those... I am quoting from this Court's opinion in Pico...</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.135" offset="4486028">"be they social, moral, or political. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.087" offset="4493865">We think that is a crucial state interest involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.437" offset="4503269">And then, finally, given the fact that the state is acting in loco parentis in taking charge of students for specified times in each day... 92 percent of students do so attend... we think there is also an additional duty there to provide for the psychological as well as the pyhsical welfare of children which are in its custody pursuant to the in loco parentis doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.084" offset="4581845">We think cumulatively these interests are compelling, though they need not be under the Pickering balancing approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.238" offset="4602430">With these goals in mind, the Court has, of course, adopted a balancing standard of review ever since the landmark watershed opinion in Pickering in 1968, nor, we would submit, pursuant to the Pickering balancing approach, are state and teacher interests the only interests to be weighed in the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.985" offset="4681424">We would further submit that student interests of the sort recognized by this Court in Ginsberg, Ferber, and FCC versus Pacifica Foundation, should be weighed in the Pickering balance as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.190" offset="4722280">We would further suggest, and the Gay Task Force certainly has suggested a virtually limitless marketplace of ideas approach to be applied pursuant to its analysis of First Amendment teacher speech rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.081" offset="4769822">However, the board of education would submit that teachers may have restrictions placed on their speech, as was recognized, not specifically, but analogously in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.706" offset="4816320">The Court, for example, noted in Ginsberg that a state may permissibly determine that at least in some areas a child, like someone in a captive audience, is not possessed of that full capacity for individual choice which is the presupposition of First Amendment guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.715" offset="4876298">The board of education therefore submits that the Pickering approach and not the impressionistic and incomplete approach adopted by the Tenth Circuit majority below should guide analysis in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.892" offset="4929065">The Gay Task Force has suggested an absolute principle of viewpoint neutrality to be applied under all circumstances and in all contexts, including teacher speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.164" offset="4966159">The board of education submits that this promise is overextended in light of the crucial value orientation function which public schools and public school teachers, who obviously act as role models to impressionable youth, are called upon to fulfill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.139" offset="5022061">In the educational context, we would submit, the premise is overextended, although viewpoint neutrality as a general premise is certainly legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.761" offset="5056542">We would pose a couple of hypotheticals at this juncture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.029" offset="5065633">For example, let's suppose that the State of Oklahoma hypothetically passed a statute precluding teachers from advocating the use of heroine, which is also a felony in the State of Oklahoma, as is criminal sodomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.754" offset="5112444">We certainly would suggest that viewpoint neutrality would not suggest that because viewpoints antithetical to heroine use could be presented, that therefore viewpoint neutrality would also mean that viewpoints favorable to it should be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.781" offset="5172631">This might conceivably be extended in other circumstances even past criminal conduct, but of course the Court would not need to go that far, but for example let's suppose we had another Oklahoma statute in which the court, for example, or in which the legislature decided that teachers should not be permitted to advocate racial bigotry in public in a way which is likely to come to the attention of the students.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.729" offset="5268343">Clearly racial bigotry is not criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.164" offset="5278165">This statute involves criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.116" offset="5285898">But we certainly think viewpoint neutrality would not go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.485" offset="5299377">Consequently, we assert that that premise is simply overextended as applied to teacher speech in public education, especially when the nexus factors and the appropriate hearings would permit the determinations to be made on a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.793" offset="5352666">Pursuant to the applicable Pickering balancing standard of review, the Oklahoma legislature has elected to regulate not a flat ban, as is asserted by the Gay Task Force, the manner in which public school teachers advocate the specified crime of homosexual sodomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.123" offset="5429989">The statute, we would submit, in terms of its nexus factors, is as narrowly drawn as can reasonably be expected without the necessity of writing another Napoelonic Code, given the breadth of the interests in effective public education, given the need on a case by case basis to determine whether in a particular case there has been a material or substantial disruption in the educational process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1352.844" offset="5556840">Point well taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.114" offset="5585888">Perhaps the United States Code would be a better example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.466" offset="5603338">In short, we would submit, pursuant to this analysis, that the target clearly... that the statute does clearly target the aforementioned goals of producing effective public education, making sure that student morality is not corrupted, ensuring that the students are protected in their psychological as well as physical well-being and that the obligations of citizenship, which include the obligation to obey the law, and we might again parenthetically point out here what is essentially asserted by the Gay Task Force is that the laws against criminal homosexual sodomy are uncommonly silly laws, but certainly one of the obligations of citizenship is to obey the law whether the law is uncommonly silly or not, provided that the right of core political speech to advocate that the law should be changed is preserved, and we would submit that that is in fact preserved under the instant statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.667" offset="5812108">We would next assert that teacher interests may on a case by case basis be outweighed by interests of the state, of parental rights, and of the students themselves of the privacy nature that we have just described, and again, we would assert that clearly the statute does not overbroadly preclude teachers from advocating legislative change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.050" offset="5909702">The Gay Task Force has asserted that joining the National Democratic Party might somehow indirectly encourage or promote criminal sodomy because the National Democratic Party does have a plank which does advocate the decriminalization of any forms of homosexual activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.411" offset="5979083">We think that that reading of the statute is simply not a fair reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.165" offset="5998100">We think that that reading of the statute attempts to insert the word "indirectly" prior to the words "indirectly advocating", or "indirectly promoting", or "indirectly encouraging".</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.271" offset="6034567">We don't think that's a fair reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.987" offset="6041463">We don't think that that's the reading that would be given to that statute should the statute ever be invoked and should the Supreme Court of Oklahoma be called upon to construe it in any context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.381" offset="6099037">The last argument I'd like to address is the argument asserted by the Gay Task Force that other viewpoint neutral alternatives may be available as less restrictive alternatives to the present system of regulation of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.556" offset="6155671">And we would attempt to first of all put this argument in context, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.175" offset="6174165">The less restrictive alternative as applied to teacher speech is not an individually dispositive first amendment standard of review when applied to teacher speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.966" offset="6213349">This Court made very clear in the Pickering decision that in fact the balancing test was to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.768" offset="6232575">The Court waxed eloquent on the dangers of mechanistic jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.470" offset="6247308">Certainly heeding that caution, the board of education would not attempt to itself fall victim to mechanistic jurisprudence by asserting that the Picketing factors are exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.528" offset="6295582">And as a result of that, the board of education would concede arguendo that the question of the availability of a less restrictive alternative should be considered, but only as a factor in applying the Picketing balancing approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.687" offset="6344170">It should not be held to be an individually dispositive criterion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.639" offset="6360053">It therefore becomes appropriate to examine the other availabilities, the other statutes, for example, the generic Oklahoma teacher fitness statute, in an attempt to ascertain whether or not activity which can clearly constitutionally be prescribed might also not be prescribed by a viewpoint neutral generic statute such as that which is in place currently in the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.838" offset="6456810">We would refer the Court to Title 70, Oklahoma Statute, 5-103, the main generic teacher fitness statute, which includes, for example, among reasons for dismissal of public school teachers, immorality, wilfull neglect of duty, incompetency, cruelty, and moral turpitude, as well as the commission of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.668" offset="6540193">Well, of course, beginning at the end, advocacy of criminal sodomy is not a felony in Oklahoma, so it certainly wouldn't come under the condition of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.726" offset="6580422">Moral turpitude case law has been somewhat obscure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.611" offset="6595886">In the case of Kelly versus City of Tulsa, for example, the criteria were given as involving an act, an offense, which is actually a crime, committed with criminal intent, and in that case the court concluded, the Oklahoma Supreme Court concluded that being a public drunk was not an act of moral turpitude since by definition it was not committed with criminal intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.341" offset="6678851">We don't think moral turpitude stretches to cover the conduct which is precluded under the instant challenged statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.928" offset="6705182">Wilfull neglect of duty has been very narrowly interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.963" offset="6721274">The Childers case, which I have cited before to the Court, talks about knowingly and purposefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.867" offset="6740918">In any case, the question of neglect of duty doesn't seem to be applicable to the challenged statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.097" offset="7549878">The issue in this case is how open that debate will be, and it was in addressing that issue that the Court of Appeals held that Oklahoma's teacher fitness law is unconstitutional, and I quote,</text>

            <text syncTime="1959.266" offset="7982570">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, however long the list, the principle for which this case, I think, ought to stand is that if one is simply expressing misgivings about the law, whether sub silentio or expressly, one should not be punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.828" offset="8044742">For example, Justice Stewart about 25 years ago in a case also involving trying to make what was then criminal activity, sex outside of marriage, appear attractive, in the case of Kingsley Pictures, made clear that the right to make what was then a crime seem perfectly normal and attractive was a form of protected advocacy every bit as much, he said, as advocacy of socialism or the single tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.613" offset="8167935">But I want to make clear that the lines they are attempting to draw, though perhaps responsive to the Chief Justice's concern, are lines not drawable at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.453" offset="8203253">It was this Court that recognized in Wrightman v. Mulkie about a decade before Oklahoma's law was passed that the repeal of any legal prohibition may be said to encourage the activity formerly prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.295" offset="8266678">So, the result is that if someone says, I am in favor of repeal of the sodomy laws, or I believe we should pass gay rights laws, that person could obviously be said to encourage homosexual activity, and that is not an abstract matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.738" offset="8324461">The abstract discussion would subject that teacher to this entire statutory scheme in which there are so many uncertainties, and what it means is concrete.</text>

            <text syncTime="2619.509" offset="10623550">But on the other hand, it was protected just to extol the virtues of unionism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.746" offset="10644448">The problem in that case and the conclusion of the Court was that when a speaker has to worry on pain of some concrete penalty if he guesses wrong whether others will take his words of praise for unionism, like Justice Brennan's example, what is so wrong with what these gay people do, whether others will take those words of praise as an impermissible encouragement to join up, then the freedom of speech is fatally abridged.</text>

            <text syncTime="2711.019" offset="10989578">He quoted a woman who said that if teachers had all that much power as role models, I would have been a nun many years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="2938.650" offset="11900102">And with respect to the record in this case, if I might go back to the idea that these nexus requirements might somehow save the law, either the way they are written or the way they might be construed if this Court were to certify the case to the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, it seems to me that the key to that is Justice White's question about whether all of these factors might somehow be collapsed into nothing through that magic word, "unfit", because if you really had to find that word, independent of the viewpoint the teacher expressed, the teacher was independently unfit to teach, in terms of general background and otherwise valid fitness rules, then of course this law would be entirely superfluous except for one important factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.131" offset="12094035">And that is that under this law there is a new basis and an important basis for chilling all speech that comes anywhere close to the line, and that is in Section 6103.3 of the statute, which is very much in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.074" offset="12153803">Whenever a superintendent of a school district has reason to believe that cause exists for dismissal, then the teacher can be suspended without even a hearing while one tries to figure out whether the teacher is unfit within the meaning of this law, and then when you look at this law, what does it tell you?</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.035" offset="12217646">It says that a teacher may be discharged if the teacher has been rendered unfit because of such conduct or activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.041" offset="12249620">Conduct is in turn defined as speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.558" offset="12259651">In other words, you can be rendered unfit simply because the point of view you express might directly or indirectly encourage homosexual activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.016" offset="12297581">Now, it is suggested by Mr. Arrow that we are somehow guilty of reading the word "indirectly" into this law to make it look broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.420" offset="12327151">On the contrary, when they were invited before the District Court to narrow the law by reading the word "directly" into it and an intent requirement into it, to eliminate the directly threatened enforcement of the law as it now stood, they declined that invitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.914" offset="12485140">I am suggesting, however, that if in this Court he tells us in response to Justice Rehnquist's question that there is no real threat of enforcement against people who merely discuss, he certainly had the power to eliminate that threat by entering into a consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.773" offset="12548565">But as Justice White points out, this law is essentially self-executing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.391" offset="12562985">They have no discretion about its enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.993" offset="12573434">If you put yourself in the position of a public school teacher in Oklahoma either before the Tenth Circuit acted or after this Court might send the case back on certification to the Oklahoma Supreme Court, and if you ask yourself, must I hedge and trim every word I utter on this controversial public subject, because otherwise I will be suspended and I might ultimately be discharged, your answer is surely yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.645" offset="12680013">That is, this law, by virtue of the threat that is on its face reinforced by the sweeping interpretation given by the Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma, this law in effect tells teachers, you had better shut up about this subject, or if you talk about it, you had better be totally hostile to homosexuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.308" offset="12758694">And the real question is whether it is consistent with the traditions of free speech and open inquiry for that lesson to be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.664" offset="12792131">You asked, Mr. Chief Justice, about the role model function of teachers, and I do take that seriously, but it seems to me that when Justice Frankfurter in 1952 talked about teachers as the high priests of our democracy, he made an important point in suggesting that one of the most important values that those teachers model is the value of open inquiry, the value of free speech and an informed citizenry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.212" offset="12894322">And even the teacher who out in society advocated some of the really more outlandish positions that might be attributed to people, not this position, which is hardly outlandish... 29 states have adopted it... but even if a teacher out in the society, in the community, said, I think that many of the laws that all you people think that are reasonable are really crazy, it is part if the lesson that teachers are to impart in this society that a teacher ought not to be silenced and fired for that.</text>
