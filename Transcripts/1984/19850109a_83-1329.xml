            <text syncTime="50.183" offset="335065">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, this case presents a relatively narrow issue, and that is whether Chapter 103 of the Code of Massachsetts Regulations, Section 430.14 fails to satisfy the due process clause because it does not require a Prison Disciplinary Board to state its reasons in the record for denying an inmate's request for witnesses at his disciplinary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.539" offset="432449">I will argue that the regulation wholly comports with due process, and that imposing the additional procedural requirement of a statement of reasons imposes unjustified burdens on the prison administration.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.197" offset="639026">The Massachusetts Department of Correction has adopted regulations governing the procedures used at prison disciplinary hearings which track, virtually word for word, this Court's holding in Wolff v. McDonnell.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.576" offset="696600">The particular regulation at issue here, Section 430.14, provides that an inmate does have a right to call witnesses at his disciplinary hearing except where that right conflicts with the prison official's interest in seeing that the hearing does not create undue hazards within the institution or otherwise undermine correctional goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.960" offset="786147">The regulation further provides that in determining whether or not to allow an inmate's request for witnesses, the board is to consider such factors as relevance, necessity, the cumulative nature of the testimony to be given, and the hazards present in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.761" offset="853334">The regulation does not require the board to state its reasons or provide support in the record for its decision to deny an inmate's request for witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.737" offset="893249">Of course, in Wolff v. McDonnell and again in Baxter v. Palmigiano, this Court rejected the notion that due process requires such a statement of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.223" offset="931179">In this case, John real who was a prisoner at the maximum security institution in Massachusetts, was charged with three violations of the Massachusetts Code of Disciplinary Offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.991" offset="978304">Those charges stem from an incident in which Mr. Real, contrary to an order of a correctional officer named John Baleyko, entered an office within the prison in which Mr. Baleyko was attempting to stop another inmate's attack on another officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.171" offset="1042983">At his disciplinary hearing, Mr. Real requested that John Balayko, the reporting officer, the officer who authored the disciplinary report, be called as a witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="634.569" offset="2672606">Certainly, if an inmate could make a prima facie showing, for example, that the prison officials were acting on a discriminatory basis with respect to their decisions, that would be a showing that prison officials were not properly exercising their discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="676.817" offset="2841566">The inquiry also has to go to, as this Court considered in Wolff, to what kinds of risks would be involved in bringing that witness into the disciplinary hearing room.</text>

            <text syncTime="747.242" offset="3123271">In Hughes, of course, an inmate had alleged that he was placed into segregation without any prior hearing whatsoever, and this Court held that that was sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.862" offset="3181785">Under subsequent case law, Helms v. Hewitt, decided by this case, it was made plain that under these circumstances, a liberty interest might be implicated and an inmate might be entitled to a bearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.643" offset="3244897">That kind of a scenario is much... the scenario where an inmate may not have a hearing where liberty interest is implicated, may not have a hearing at all, we submit is quite distinct from the situation such as this where there is no question that Mr. Real received his hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.914" offset="3313964">There is no indication that the Prison Disciplinary Board failed to follow what, on their face, were fully adequate procedures, and where this Court has indeed held that the prisoner doesn't have the right to have a statement of reasons, which is exactly the right that the Supreme Judicial Court held that he did have.</text>

            <text syncTime="830.037" offset="3454399">But it seems to me the State is going further here, and they are saying not only do we not have to supply written reasons in the administrative record at the time the hearing is conducted before the Superintendent, but if the disciplinary hearing is later challenged for revocation of good time on a violation of the constitutional rights of the prisoner, even in court we don't have to advance any reason why the Superintendent didn't allow these witnesses to be called.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.725" offset="3565158">And I think you run into a little trouble with some of the language in Wolff there.</text>

            <text syncTime="875.968" offset="3638196">We don't contest that in the individual case, in a later judicial proceeding to review the action of prison officials, that where the prisoner makes out a prima facie case that he's been denied his procedural rights, that prison officials are going to have to answer that case as they would in any other habeas corpus case or a 1983 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.543" offset="3732446">Our position is merely that where a prisoner simply goes into court and says I didn't get a witness, under this court's ruling in Wolff that's not enough because, especially under these circumstances in Massachusetts where the procedures which prison officials follow are exactly those procedures prescribed in Wolff, the Prison Disciplinary Board has that very discretion to say you can request the witness but we can deny it, and we don't have to tell you why.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.083" offset="3866611">So that it seems anomalous, just as a matter of pleading, to have a prisoner go into court and say, well, it did exactly what they're entitled to do under the Constitution and under their regulations, but I want to know more, I want them to answer me more; I want them to justify themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1120.698" offset="4617057">Furthermore, this Court has noted that in fashioning its procedural prescriptions, prescriptions required by the Constitution, it is concerned that government officials be guided by adequate procedures in the generality of cases, and not with whether, when guided by such procedures, officials make a decision with which a court might later disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.872" offset="4709739">In this case, the procedure prescribed by the Supreme Judicial Court does not really bear any relation to these principles.</text>

            <text syncTime="1251.963" offset="5142118">They relied on Hayes II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.625" offset="5152776">I forget just now whether that was Hayes v. Thompson or Hayes v. Walker, but the case that's referred to in both our brief and the Respondent's as Hayes II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.751" offset="5189243">And in that case, in that very case, exactly what happened was that in accordance with this Court's ruling in Wolff, a Prison Disciplinary Board denied a request for witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1378.215" offset="5647117">And on page 22, they said... and this is of the jurisdictional statement:</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.368" offset="5667806">"We conclude that the failure of the regulations to require some support in the record for the denial of the Plaintiff's witness has abridged his federal due process right. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.344" offset="5703646">Now, if you're talking about regulations issued by the State in the record, I presume the Supreme Judicial Court in that sense was referring to the administrative record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1401.601" offset="5740740">Yes, Your Honor, and that's exactly the portion of the opinion to which I was just referring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.983" offset="5762265">Our reading of that holding is that the Supreme Judicial Court held these regulations unconstitutional because they did not require a statement of reasons in the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.122" offset="5810748">Now, we have noted in our brief several reasons why we're most concerned about this new requirement imposed by the Supreme Judicial Court, and I would just like to highlight this afternoon one or two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.323" offset="5879607">The most serious cases, of course, are those cases in which the calling of a witness may create hazards within the institution because the witness may be subject to reprisal, generally by the charged inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.159" offset="5926941">In such cases where we have a requirement, an across-the-board requirement of a statement of reasons, the Prison Disciplinary Board is basically put into the position of trying to guess how much it can put in the record, how much must it put in the record without running the very risk that it hopes to avoid by not calling the witness in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1493.641" offset="6108858">I'm not quite certain what purpose it would serve as far as the rationale of the Supreme Judicial Court is concerned to have it otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="1537.969" offset="6286177">Furthmore, we run into a problem where we have an across-the-board rule, and the only time the inmate can't know is when, in fact, there's a risk of reprisal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.285" offset="6327450">Then the only time the inmate doesn't know is exactly... will lead to exactly the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.349" offset="6351692">That is, the arousal of the suspicions in the inmate's mind which can lead to the physical retaliation that is trying to be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.706" offset="6381158">And we submit that in fact this requirement leads to exactly that position that the Respondent himself has suggested at page 32 of his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.141" offset="6422849">That is, it puts prison officials in the position of making a decision between forgoing an otherwise proper and necessary disciplinary action within the institution or revealing sensitive information which can lead to harm within the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.352" offset="6491708">Now, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is not here to play the heavy, and we're not here to say the Constitution doesn't accompany these individuals once they step into the jailhouse door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.300" offset="6531519">But we don't believe that this Court's ruling in Wolff or in Baxter or in the recent cases of Hudson v. Palmer or Block v.

            <text syncTime="1660.579" offset="6776652">One, in dealing with these cases, we wish to stress, as Judge Friendly said in his article, some kind of hearing that we're dealing with a system of mass justice, and that prison officials in Massachusetts, for example, in 1980 had almost 7,000 disciplinary proceedings at which prisoners were entitled to the full procedural safeguards, presumably as you suggested, which would include an extended record, although that record would be confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.549" offset="6888456">Now, this may not seem like much in the context of any one disciplinary proceeding, but when you add this up you're talking about man hours and you're talking about resources that come out of other areas within the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.056" offset="6942477">I see that my time is growing short, and I do want to address the issue of mootness because I promised that I would, and I don't want to break my promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.613" offset="6988766">During the disciplinary action involved in this case, Mr. Real was in the state prison on a three t five-year sentence for possession of a sawed-off shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.531" offset="7036413">In November of 1982, the Commissioner of Correction issued a certificate of discharge from that sentence and he made the discharge effective to July 19, 1982 because of certain recalculations in good time credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.093" offset="7102660">From that date, from the July 19th date, Mr. Real was deemed to have begun serving a five-year from and after sentence imposed for a manslaughter offense he committed while in prison, killing another inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.033" offset="7162428">Now, the Respondent has suggested that this case is now moot because Mr. Real has received the certificate of discharge from the three to five-year sentence, that is, the sentence to which the good time at issue would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.982" offset="7210180">But that's clearly not the case, because if this Court were to affirm the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court, returning the 150 days good time to Mr. Real, his effective date of discharge then becomes some time in February 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.781" offset="7269426">The running of his five-year from and after sentence is from that date, and Mr. Real ceases to be in Massachusetts custody in February of 1987, rather than in July of 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.069" offset="7318536">Mr. Real clearly has a concrete interest in this case which presents the Court with a justiciable controversy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1826.247" offset="7439326">First of all, this is a classic case where the calling of witnesses would be, as Justice Blackmun suggested, very important to the inmate's defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.516" offset="7496378">What had happened in the prison on the particular day in question was that a scuffle had broken out between an inmate and a guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.174" offset="7539009">A number of other inmates who were in the vicinity came into the room to see what was happening, after which they were ordered to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.862" offset="7577775">It was at this point that Mr. Real, while leaving, was stopped, according to his testimony at the hearing, was stopped by another officer who shook him down and delayed him from complying with the order that had been given to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.794" offset="7657501">The inmates which John Real requested be called in his defense were eye witnesses who would have corroborated his version of what happened, and therefore, in our view, would have given him a defense to the charge that he had disobeyed an officer and also the charges, in addition, that he had incited to riot and that he had engaged in conduct which was disruptive of the orderly running of the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.424" offset="7788009">All three of these charges were made against Mr. Real, and all three of them were at issue in the disciplinary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.319" offset="7819564">And the witnesses that Mr. Real requested be called and which the record below indicates were requested because they had been present and because they would corroborate his version of what happened, were the witnesses who were denied without any explanation at any point in either the administrative or the judicial proceedings of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2559.737" offset="10373191">And also earlier in the opinion, the portion of the opinion referred to by Justice Stevens on page 16, where the court in defining the issue presented, indicates that the question is whether federal due process requirements impose a duty on the Board to explain in any fashion at the hearing or later, why witnesses were not allowed to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.008" offset="10486353">So we think both issues were properly presented, and at least implicitly properly considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.631" offset="10516864">However, we think that the Respondent may defend the judgment below on any ground that's properly presented by the law and the record, regardless of whether either of the courts below considered both of those issues specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.913" offset="10581961">So that even if the Supreme Judicial Court's reasoning was based on the broader issue, if that rationale is not necessary for a decision of the case by this Court, which we don't think it is, it would be unnecessary for this Court to decide that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.876" offset="10661791">We think that the principle of judicial restraint counsels in favor of deciding the narrower, rather than the broader issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.243" offset="10695228">And since the narrower issue, that is, the arbitrariness of the denial of the witnesses on the facts of this case, was properly presented, provided the basis for the decision by the trial court, that that can properly be the basis for a decision by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.734" offset="10773178">On that issue, furthermore, we think that the Commonwealth, in effect, concedes that judicial review is appropriate where the inmate has made a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.384" offset="10831796">Judicial review, in a subsequent habeas corpus proceeding, at which point when the inmate has made that prima facie case, the prison officials would have some burden to justify the denial of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.587" offset="10896684">In this case, we think that a prima facie case was made, and it is difficult to see what more an inmate could be required to do than to make a timely request for relevant witnesses who could testify and in this case provide a basis for a self defense claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.391" offset="10987904">The Petitioner's argument that there is a greater burden defies common sense, and it also would make that burden impossible to be met by the inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.169" offset="11042970">It's difficult to see how the inmate could disprove the reasons that the prison officials may have for not calling a witness if the inmate can't even find out what those reasons are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.751" offset="11109321">The Petitioner argues that somehow the inmate has a greater burden to go beyond making a showing of relevance to his or her case, and to in fact disprove any possible reasons the Commonwealth might have for not calling the witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2761.791" offset="11181419">Mr. Shapiro, what about Justice O'Connor's suggestion made to your opponent, that perhaps there should be reasons at least adduced in the habeas corpus hearing, but that perhaps those reasons should be submitted in camera to the judge just because of the very volatility of the prison situation?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="2783.786" offset="11269400">We think that where the Commonwealth makes a showing that that is a consideration in the case, that would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.943" offset="11310046">Indeed, it would be appropriate, turning for a moment to the question of requiring some statement of reason or other basis to appear in the administrative record for a similar requirement, and we have referred in our brief to the regulations of the Federal Bureau of Prisons which provides just for such a possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.660" offset="11404923">And in a case where the Disciplinary Board concludes that documenting the reliability of an informant upon which it has relied in a decision would pose a threat to identifying that informant or otherwise endangering that informant, the Disciplinary Board of the chairperson of the Disciplinary Board may document those reasons, but not provide them to the inmate: that is, to keep them apart from the inmate for the very purpose of a subsequent justification in court, at which time the reasons could be examined or the statement could be examined in camera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.748" offset="11589243">So that the only serious claim that the Commonwealth has made here that a statement of reasons would interfere with security or endanger the identify of an informant, there is a perfectly reasonable alternative which could be utilized so that those reasons would not prejudice the particular informant involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.697" offset="11697076">The other argument that Petitioner makes to justify the prison officials in not having to make any showing, either at the administrative hearing or otherwise, is that an inmate's right to present witnesses is not violated unless there is a pattern or practice or a discrimination by the Disciplinary Board or the prison officials which go beyond the individual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.109" offset="11830719">We think in Wolff v. McDonnell, this Court clearly stated that a witness has... an inmate has a right to call witnesses unless the witnesses would be irrelevant, cumulative, unnecessary, or pose a threat to institutional security in some other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.814" offset="11921520">The argument that somehow the inmate could be denied witnesses arbitrarily, so long as there was no overt discrimination or pattern in practice, is simply inconsistent with Wolff, and is unrelated to the reasons for according an inmate that right to call witnesses, which is to give that individual an opportunity to have a fair hearing on the charges against that particular inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.418" offset="12051924">And why, in order to establish that that right has been violated, that inmate would have to show that there is some pattern in practice, escapes me, and I think finds no support whatsoever in any of the cases this Court has decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.294" offset="12111483">The Commonwealth's argument would also carry the principle of deference to the expert judgment of prison officials too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.853" offset="12161742">What the Commonwealth, in effect, is arguing is that the officials should be presumed to have made a decision to deny witnesses in accordance with applicable regulations, and that any inquiry into the basis for that refusal is unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.638" offset="12244812">It's one thing to defer where prison officials have exercised a judgment; it's another thing to defer to the presumption that they have exercised a judgment in accordance with applicable regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.425" offset="12299982">And the effect of the decisions of the court below is primarily to require that that discretion by prison officials, to which this Court has often deferred, is in fact actually exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.878" offset="12365811">Without some obligation, either in the administrative hearing or in court, to justify their action, there is in fact no right to call witnesses on behalf of the inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.366" offset="12431744">And there is no properly exercised discretion to which a court could defer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.972" offset="12466226">So in many ways, the requirements of the courts below would serve the interests of both the Commonwealth and the inmate by insuring that the officials to whom discretion is accorded have, in fact, exercised it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.415" offset="12539996">Once there is that exercise, a court could properly, as this Court has often counseled, defer to the discretion because of the expertise which may have been possessed by the officials who exercised it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.424" offset="12596002">We do think that Hughes v. Roe is or should be dispositive of the case, because in Hughes the inmate was held to have made a prima facie showing that he was entitled to a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.885" offset="12665801">And the prison officials, as in the present case, made no response, made no showing as to any legitimate basis in administration for correctional goals for denying that hearing, and this Court said in the absence of such a showing, the inmate was entitled to relief; or at least in that case, because it involved a complaint, that the complaint should not be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.286" offset="12783457">The same principle we think is applicable here where, as we argue, the prima facie case is made where the prison officials in court make no showing of a legitimate basis for not according that right of the inmate to call witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.136" offset="12854823">Then, that inmate should be entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.051" offset="12874467">With respect to the decision of the court below on the issue of whether or not due process requires that the administrative record of a disciplinary hearing have some support for the decision to deny witnesses, I'd like to emphasize first that that decision is not inconsistent with Wolff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.487" offset="12976240">In Wolff, this Court stated that an inmate has a right to call witnesses, which may be denied if there are certain legitimate considerations involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.707" offset="13029112">The Court went on to say that although it would be useful for the Board to give an explanation of its reasons and make a written statement of those reasons in the record, at that time the Court deemed it unnecessary to require that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.588" offset="13100688">The Supreme Judicial Court's decision, first of all, does not require a written statement of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.023" offset="13126392">What it does require is that there be some support in the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.088" offset="13146663">That requirement is a far more flexible requirement than a written statement of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.593" offset="13172681">That requirement can be satisfied by reviewing the record to determine whether the record itself supports a decision to deny witnesses; for example, if the request of the inmate himself or herself indicates that the witnesses would not be relevant to the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.999" offset="13278320">For example, the charge may be such that it's clear that no witnesses could appropriately testify in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.455" offset="13320116">The Board, at a later review in court, could rely upon that information which is obvious from a review of the record itself to deny.</text>

            <text syncTime="3306.931" offset="13362017">That would be pretty coincidental, though, wouldn't it, when the record happened to support because of the testimony of other witnesses or something else, the refusal of the... or due to the record, supplied the reasons for the prison officials' refusal to call the witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="3342.877" offset="13505795">So that although there may be cases where a statement of reasons or some explanation by the Board is required, we think that there are many other cases where the record itself will, upon review, provide an adequate basis for a decision by the Board.</text>
