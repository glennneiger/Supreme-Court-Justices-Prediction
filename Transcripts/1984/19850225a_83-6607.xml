            <text syncTime="12.890" offset="178888">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, this case is here on certiorari to the Mississippi Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.923" offset="210967">There are three issues that I would like to address in this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.386" offset="224864">The first is whether or not the remarks by the prosecutor that the verdict, jury verdict is non-final and subject to appellate review constitutes constitutional error.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.135" offset="275855">The second issue is whether or not there was a denial of Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights in denying experts and a criminal investigator.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.002" offset="315352">And thirdly, whether certain remarks by the prosecutor at the sentencing phase of the trial, wherein he alluded and compared this case with all the other capital cases that he had tried, whether or not that constitutes plain error which this Court should notice under the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.473" offset="385256">The facts with regard to the first issue are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.594" offset="401661">Under Mississippi practice, the prosecutor has the right to open and close during summation.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.220" offset="436247">During the rebuttal portion of his summation to the jury, he argued, your decision is not the final decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.617" offset="477834">Your decision is reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.579" offset="489641">Defense counsel immediately objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.882" offset="502807">The court ruled on that objection and overruled it, stating that under the Mississippi death statute there was in fact mandatory review of decisions by the jury in a capital case, and instructed the prosecutor to make full expression of his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.096" offset="591728">The prosecutor proceeded to state to the jury that defense counsel had wrongfully insinuated that their decision was not final, and again repeated that it was subject to review.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.139" offset="779914">The Mississippi Supreme Court split four to four, with one judge disqualifying himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.710" offset="806141">The court ruled... based its decision primarily on three grounds, first, that under this Court's decision in California against Ramos, that the states were free to determine what the jury would hear in this area, and felt that this was appropriate argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.685" offset="882105">Secondly, they maintained that this was invited error by suggesting that imprisonment was for the rest of the petitioner's natural life, and thirdly, the court held that the issue was foreclosed by virtue of the failure of counsel to comply with Rule 6B.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.507" offset="961308">Petitioner maintains that the remarks violated the due process clause and the Eighth Amendment first on the ground that those remarks were false and misleading to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.615" offset="1009791">The statute involved here, and it is set forth in the petitioner's brief at 6A of our appendix to that brief, on its face and as construed by that court, is a final determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.685" offset="1078023">It is the sole and exclusive function of the jury in the state of Mississippi to ascertain and determine the appropriate sentence in a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.903" offset="1126924">The argument here that they were not the final determiners of that sentence is simply false.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.839" offset="1162660">Moreover, it was false also in suggesting to the jury that someone else shared the responsibility which under that state statute is solely and exclusively theirs.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.680" offset="1290033">However, I respectfully submit to the Court that it would be a much different case for this Court to consider were it not for the fact that counsel here argued in addition to the review element the fact that it was a non-final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.943" offset="1363071">Secondly, we maintain that the argument by the prosecutor unconstitutionally diminished the jury's responsibility for imposition of the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.420" offset="1416988">The remarks here were intended to overcome the jurors' natural reluctance to return a death sentence by diluting their responsibility for the consequence of those actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.489" offset="1469233">The dissent below pointed out that a juror in deliberation is going to be... feeling that death is an inappropriate sentence, is simply going to be much less likely to hold out in the event that he or she knew that any error could be corrected in connection with an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.645" offset="1557945">This Court in the Witherspoon case admittedly in a totally different context indicated that it is a fundamental guarantee of due process that the decision as to whether a person lives or dies must be made on scales that are not deliberately tipped toward death.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.108" offset="1643731">We respectfully submit to this Court that the prosecutor's argument here encouraged the jurors to err on the side of death with the false assurance that if death is not appropriate, the Supreme Court will correct that error.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.629" offset="1705798">The verdict based on such remarks is one in which the jurors' moral responsibility is diminished to unconstitutional proportions.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.785" offset="1746444">I would like to briefly discuss the California against Ramos case, which we submit is simply not controlling in this case, and we make that argument for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.542" offset="1797540">First, in California against Ramos, this Court made it very, very clear that they were paying due deference to the state statute, the enactment by the legislature of the state of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.592" offset="1849680">Here, on the other hand, we are dealing with the remarks of a prosecutor, and although there is legislation in this area to the effect that there is mandatory review, that legislation, unlike the Briggs instructions, does not embody also the instruction that the jury be told about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.085" offset="1931705">And so we respectfully submit that that is a very, very significant distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.487" offset="1949259">But isn't that a state law distinction in essence?</text>
            <text syncTime="459.450" offset="1965142">I mean, would you say the distinction vanishes if the Mississippi legislature had said that juries ought to be told about this, and if your answer to that is yes, why isn't the Mississippi Supreme Court a perfectly good spokesman for state policy, just as the legislature would be?</text>

            <text syncTime="477.343" offset="2036717">If we are talking just about that element, that would be a matter for the state to determine and so advise the judges of the trial courts that this is a matter for particular instruction for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.462" offset="2101187">We have the element in this case, Justice Rehnquist, of a misleading statement in addition to the comment and interrelated to the comment on judicial review.</text>

            <text syncTime="511.944" offset="2175062">There is another reason with regard to the state policy why it would not be admissible, and that is, this Court made it clear that under California law in the Ramos case evidence was permitted on the factor which this Court equated with future dangerousness as being a question of fact, and evidence was admissible with regard to that element, and counsel could comment on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.354" offset="2288746">You don't have that situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.956" offset="2299195">Here you have the unmitigated, I submit to the Court, danger of speculation solely on what these nine Justices of the Mississippi Supreme Court will do, and I submit that the arbitrary and capricious nature of that speculation is no more visible in this case where you have this four to four split which affirmed and one judge disqualifying, and then, as we pointed out in our brief, at a later time the judge who disqualified himself actually joined the dissenting opinion here to make it the majority.</text>

            <text syncTime="590.815" offset="2490621">It is just that there are factors here that were not present in the Ramos case that make Ramos not controlling in this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.073" offset="2531581">If Your Honor is positing the question whether or not in the event that the Mississippi Supreme Court in their infinite wisdom decided to permit comment on non-review, I would first of all take the position that it shouldn't be done by the prosecutor, and if it is going to be done, as it was done in the Ramos case, it is an instruction by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.619" offset="2621755">But that really is a hypothetical which has been decided by the Mississippi Supreme Court which has said, we don't want this statute to go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.075" offset="2663656">So that is the state of the law today in Mississippi by virtue of cases which came after the Caldwell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.880" offset="2694794">Lastly, we would argue that under the Woodson against North Carolina standard, the speculation here and the remark by defense counsel simply diverted the jury from considering the nature of the offense and the individual characteristics of the offender, which really are the true focus and the constitutional obligation of a jury to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.589" offset="2805657">We maintain that there was no invited error.</text>

            <text syncTime="677.883" offset="2838885">And I respectfully submit to the Court that it made it clear that the invited reply theory as far as prosecutorial argument is a response in kind, and here there is simply no response in kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="740.914" offset="3091019">What the court seized on, the majority seized on in this case was that they had argued imprisonment for the rest of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.201" offset="3136159">Comments by the prosecutor actually... he used the exact same term, and it is the only statutory alternative that an attorney has to argue to a jury, and I submit that that simply is not invited error, and there is simply no response whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.066" offset="3219542">Lastly, with regard to this issue, this Court decided Ebbits against Lucy last month, and we call that to the Court's attention with regard to the respondent's argument that there is an adequate independent state ground here for the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.415" offset="3284952">I believe that under Lucy the failure by the assigned appellate counsel in this case to claim this as error would prevent the court, the Mississippi Supreme Court, from reaching the merits with regard to that issue, and accordingly we submit that it is not an adequate state ground, and that this Court should consider the merits of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.413" offset="3384949">I would lastly point out on this issue that the Mississippi Supreme Court in effect waived Rule 6B because they invited counsel prior to the argument to address that issue in oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.601" offset="3441687">They accepted briefs on it, and in fact they did deliberate and reach a decision on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.285" offset="3460495">And so I think under Lucy and under just the general law the adequacy of an independent state ground, being itself a federal question, that should not be a bar here.</text>

            <text syncTime="903.373" offset="3740841">If I may go into the facts with regard to the second issue under the Sixth Amendment, there was a pretrial motion for a psychiatrist, a ballistics expert, a fingerprint expert, and a criminal investigator.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.132" offset="3795803">The request for a fingerprint expert in the Mississippi Supreme Court below was treated as a request for an expert with regard to the foot cast evidence, and I would urge this Court to do so, and the respondent urged the Mississippi Supreme Court to do so, I believe, in their brief, and that has been the way the case has proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.096" offset="3879708">The order notes that the claim for all these experts, including psychiatrists, was made in order to establish an adequate defense, and they appointed, the Court appointed its own expert in the area of psychiatry and then denied the application with regard to the other experts, and they did so, and I quote, "based on recent Mississippi cases", and that is a question as to what they were referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.916" offset="3999035">At the trial, these experts, there was a ballistics expert called by the prosecution, and he testified in assisting the government to make out their prima facie case.</text>

            <text syncTime="994.253" offset="4104361">There was cross examination which only really further bolstered the claim with regard to the strength of the ballistics testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.909" offset="4146993">On summation, the prosecutor highlighted the ballistics testimony and then he even went so far as to note to the jury that it stood unimpeached.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_s_boyd_iii" startTime="1829.320" stopTime="2037.816">
            <label>Mr. William S. Boyd, III</label>
            <text syncTime="1829.320" offset="7444586">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, initially I would like to briefly summarize the state's position on the three issues that have been raised in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.512" offset="7521386">The initial question, of course, concerns the propriety of advising the jury of a condemned prisoner's right of mandatory appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.197" offset="7556077">State court resolution of this issue rested upon two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.562" offset="7573527">The first was procedural, the second substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.803" offset="7582513">While we feel that the ultimate resolution of the issue was based on independent and adequate state grounds, that is, state procedural grounds, we shall concentrate our comments this morning upon the substantive aspect of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.143" offset="7643848">Within this regard, while the Mississippi Supreme Court divided four to four over the state's argument, it unanimously concluded that this Court's decision in California versus Ramos was the benchmark from which they must work, and that the ultimate resolution of the issue was a question of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.294" offset="7720544">The second, the denial of expert and investigative services, it is the state's position that a defendant does not have a constitutional right to expert or investigative assistance simply upon demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.195" offset="7776133">He must demonstrate to the trial judge that the services requested are both necessary and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.838" offset="7802673">And as for the third question, the confrontation issue, we note that there was no objection to a portion of counsel's argument identified in the briefs, and that the issue was not raised on direct appeal in the Mississippi Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.326" offset="7860665">The issue is clearly barred under state law, and we suggest that this Court's recent case in United States versus Young is more or less dispositive of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.816" offset="7906536">Within this regard, we suggest that certiorari has been improvidently granted on that particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.259" offset="7932345">Now, directing our comments to the closing argument question, we note that in particular there was nothing really per se objectionable to defense counsel's comments during closing summation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.159" offset="7995979">However, both the trial judge and the assistant district attorney were both of the opinion that the argument left the jury with the impression that once a sentence of death was returned, nothing could be done to correct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.049" offset="8055538">I believe the way that the assistant district attorney termed it, that they were going to take the defendant out the front door and string him up at that point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.354" offset="8088766">The Mississippi Supreme Court or his Court has basically... has consistently held that based upon principles of comity and federalism, in particular the case of Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, review is limited to determine whether the arguments of counsel in state court cases render the trial so fundamentally unfair as to deny the defendant due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.302" offset="8188554">Within this regard, we note three major points that this Court has in the past identified in questions concerning state court closing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.696" offset="8226066">This was also recently stressed in the recent case of United States versus Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.603" offset="8249785">And that is, arguments must be viewed or reviewed within the totality of the circumstances of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2037.816" offset="8278624">Mr. Boyd, may I ask you one question that just occurred to me?</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.888" offset="8290849">The administration of the death... capital punishment is often criticized because of the great delay that elapses between the imposition of the sentence and the carrying out of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.961" offset="8323137">Do you think it would have been prejudicial to the prosecutor if the jury had the impression that the sentence would be carried out in a very short period of time?</text>

            <text syncTime="2063.371" offset="8380815">Apparently the response was needed, as I understand kind of the preliminary comment you made, because it might have been harmful to the prosecutor's case if the jury thought they were going to take him right out immediately and implement the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.022" offset="8435463">Is that your view, that the jury would have a distorted view of the case and it would harm the prosecutor to think that that sentence would be carried out promptly?</text>

            <text syncTime="2086.599" offset="8473706">Your Honor, I am not so sure that it would have harmed the state's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.439" offset="8489066">I think what, in my impression of reading the closing argument in this case, was that the state was simply trying to inform the jury or advise the jury that death would not be administered in an arbitrary and capricious fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.568" offset="8545595">There was a good bit of discussion by state's counsel in this matter concerning the state of the law prior to this Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia, that in essence what we had was an automatic imposition of death with basically a mercy clause, that then the state's counsel went in and discussed this Court's decision in Furman, noting that the Court had found those statutes that existed at that time were arbitrary, that death was administered in a capricious fashion and what not, then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.120" offset="8679760">The Court came down... the state's attorney noted that the legislature had undertaken to enact new statutes dealing with this question in order to funnel or to guide the jury's discretion to take the arbitrary aspects or the capricious aspects out of imposition of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.644" offset="8761889">He then went into this Court's discussion or this Court's decision in Gregg v. Georgia and Proffitt v. Florida, and one thing that I think is a key point to his argument was that he stressed, and there are a number of instances in his closing argument where he stressed that it was the jury's determination that this Court had made its decision in Gregg and Proffitt to the effect that it was the jury who was to decide what the particular or what the appropriate punishment would be under the circumstances of the case within a channel of guided discretion, as the Court has discussed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2193.217" offset="8900234">But all of that just suggests to me that there was really no need to respond to what the defense counsel said, that basically it was a jury decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2221.887" offset="9014859">The argument that was given by defense counsel in essence said, if you return this verdict, you are going to kill the man.</text>

            <text syncTime="2255.128" offset="9147875">Yes, of course, that is true, that if a life sentence was returned, then of course no one could execute him, but what... our position in this matter is this, that there are a line of cases, particularly emanating from the state of Lousiana, cases such as State v. Berry, State v. Matheson, State v. Monroe, and this Court's decision is Maggio versus Williams, wherein it was discussed a dichotomy more or less or a dual system that they have developed in Lousiana, and that is where the closing argument is addressed to dispelling in the jury's minds the question of arbitrary imposition of death, then such an argument is appropriate under the circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2368.282" offset="9600420">In both of those cases as well as all eight Justices in this particular case have noted that this is a question of state law, that in Wiley and in Williams they have exercised their supervisory powers, and now prohibited arguments of this nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="2400.912" offset="9730928">My position is that under Donnelly v.

            <text syncTime="2420.594" offset="9809713">I would assume that a misleading argument would in that nature be false or spurious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.229" offset="9828208">However, we do preface it with this, that this argument was not, was not misleading.</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.895" offset="9922875">However, he did add to that that it would be reviewed by the Mississippi Supreme Court, and of course under state law the Mississippi Supreme Court does have the right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2471.208" offset="10012110">There are three of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.611" offset="10017752">The court must in performing what we refer to in state law as proportionality review or mandatory appellate review, one, whether the sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors, two, that the evidence supports the aggravating circumstances, and three, that the sentence is not excessive or disproportionate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.394" offset="10108867">Within this regard, the Court is authorized to remand to the trial court for modification of sentence to life imprisonment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2524.193" offset="10224119">I read that to indicate that his view was that the prosecutor's argument did not make a full and accurate statement of the function of the reviewing court.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_s_boyd_iii" startTime="2536.330" stopTime="3004.441">
            <label>Mr. William S. Boyd, III</label>
            <text syncTime="2536.330" offset="10272603">--That is a difficult thing to explain, in that that particular court in the case of Edwards v. State did exactly that, that we had a jury determination that Hezekiah Edwards should be sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.111" offset="10339790">In that particular case, the evidence was clearly that the man was not suffering from psychosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.607" offset="10361733">However, the Mississippi Supreme Court, in reviewing that matter, determined that they did not agree with the jury verdict, vacated the sentence of death, and sentenced Mr. Edwards to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.445" offset="10409066">Now, there are comments in this particular matter that I don't particularly understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.011" offset="10431323">Some of the comments made by the dissent I don't particularly understand, but mine is not to know exactly what they are talking about in the matter, just to argue the cases before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.628" offset="10473850">Within this regard, the question as to diminished responsibility we suggest that this Court's recent decision in Wainwright versus Witt and the decision in Donnelly v. DeChristoforo mandates that deference be given to the trial judge's determination as to what was said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.973" offset="10571235">The trial judge in this particular case felt that defense counsel's closing arguments were misleading to the jury, and instructed the assistant district attorney basically to straighten the matter out, and this is what he attempted to do, to address the question as to whether or not the defendant would be taken out the front of the courthouse and there summarily executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.477" offset="10669246">A corollary to this is a case which is currently pending before this Court on certiorari, the case of Booker v. State, wherein defense counsel is the one that got up at the initiation of the proceedings and started talking about let's go ahead and sentence this man to life, because we have all of these multiple appeals that we are going to go through in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.905" offset="10766944">Likewise, in this particular case, defense counsel discussed at great length this Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia, and noted that the Assistant District Attorney would probably address comments in that direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.283" offset="10816472">So I think that we do have something here that both the Mississippi Supreme Court in its supervisory capacity and the lower trial court found not to be particularly objectionable under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.743" offset="10878330">Addressing the second point in this matter, the expert witness question, there are several things that we need to, I suppose, straighten out in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.150" offset="10915946">There have been three recent decisions by the Mississippi Supreme Court on this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.473" offset="10937262">Ruffin v. State, which is cited at length in our brief, DuFor v. State, and Billiot v. State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.617" offset="10961817">Billiot v. State gives a rather protracted recounting of the history of this particular point in the jurisprudence of the state of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.755" offset="11010301">Likewise, DuFor v. State recognizes the particular special aspects that psychological or mental health professionals play within the context of the criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.152" offset="11059933">Historically speaking, Mississippi has recognized the right of an indigent offender to expert and investigative services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.657" offset="11093997">And it consistently held that the determination of whether to provide such services must be made on a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.175" offset="11128061">Here, we would note in particular one thing that I don't know has been made abundantly clear, and that is that Mr. Caldwell did have the assistance of a psychiatrist in this matter appointed at state expense to the tune of $70 per hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.464" offset="11201204">That was Dr. Allen Battle of Memphis, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.107" offset="11215728">Not only did he have that, but prior to trial he was sent to the Mississippi State Hospital at Whitfield, where he was examined there by the staff at the state hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.143" offset="11251881">Apparently counsel chose not to use these professionals that were given to him for these particular purposes within this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.061" offset="11291587">Substantively speaking, and this is something that the petitioner has attacked rather particularly here, and that is Section 9915.17, the authorization for retention of these services, Billiot v. State speaks to the particular question as to whether or not this statute is applicable, and found that it has been so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.335" offset="11376642">However, the court by judicial definition has impressed upon the statutory authority the requirements that the defendant on a motion to the court, one, outline the specific cause that will be involved... in this case it was $70 an hour by Dr. Battle... two, the purpose of the services, why do you need these services, and three, the value of the proposed testimony of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.651" offset="11477893">Now, in this particular case we must remember several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.163" offset="11495969">One was that defense counsel never told the court who he wanted retained as a footprint expert or who he wanted retained as a ballistics expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.222" offset="11548214">So there the court was confronted with a situation where there was no indication as to what witness expert the defendant wanted in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.128" offset="11591786">I think that within the overall constitutional context, and while I often times do not agree with this organization, I find myself agreeing with it in this particular case, and that is the American Civil Liberties Union, in their brief to this Court in the case of Eit v. Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.161" offset="11660018">And Footnote 22 of their brief in that particular matter I think adequately summarized what the law was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.915" offset="11690947">Our submission is not that state paid experts should be made available to indigent defendants on demand, or that the Constitution requires the state to provide indigents with the same quantum of assistance that a millionaire might choose to mobilize for his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.266" offset="11752387">We suggest that the Criminal Justice Act's constitutionally grounded standard of assistance necessary to an adequate defense and the workable criteria developed by the federal courts and by many state courts operating under similar statutes to implement that standard may be appropriately applied to implement the constitutional guarantee of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.111" offset="11843816">In the recent cases of Ruffin and Billiot, the Mississippi Supreme Court has recognized that a due process standard does exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.487" offset="11881223">However, it has still maintained that the principles that were announced in Bullock v. State and the earlier cases were still applicable in that you had to outline the costs, state the purpose of the services, and the value of the proposed testimony to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.938" offset="11951127">Now, in this particular case, as to the ballistics expert and the fingerprint expert or footprint expert, the necessity of these services has not been shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.836" offset="12006715">The man confessed, the petitioner in this case confessed to shooting the victim twice in the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.902" offset="12034928">He confessed that he walked to the store across the pasture, and he confessed that he walked away from the store across the pasture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.968" offset="12071186">Consequently, to be frank with the Court, the expert services that were used by the state in this matter were frankly immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.244" offset="12104309">Where you have a confession that the man did it, and the confession is not questioned before this Court, I see no necessity for these particular services.</text>

            <text syncTime="3004.441" offset="12145060">But can't the defendant say that if a state has sufficient doubt about the other evidence that it is going to call a ballistics expert that the defendant is entitled to call one, too?</text>

            <text syncTime="3019.688" offset="12206082">I don't think that that is a proper standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.102" offset="12215695">The Eleventh Circuit in particular has developed a particular line of cases which say that where the state has expert witnesses available for the defense to talk to, to examine prior to trial, and things of this nature, and where there is no showing that those particular experts are biased toward the defendant or are particularly not... will not consult with them and things like that, that that may be of some significance, and may necessitate the appointment of additional experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.305" offset="12356547">But unless we are dealing with a crucial point of evidence, that is, where it is the pivotal point of evidence within the case, I do not think that the Constitution mandates that such an expert be appointed for defense counsel purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.375" offset="12420808">Likewise on the investigative assistance question, we note that under the Criminal Justice Act, there is a $150 maximum ceiling placed on investigative services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.074" offset="12475666">Within this regard, the advisory committee on the Criminal Justice Act has recommended to this Court that such services be sparingly used, and that they be viewed with great... graded severely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.107" offset="12559780">In this particular case, there were 35 witnesses, and the motion noted that the state had 35 witnesses that they would call.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.684" offset="12594053">However, we would note from the record that both counsel were appointed for the petitioner in this case on March the 23rd, 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.457" offset="12625191">The names and addresses of these particular witnesses were provided to counsel eight days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.662" offset="12649955">The matter was called for trial some seven months later, in October.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.994" offset="12667300">Consequently, there was a tremendous amount of time between the actual appointment and the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.311" offset="12700528">Likewise, we would note that prior to trial, the trial judge directed the state to provide defense counsel with copies of the initial investigative interviews in these cases, and counsel had that in order to cross examine the particular witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.364" offset="12788822">We would more or less rely on our brief on the third question in this matter, and if the Court has no further questions, I will--</text>
