            <text syncTime="70.060" offset="414568">This matter comes for review from the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, and involves a state prisoner's habeas corpus claim of constitutional deprivation on state appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.833" offset="457722">The question presented for resolution today is whether there is any constitutional impediment to dismissal of a state appeal for failure of retained appellate counsel to follow the rules of procedure, and a specific portion of that question is whether under the Constitution there is any entitlement to effective assistance of appellate counsel on state appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.900" offset="562003">The holding of the Sixth Circuit was that indeed there is a right to effective assistance of appellate counsel on state appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.772" offset="601500">Before we list the facts, we would submit to the Court that we in arguing this matter will address the Sixth Amendment as to the possible right of effective assistance on state appeal, and as to the due process implications, we will look at two lines of cases of this Court, the McKane line and the Griffin-Douglas line, and we would suggest harmonizing of those lines, apparent differences in cases like Ross v.

            <text syncTime="173.092" offset="826780">Our position is that the question may be considered by the Court, that it is not moot even though Mr. Lucey, the Respondent, has been finally discharged from parole, and indeed, his civil rights have been restored.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.054" offset="886549">The reason for that is... there are several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.272" offset="903476">When this action started in the District Court, when his petition for habeas corpus was filed, he in fact at that time was in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.712" offset="937226">There exists the possibility of some collateral consequences as long as this conviction remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.116" offset="966797">If he were to go to trial, there's the possibility of impeachment from that conviction, could be considered at sentencing, and in terms of Kentucky procedure, if the trial were there, under our persistent felony offender statute, any sentence he might receive could be enhanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.762" offset="1045478">In addition, the Commonwealth is under orders which are stayed in this matter to either grant Mr. Lucey a new trial or to somehow reinstate his appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.320" offset="1095633">And as we read the cases submitted, Strickland especially, and the ones following, it appears that there almost exists perhaps a presumption that under these circumstances collateral legal consequences will occur, not that they definitely will, but a presumption perhaps.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.492" offset="1868335">Mr. Lucey was tried before a jury in a Kentucky Circuit Court, and he was found guilty of trafficking in LSD and cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.448" offset="1904175">He timely appealed to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.983" offset="1918281">He filed a brief on appeal in that court in which he raised three claims of error in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.989" offset="1946284">His retained appellate attorney, however, did not comply with the rule regarding statement of appeal, and because of that, the appeal ultimately was dismissed without making a decision on the claim Mr. Lucey raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.331" offset="2007724">His attempts to combat that in the Kentucky courts were unavailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.217" offset="2027264">He then went into the District Court with his habeas corpus claim that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.739" offset="2057357">The Petitioners appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court, and the ultimate result of that is the holding of that Court, which is that there is a due process right to effective assistance of appellate counsel on state appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.749" offset="2121409">We disagree with that, as we have set out, and our argument will be based in two ways, examining what we see as the reality of the Sixth Amendment, and examining the two lines of cases that I mentioned earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.977" offset="2194238">But before doing that, if I may, I think it would be helpful to briefly examine Mr. Lucey's brief for what we consider some important agreements by him with some of our basic positions.</text>

            <text syncTime="563.974" offset="2390261">The practice in Kentucky is that almost all, according to my experience and observation, almost all orders of dismissal are brief, and they are not to be published, so there are in reality not many opinions in Kentucky discussing any particular aspect relating to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.688" offset="2469151">There are some, but most of them are by unpublished order.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.740" offset="2485347">And the facts in the case you referred to, Your Honor, seemed to be most unlike the facts here in that in England, almost all, substantially all of the information was required in the document... or I'm sorry, almost all the information was placed in the document.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.088" offset="2570715">There was one departure which the Court deemed insignificant to following the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.492" offset="2596315">Here, no document at all was tendered, and none of this information was assembled in one document before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.080" offset="2626722">Mr. Lucey has several times stated that nevertheless, the information could be found within his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.836" offset="2657755">There are two difficulties with that, I would submit, and they are that no court has ever agreed with that contention, and I would submit that while some information is in the brief, other required information is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.845" offset="2713762">And in any event, we would further submit that one of the main purposes of the rule which was not followed is to put in one document the required information for the purpose of effecting judicial economy so they could quickly find out a number of things the Court thinks to be important.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.573" offset="2792651">The first is you have to put or you should put in the document when the judgment was entered and where in the record it can be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.679" offset="2825043">In tandem with that is the notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.531" offset="2836537">This very quickly let's the appellate court know if the appeal jurisdictionally is properly before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.368" offset="2863809">Then it tells the Court if there are good reasons to advance, if there should be consolidation, and a number of other things.</text>

            <text syncTime="694.176" offset="2911038">As long as you're interrupted, Mr. Henry, and in somewhat the same vein, the Kentucky Supreme Court has suggested in the Stahl case that the proper remedy when an appeal is denied or dismissed because of counsel's error is for the trial court to have some new proceeding and allow a new appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.213" offset="3035277">So it sounds as though the practice in Kentucky under these circumstances might reach the same end result as the Sixth Circuit did, in other words, normally allowing a new appeal when counsel has erred, as here.</text>

            <text syncTime="755.583" offset="3156694">I would submit as my first evidence of that the face of the Stahl opinion itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.137" offset="3178950">I believe examination of it will suggest three approaches to this, one in the collateral attack court or the trial court, the possibility of a belated appeal in appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.294" offset="3227538">But after all that is said and done, the end of the case is the Kentucky Supreme Court wants the rules followed, and that unless the rules are followed, this cannot be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.954" offset="3282186">The genesis of this line of cases, if I may say so, I believe, is the Hammershoy case in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.394" offset="3323982">That I submit is an equal protection case, and that marked a change in the Kentucky method of dealing with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.499" offset="3356374">It is an equal protection case, and examination will show that the Supreme Court of Kentucky was trying to give fidelity to equal protection decisions of this Court and cited them and said, number one, we had always thought the procedure for handling this was different.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.727" offset="3429308">Nevertheless, the Supreme Court suggests otherwise, and we will accommodate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.698" offset="3449161">Then it said we are not really sure that we understand what the Supreme Court has said, but as best we can, we elect to give fidelity to that and do the best we can.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.773" offset="3501510">So I would submit that the Stahl question is a valid one, but if you will read the three parts, on the face of it I believe you will get a good indication of the disarray which exists, and I would submit that it is because of this case which in the Sixth Circuit had its genesis in Cleaver and Gilbert.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.811" offset="6021595">But yes, indeed, it does help me in the sense that I don't have to deny that it exists and attack the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.550" offset="6056599">The benefit we see to the Ross v. Moffitt case is we think it explains and harmonizes the differences, no due process in McKane, some due process, Griffin-Douglas, and it does it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.476" offset="6116263">We believe that it finds that due process in the Griffin-Douglas line of cases exists in tandem only with equal protection, if equal protection exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.034" offset="6166522">But steps, the way it does that, it starts and says that neither due process clause nor equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by itself satisfactorily explains the result of the Griffin-Douglas cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.813" offset="6229634">It goes on to define fairness in terms, traditional terms, and defines equal protection as to disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.168" offset="6263071">And we would submit to the Court that the key to this in harmonizing it, and later on we submit not to extending it, is this quotation from Ross.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.976" offset="6310300">Unfairness results only if indigents are singled out by the state and denied meaningful access to the appellate system because of their poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.998" offset="6346349">This question is more profitably considered under an equal protection analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.384" offset="6363904">That just reiterates that due process as it is mentioned in the Griffin-Douglas lines of cases exists only in tandem with an actual existence of an equal protection violation or disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.876" offset="6425866">So whereas here or in any case, if there is no equal protection in existence, then there is no existence of due process either because neither by itself supports the result reached; they must act in tandem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.838" offset="6489709">Thus, absent equal protection there is an absence of due process, and Ross v. Moffitt is nicely explained, and more importantly, harmonized, two important lines of cases, and I think along the way it suggested an unwillingness to extend Griffin and Douglas farther, and I think definitely we should not add a whole new layer of appellate effective counsel claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.005" offset="6598379">If there is fundamental constitutional deprivation at state trial, raise that as always in the habeas corpus court directly and don't do it directly and eat up a lot of time and raise a lot of troubling new questions, was counsel's brief bad, should he have raised the brief, a question that he didn't, should he have raised a petition for rehearing and all things like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.938" offset="6694091">It is a very, very disturbing area to get into, and it's potential.</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.604" offset="6804746">Mr. Chief Justice, in regard to the mootness question that you raised with Mr. Henry, the last time I talked to my client, which was about ten days ago, he was very much interested in continuing his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.911" offset="6849990">Since 1977 he has wanted a direct appeal from his conviction in the Madison Circuit Court, and he still wants that appeal because he thinks he was unjustly convicted there and he does want to clear his name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.988" offset="6902340">But that was ten days ago before I realized, from the benefit of Mr. Henry's letter to this Court, that his sentence has been eliminated, and he is no longer under any type of restrictions from his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.963" offset="6954271">But I think that this Court has to also look and examine at the question of whether or not this case is capable of repetition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1724.376" offset="7031907">In Kentucky, he received a... Mr. Lucey received a ten year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.261" offset="7051447">At the time of their admission to prison, they are given a good time credit of one quarter of their sentence, so that reduces it to seven and a half years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1810.998" offset="7378395">Now, on November 15 of this year I have an argument before the Supreme Court of Kentucky on exactly the issue that is before the Court right now, whether or not there is effective assistance of counsel standard for counsel on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.824" offset="7441716">The Stahl decision may seem to have cured that situation from its language, from its apparent language, but the Stahl decision was handed down by the Supreme Court of Kentucky solely because the Supreme... excuse me, the Sixth Circuit in an earlier case of Cleaver v. Bordenkircher in 1980 directed the Supreme Court of Kentucky to do the same thing they did in Stahl in the Cleaver case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.308" offset="7551639">This case has been... this issue, excuse me, has been before the Sixth Circuit in cases arising out of Kentucky to my knowledge on five different occasions because I have been involved in those cases, as has my opponent, Mr. Henry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.269" offset="7611407">We have a situation where Kentucky... and Justice Blackmun, let me explain the significance of England v. Spalding because, interestingly enough, under the present procedures in Kentucky as they are implemented, if the same factual circumstances in Lucey occurred today, the case would not be dismissed, the Supreme Court of Kentucky or the Court of Appeals of Kentucky would issue what is called a deficiency statement, and because it is a nonjurisdictional matter, would give counsel a limited amount of time to cure that error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.193" offset="7759156">And that makes it all the more egregious the situation that Mr. Lucey finds himself in today, without ever having the opportunity to raise the challenges to his conviction, to be able, in the words of this Court, to have an attorney marshal arguments for him, to present and organize law, and to present the facts of his conviction to an appellate court for some sort of review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2688.751" offset="10889357">Anders v. California, also in '67, setting out the standards for appellate counsel, that it has to be more than an amicus for an indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.024" offset="10926451">And this Court said that what has to be done is that the indigent must be given the same benefits of someone who has the money to retain counsel.</text>
