            <label>Mr. Arthur R. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="90.391" offset="494823">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.962" offset="513108">The two issues in this case are, first, whether the state of Kansas, consistent with the notions of individual liberty and interstate federalism imbedded in the due process clause and the full faith and credit clause may assert jurisdiction and enter a binding judgment affecting thousands of non-residents of Kansas who have had no contacts with Kansas and whose oil and gas royalty interest claims have absolutely nothing to do with Kansas and when there is no legitimate public policy of Kansas implicated in the action, and second, whether Kansas can indiscriminately apply Kansas law to each and every one of these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.327" offset="722506">The petitioner asserts that the answer to both of these questions is in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.964" offset="745076">In an unbroken line of cases starting with International Shoe and moving through Hanson and Denckla, and most recently further articulated in the Woodson case, for 40 years this Court has established a constitutional requirement that minimum contacts must exist between a party and a state before that state can assert jurisdiction over that party, that there must be a relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation, to use language from those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.593" offset="915603">As fully articulated in Justice White's opinion in the Woodson case, that minimum contact standard serves as a principal, realistic, and flexible instrument protecting two values.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.937" offset="981014">First is the liberty interest of the individual not to be subjected to litigation in a forum with which he or she has not voluntarily affiliated.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.161" offset="1029915">The second objective of the minimum contacts test is to limit the authority of each state within the context of the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.218" offset="1074114">That means that I as a citizen of Massachusetts, and Mr. Kubbich of Phillips Petroleum as a citizen of Oklahoma, has an individual liberty interest not to be burdened, not to be affected, not to have his property rights or personal rights affected by a state that he has not affiliated with.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.130" offset="1345788">This Court has said several times that a cause of action is a property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.702" offset="1376090">It has said that in the Zimmerman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.904" offset="1388837">It has said it in effect in the Mullane case.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.189" offset="1402003">It has said it in Boddie.</text>

            <text syncTime="321.307" offset="1418512">In a sense it has said it in the Dunleavy case many, many years ago, that there really is no difference between my being held liable for $10 and my claim of $10 being foreclosed by the judicial action of the state of Kansas, that I have an individual liberty interest unless I have affiliated with Kansas.</text>

            <text syncTime="444.269" offset="1910346">In that situation, this Court said that those Floridians had a direct, substantial personal interest in the outcome of that jurisdictional question, in part, of course, because the Delaware trustee was declared by Florida law to be indispensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.765" offset="1992266">We believe that the non-resident, non-volitional plaintiff class members are also indispensable parties to their own claims, just as that Delaware trust was indispensable in the Hansen case.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.080" offset="2293510">If you believe that each of the non-resident class members has a constitutional right to make up his own mind as to whether his piece of property is to be put on the litigation chessboard, then it seems to me that if, to go back to Justice O'Connor's reference to the opt-in class, if Kansas wishes to expand its class action power, then its invitation to non-residents, its invitation to those with whom it has no constitutional affiliation, must come at a moment in time that is meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.972" offset="2453170">If one looks at the class action statute of Kansas, which is virtually but not completely identical to Federal Rule 23, you discover that the notice provided for and the opt-out right and the representation provided for by the Kansas class action statute comes after certification, which we submit is not a rational time at which the non-resident class member can exercise his right to participate or not participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.010" offset="2581275">This case is a classic illustration of that, because three years went by between the institution of the action and the notice to the absent class members.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.084" offset="2633624">Justice O'Connor asked about our standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.304" offset="2646477">Well, we were the only game in town.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.839" offset="2660583">You cannot expect the class representative to assert the lack of jurisdiction over 28,000 of his troops.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.695" offset="2699975">That is unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.147" offset="2705827">You cannot expect the non-resident class members to assert the jurisdiction issue between institution and notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.770" offset="2744279">They have no notice of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.653" offset="2751802">We were obliged under the normal rules of assertion of threshold defenses to make the jurisdictional objection prior to answer and litigate it, as we did, in a fully adversarial context.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.663" offset="2811884">I don't think there can be any doubt about the completeness of this issue or the zealotry with which we have pursued this issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1370.346" offset="5614614">First, when you look at the structure of Shutts II, and it is very important to understand that Shutts II and Shutts I are two entirely different cases, they are not the same case in a later manifestation, you see that what the state of Kansas did without citing Hague is literally say, we have jurisdiction here, and absent compelling reasons, we are going to apply Kansas law across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.532" offset="5735404">And then, in what might be called all fruits are apples approach, the state of Kansas said all of these contracts are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.107" offset="5777618">The truth of the matter is, all the contracts are not the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.125" offset="5793709">Some of the contracts that Phillips has, particularly with producers as opposed to royalty owners, are no interest contracts that do not call for payment until the end of the suspense royalty period, and explicitly say no interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.670" offset="5871868">We know from the Supreme Court of Texas in a post-Shutts I, pre-Shutts II opinion that the state of Texas would enforce that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.010" offset="5921291">The state of Kansas chose to ignore that in favor of Kansas's perception of what is fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.247" offset="5950235">Second, the official statutory interest rates in the other states, particularly Texas, the most dominant state, Oklahoma, Louisiana, New Mexico, Wyoming, range between 6 and 7 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.356" offset="6014705">The state of Kansas chose to use what is called the FERC rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.927" offset="6036961">That is a rate that applies between the interstate pipeline companies and a producer like Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.533" offset="6071339">It has absolutely nothing to do with royalty owners.</text>

            <text syncTime="1488.920" offset="6088893">Kansas said its notions of fairness, favoring the royalty owners, caused the application of the FERC rate under Kansas law which averages 11 to 13 percent, whereas we know from the Stahl case that the state of Texas would have applied its statutory 6 percent rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.945" offset="7400971">But it is entirely different after judgment, and that is true, Justice Rehnquist, with respect to a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.616" offset="7423750">Let me give you an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.749" offset="7428243">A defendant comes into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.635" offset="7435766">He makes a special appearance and contests jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.753" offset="7448201">The court rules he has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.955" offset="7457082">They proceed to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.939" offset="7460948">The defendant wins on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.756" offset="7468263">The plaintiff can't appeal and say we wouldn't have had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.792" offset="7484354">Once there is a judgment, the equation changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.394" offset="7498774">Now, Phillips says in this Court, it says we have suffered injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.631" offset="7515806">That satisfies the case in controversy requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.916" offset="7528867">But this Court has made clear time and again injury alone is not sufficient to invoke jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.356" offset="7558646">Everybody up here seeking a reverse of judgment has suffered injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.474" offset="7575156">That is by definition the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.724" offset="7584142">In order to reverse the judgment, you have to invoke your rights, or in limited circumstances the rights of an allied party, such as when the Court has said a doctor can use a patient's rights, but never, in no case, and Phillips cites none, has the Court suggested that a party could raise his adversary's rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1907.603" offset="7763655">But it is an entirely different matter, it must be, once the person has a judgment, to say you are going to raise his rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2239.545" offset="9091407">But even these questions show why this case is a bad vehicle to resolve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.199" offset="9114081">There are questions about, what about if you didn't get the notice?</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.151" offset="9125889">Suppose he got it late.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.485" offset="9131218">How about counterclaims?</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.187" offset="9138010">How about court costs?</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.603" offset="9143652">All of those matters are not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.304" offset="9158490">We have to conjecture about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.940" offset="9164968">None of them were presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.356" offset="9170610">If we have a case from a class member, we will hear exactly what the graveman of his complaint is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.844" offset="9192658">And it is clear that this Court doesn't decide cases on conjecture, and that is what Phillips is asking you do to, especially when you have a party who wants a conjecture in the wrong direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.235" offset="9238215">So let me turn to the merits, because again, the rule here is to protect the absent class member, not to protect Phillips, but I think you look at the rule that Phillips espouses, you will see that in the name of the absent class members Phillips is shielding itself from litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.113" offset="9309686">Now, the Kansas courts provided all class members with the following protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.183" offset="9333928">First, adequate representation through the named plaintiffs and their counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.402" offset="9350855">Second, first class mail notice that had to be delivered describing the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.539" offset="9375410">Third, a right to participate in person or through that person's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.127" offset="9397771">And fourth, a right to opt-out simply by signing a form included with the notice and sending it to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.965" offset="9425148">Predictably, Phillips argues that that is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.334" offset="9438522">It says there must also be a showing of minimum contacts between the non-resident class member in the forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.821" offset="9468511">Phillips reaches this conclusion, we submit, by ignoring significant and almost obvious differences between plaintiff class members and defendants, differences that we believe justify a different constitutional due process approach to protecting the rights of both groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.835" offset="9548550">Now, a defendant, of course, rarely wants to be in court at all, and certainly we know, we take it as a given that when he is opposing jurisdiction, he doesn't want to be in that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.225" offset="9598183">If he did, and Phillips neglects this with its interstate federalism argument, and it neglects the Court's holding in Insurance Company versus Ireland, if the defendant wants to be in a court, he is free to come in at any time irrespective of the federalism arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.004" offset="9661295">Now, starting from that premise... you have to realize every minimum contacts case so far has started from the premise that the party doesn't want to be in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.377" offset="9706748">When you start from that premise, what the Court has said, there are limits as to which courts we can require him to litigate in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.316" offset="9742483">Now, let's turn to a plaintiff class member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.619" offset="9755753">A plaintiff class member doesn't face the exposure that a defendant faces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.921" offset="9776965">He has not made an objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.540" offset="9787414">Instead, the fact is, a class member has a claim that he wants asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.027" offset="9809357">He wants to have it heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.046" offset="9817402">What is the problem?</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.379" offset="9822731">The problem is, when the small claimant has a claim, the costs of litigation are so high that he is prohibited, in effect, from asserting his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.437" offset="9862960">Now, as this Court has recognized in Deposit Guaranty versus Roper and elsewhere, the class action is designed to overcome that hurdle, to facilitate the plaintiff's access to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.761" offset="9916250">Thus the class action, in contrast to what a defendant faces when he goes into court, the plaintiff faces no risk and no cost unless he prevails, in which case a portion of his fee is paid for the attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.354" offset="9978630">Now, given that circumstance, the plaintiff's circumstance, it is impossible, we submit, that a minimum contacts requirement could protect him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.229" offset="10018127">Rather, what it will do is limited the potential forums that he can have his claim heard in, and he will be in a different position from the other plaintiffs in cases like Keeton versus Hustler who, because they have large claims, can go to their forums.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.004" offset="10085210">Now, in the present case, for example, Phillips says, and we agree, that most of these class members would not meet the minimum contacts test in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.777" offset="10120318">As a result, their claim in the name of protecting their rights would have been barred from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.200" offset="10146023">Now, it may be that there would have been other cases filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.402" offset="10158875">It may be we can speculate that because Phillips is in Oklahoma, sort of, that would be okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.972" offset="10181131">All of that is speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.789" offset="10188341">The fact is that the large majority of these people would have been denied their day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.393" offset="10214777">Now, Phillips says, and we agree, a class member may have an interest in not involuntarily being brought into a particular class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.267" offset="10254274">The reason he might have that interest is, he might want to assert a claim on his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.552" offset="10271410">Or he might want to join another class action, or for whatever reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.254" offset="10286248">But Kansas recognizes that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.575" offset="10299518">It provides an opt-out procedure that is clear and easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.027" offset="10317386">Once again, Phillips says the opt-out procedure is not adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.931" offset="10336926">It instead would require an opt-in procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.216" offset="10350091">Unfortunately, the large body of scholarly and judicial opinion that has looked at the area has decided almost unanimously that an opt-out procedure better protects the class members than an opt-in procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.075" offset="10413517">Thus, the federal rules and virtually every state court's rules require an opt-out procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.831" offset="10444550">They do so not to harm the absent class member but to help him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.152" offset="10465866">Judge Kaplan, then Professor Kaplan, who is a recorder for the rules, he explained the way this came about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.222" offset="10494078">He said, we have to be especially concerned about the relatively small claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.960" offset="10513095">He said, this is somebody, if he is not included in the class, is likely to have no opportunity to have his claim heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.114" offset="10541726">He said nevertheless a small claimant is often unsophisticated, and as a result of what he called timidity or ignorance or unsophistication about business or legal matters, might decline to execute an opt-in forum, but that person should be protected in the class, and yet it is that person in the name of protecting his rights that Phillips would knock out from this class action altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.181" offset="10653948">And Phillips would then suggest to the Court, well, the solution is that there be a few others, or maybe one other, or there be one with an opt-in provision, but if there is an opt-in provision, and Professor Kaplan and everybody else who has looked at the matter is right, then that opt-in provision won't protect people, and whether or not there will be other actions we have no idea.</text>

            <text syncTime="3151.359" offset="12738624">Now, this Court said as long ago as 1908 that a state could prevent a corporation from practicing, from doing business within its jurisdiction if it committed an antitrust violation in another jurisdiction that had no impact in the home jurisdiction, so a state does have an interest, a recognized interest in preventing or in regulating a corporation's dealings with other states.</text>

            <text syncTime="3220.271" offset="13014372">That is the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.206" offset="13018029">Now, here, let's look at what they did, because I think it is important to understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.424" offset="13034957">There is a federal price approval system that deals with retroactive prices for gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.228" offset="13062124">Because of that, we have suspense royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.430" offset="13074976">That is the reason we have the problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.599" offset="13083649">The federal government says, if you hold the money, you have to pay interest to the fellow you sold it to at this specific rate if we disallow the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.190" offset="13134013">That is the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.342" offset="13138610">As a result of that, they hold the royalty owner's money, exactly as if they had held the producer's money, exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.729" offset="13168181">And what does the Kansas court say?</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.598" offset="13175600">We will apply that federal principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.782" offset="13188348">The federal law created it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.501" offset="13195244">We will apply it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.734" offset="13200155">There is nothing arcane or provincial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.020" offset="13209350">In fact, Phillips itself uses that exact rate when it demands interest from royalty owners in the precise circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.976" offset="13245190">When you take those facts, we submit that there was nothing arbitrary and unfair in the Kansas court uniformly applying the law that it did, enshrined in Kansas law, to the identical claims of the class member.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur R. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="3297.104" offset="13321677">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.040" offset="13329409">We believe on the standing question that the Article III requirement is clearly satisfied by the impact of this Kansas judgment on Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.299" offset="13382385">The question of so-called third party standing, which has been raised by several of the Justices, is a prudential doctrine, pure and simple, be applied to assure the necessary adversarial and concreteness in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.225" offset="13446124">In Craig versus Boren, Justice Brennan, writing for the Court, said that these prudential objectives cannot be furthered here where the lower court already has entertained a relevant constitutional challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.466" offset="13503071">In such circumstances, a decision by us to forego consideration of the constitutional challenge to the statute by injured third parties would be impermissibly to foster repetitive and time consuming litigation under the guise of caution and prudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.796" offset="13580393">As this Court well knows, this issue was up here two and one half years ago in Miner versus Gillette.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.866" offset="13608710">At that time, the party in the position of Phillips was told, you have no final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.104" offset="13633683">Now to be told that you have no standing, and to wait for the hypothetical collateral attack to occur while the states are reaching inconsistent results on this issue... keep in mind that New Jersey and Pennsylvania take a different view, take the view that Phillips is asserting here... leads to destabilization in the national class action context at the very moment in time when this phenomenon is mushrooming.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.289" offset="13750398">So, we believe that there clearly is standing from a prudential point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.343" offset="13766594">Second, let me remind the Court that it has said that the issue of jurisdiction is analytically prerequisite to the issues of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.335" offset="13818526">That statement, analytically prerequisite, is from Rush versus Savchuk, where you had a nominal defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.507" offset="13851231">This Court in Baldwin years ago, most recently in Bank of Ireland, said that an individual is free to ignore proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.529" offset="13891355">The right to ignore proceedings is taken away by saying that Kansas can assert jurisdiction over non-resident, non-volitional class members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.087" offset="13933569">In the Churry case years ago, and again in Bank of Ireland just a couple of years ago, this Court said that a state cannot conclude interested parties by the mere assertion of its own power.</text>

            <text syncTime="3490.581" offset="14095528">But there are many ways Kansas can do it without shoving aside the individual liberty interests, the interstate federal interests, let alone the choice of law sovereignty interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.972" offset="14145161">Kansas could create a legitimate opt-in and invite people to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.607" offset="14163655">Kansas could sweeten the class action pot by awarding as a statutory matter treble damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="3519.064" offset="14209526">If Kansas is really interested in the small claimant, it could create a patens patriae action.</text>
