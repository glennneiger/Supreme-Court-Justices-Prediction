            <label>Mr. David Berman</label>
            <text syncTime="15.801" offset="195609">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, on June 4th, 1979, the school officials of the town of Burlington conducted a core evaluation to determine the appropriate future placement for Michael Panico, a learning disabled child who is handicapped within the meaning of the Education of the Handicapped Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.603" offset="314832">As a result of that evaluation, they determined that the appropriate placement for this child was a Classroom in the Pine Glen School, which is a public school of the town of Burlington.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.253" offset="389437">This was a classroom for children with special needs, and it was taught by a teacher named John McAleer, who had had considerable success in dealing with children of special needs, especially children with learning disabilities and reading disabilities such as Michael then had.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.468" offset="482329">The plan contemplated that Michael would take mathematics sooner or later, but hopefully sooner, with non-handicapped students, and that he would be immediately integrated with non-handicapped students in such non-academic subjects as athletics, music, and art.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.247" offset="597477">Before the plan was even committed to paper, Michael's parents made up their mind to reject it, and they did reject it as soon as they got it, on July 3rd; 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.160" offset="673127">On July 17th, 1979, his parents appeal to the Bureau of Special Education Appeals of the Department of Education of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and sough a hearing on their complaint that the IEP was inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.823" offset="763720">That date is a very important date, because at least as of that date proceedings were pending pursuant to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.341" offset="809800">In August of 1979, Michael was enrolled in a private school in Lincoln, Massachusetts, exclusively for children with learning disabilities, known as the Carroll School.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Berman</label>
            <text syncTime="205.125" offset="952951">I am informed now, Your Honor, that the youngster is in a private school in Beverly, Massachusetts, called the Landmark School.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.063" offset="992657">At least that is where he was When I was last informed of his whereabouts.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.746" offset="1007390">Now, the hearing officer conducting proceedings in the months of September, October, and November of 1979, and on January 31st, 1980, she rendered a decision, and in her decision, she made certain findings and rulings which are not necessarily consistent with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.034" offset="1124628">But first of all, she said, yes, this IEP, this individual educational plan... I will call it an IEP henceforth... was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.521" offset="1162557">She said that Mr. McAleer was indeed an excellent teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.934" offset="1184187">She noted the Carroll School was a private school exclusively for children with learning disabilities, and she noted that the Pine Glen School was a public school with opportunities for main streaming a child, which is the word that is used to describe taking a handicapped child, as federal law requires, and putting him into the mainstream of activity with non handicapped children.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.590" offset="1286796">Nevertheless, she did not uphold the IEP that was written earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.446" offset="1322218">She said, first of all, that Michael needed a form of teaching reading known as Orton-Gillingham, that he needed small classes, that he needed a supporting peer group, meaning other children who have learning disabilities, and he needed freedom from distraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.120" offset="1412915">Now, except with respect to the supporting peer group, petitioners have never doubted that Michael needed all these things, but they never could understand why that would be a basis for rejecting their plan, since he would have received all of them at the Pine Glen School from Mr. McAleer.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.136" offset="1508941">Finally, she said over a long period of time these school authorities have violated any number of procedural rights that belong to this child, and therefore I doubt whether they have the capacity to implement this plan in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.122" offset="1600892">Now, again, it is very unclear just what she meant by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.623" offset="1614894">Did she mean that the school authorities were going to yank this child out of the class in the middle of the year or do something like that?</text>
            <text syncTime="378.640" offset="1646972">No one can really answer that question, I think, very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.743" offset="1663377">If that is what she meant, she certainly had no basis whatsoever for making that kind of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.918" offset="1688141">On February 26, 1980, less than a month after that opinion was rendered, the petitioners, who are the School Committee of the Town of Burlington and the town itself, brought an action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts under Title 20 of the United States Code, Section 1415(e)(2).</text>

            <text syncTime="415.976" offset="1796393">Mr. Berman, does it strike you as at all odd that Congress should have given the school authorities the right to appeal from the superintendent of education's decision to the federal court?</text>

            <text syncTime="429.464" offset="1850309">Well, no, it doesn't, Your Honor, really, strike me as odd, although I am constrained to admit that it did strike me odd when I first thought about the statute, and I thought, why would Congress want to give the school authorities this kind of power to seek review?</text>
            <text syncTime="446.724" offset="1919377">But then I realized what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.776" offset="1931498">Congress realized that education of the handicapped was to be a joint effort, and it was a joint effort that involved the parents, that involved the states, and that involved the local educational authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.478" offset="2002342">And I think Congress recognized that local educational authorities, Your Honor, have an interest in seeing that the programs that they spend vast amounts of money to set up are vindicated in the courts, if need be, 'and that it is made clear through the courts that they are capable of educating handicapped children, because that is what they are supposed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.487" offset="2106414">They are not supposed to dump handicapped children on the private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.249" offset="2125431">They are supposed to integrate them into the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.872" offset="2139955">So that is why I think Congress gave the local educational authority that right to seek review.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.927" offset="2172138">Now, in July of 1980... this is about five months after the action was brought... the school authorities asked Mr. Panico if he would make his son available for a new evaluation that would have led perhaps to a new or amended IEP.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.753" offset="2275478">Mr. Panico flatly said no, I will not do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.737" offset="2295436">A few months later, Mr. Panico said, well, maybe I will do it, but you have to hire all new people, who have no connection with your school, if you want me to cooperate, and that is something that of course the school authorities refused to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.256" offset="2349457">In February of 1981, the Department of Education threatened to cut off all of the federal funds to the petitioners unless they started funding Michael's education, which was way past the IEP, I should point out, way past the year for which the IEP was drawn at the Carroll School.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.315" offset="2465754">Faced with that ultimatum, the School Committee did start in February of 1981 to pay for the tuition of Michael at the Carroll School, and pay for his transportation, with the strict understanding, however, that if the petitioners prevailed after a trial, the petitioners would have that money reimbursed to them, and indeed, that understanding is enshrined in the first opinion that was to be rendered by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in this case, and that was rendered in June of 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.453" offset="2642237">In May of 1982, there was a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.570" offset="2674734">The judge took the hearing officer's decision as prima facie evidence on all acts therein stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.997" offset="2712455">She said the burden of proof was on the school department, petitioners here, for the year 1979-1980, and for subsequent years the burden of proof was on the parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.494" offset="2774417">The trial produced on both sides unusually competent expert testimony, and... I say both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.604" offset="2826871">I Should say on the side of the parents and on the side of the School Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.006" offset="2844425">The Department of Education offered no evidence at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.469" offset="2858322">But one thing about that testimony I think is terribly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.792" offset="2879638">The respondent's expert, Dr. Levine, never stated an opinion as to what was an appropriate placement.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.251" offset="2925405">He wouldn't touch that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.173" offset="2937108">The petitioner's expert, Dr. Kinsmore, was very forthright on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.496" offset="2958424">He said that not only did he find the Pine Glen School to be the equal of the Carroll School, he thought it was superior to the Carroll School.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.713" offset="2995308">He pointed out that the progress that the child had made in three years a to the Carroll School had been no better than the child's progress during his first three years when he wasn't in any special school at all, but was merely getting one hour of tutorial at the Memorial School.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.583" offset="3062809">And both doctors agreed... a very important point, I dare say... that the type of remediation that would have been offered at the Pine Glen School was a good remediation for this child.</text>

            <text syncTime="815.467" offset="3394355">I would like to address 1415(e)(3) first.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.514" offset="3430508">And this is a statute which says,</text>
            <text syncTime="831.466" offset="3458303">"During the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this section, unless the state or local educational agency and the parents or guardian otherwise agree, the child shall remain in the then current educational placement of such child, or if applying for initial admission to a public school, shall with the consent of the parent or guardian be place in the public school program until all such proceedings have been complete. "</text>
            <text syncTime="866.771" offset="3599573">Now, I deliberately read both clauses of that statute, not just the first clause, because one of the arguments that respondents make in their briefs, especially the respondent Panico, is that this statute only bars the local educational agency or the state educational agency from changing the placement of a child while proceedings are pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.699" offset="3703227">It has no bar whatsoever against the parents, and that can't be, because in the second clause, the very same sentence of this statute, when Congress intended to say that only the consent of the parents is needed, it said so in very clear language.</text>

            <text syncTime="1265.202" offset="5193251">Oh, before I get to that, the word "agree".</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.004" offset="5204432">Both respondents argue that where the parents prevail at the administrative or due process level, as it is sometimes called, there has been an agreement with respect to placement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.718" offset="5283321">I disagree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.470" offset="5294293">What they have really done when they have written that is to suggest that when Congress said during proceedings under this section, they really meant proceedings under 1415(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.973" offset="5368376">That is not what Congress said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.635" offset="5386975">Congress did not say proceedings under 1415(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.765" offset="5395544">It said, while proceedings under this section are pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.897" offset="5408082">Now, what the parents really argue, and I think this is the heart of their argument, is that if 1415(e)(3) is construed as Congress wrote it, it is unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.116" offset="5456879">It will not accomplish its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.099" offset="5464820">But I think there is a fallacy that runs through that argument, and the fallacy is that most placements are going to be bad; parents are going to be right most of the time, school authorities are going to be wrong most of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.161" offset="5545068">If you take the reverse of that proposition and assume that most of the time, as was the case here, the school authorities will be right and the parents will be wrong when they disagree, and if you allow room for agreement, for a new interim placement while proceedings, are pending, and you allow room, as we think you should, for a court to issue a preliminary injunction in cases of an absolutely dreadful placement, then I think the statute will not affect the efficacy of 1415(e)(3) at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.139" offset="5712984">Now, the subject of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.580" offset="5722806">We seem to be involved here in a semantic argument, and I say that with full remembrance of Justice Frankfurter's admonition that most of the business of this Court does involve semantics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.351" offset="5789888">The parents and the School Department say, well, awarding damages, awarding reimbursement is not the same as awarding damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.642" offset="5854985">I don't understand that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.474" offset="5866375">When reimbursement is awarded for prior tuition, that is as much an award of damages as any other kind of damages that you may get, and indeed damages in law very often involve reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.486" offset="5946414">Reliance damages which the Court of Appeals talked about from January of 1980 through June of 1980, I don't understand that either.</text>

            <text syncTime="1524.934" offset="6232193">Petitioners agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.834" offset="6239821">The problem is that when we are talking about procedures, in Rowley this Court was talking about those procedures in 1415 that were meant to safeguard a parent's right to a due process hearing and the parent's right to obtain information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.785" offset="6311606">I don't believe this Court in Rowley, when it suggested that procedures were at the heart of EHA, meant any, any kind of procedure anywhere, no matter how recondite, no matter how technical, to say, well, any time there is a violation of that kind of procedure, there will be damages under EHA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.519" offset="6394570">I don't believe that this is what this Court meant in Rowley, and I think when the Court of Appeals thought it did, it went wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="2529.733" offset="10251393">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I want to address the three factual points that will, I hope, place the question of the appropriate construction of 1415(e)(3) in proper context for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.305" offset="10329656">First of all, the question of whether in this particular case the town and the parents otherwise agreed that the then current placement of Michael Panico should be changed, about that point I think there should be no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.141" offset="10417010">The child was in a school known as the Memorial School.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.755" offset="10435504">He was in a particular kind of placement known in the jargon as a 502.2 prototype, which means that he was in a class, a regular class at least 75 percent of the time, and he was going to be in a special class 25 percent of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.500" offset="10522440">Now, in the spring of 1979, what the school proposed was to change that placement, to change his then current placement in two senses of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.877" offset="10567997">First, physically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.099" offset="10576879">They were going to move him to a totally different school, the Pine Glen School.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.211" offset="10589313">Secondly, they were going to put him in a different type of prototype, namely, a 502.4 prototype, which means that the child would have been in a substantially more restricted placement in which he was in the school in a special class at least 75 percent of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.134" offset="10676980">Now, the parents and the school both agreed that the child's then current placement was not appropriate, so on the facts of this case it appears to me that the entire operation of 1415(e)(3) does not even come into play.</text>

            <text syncTime="2933.972" offset="11868373">They had been told by, among other people, a reading specialist in the school, the Burlington schools, a Catherine Black, that the proposed... placement proposed by the town was not appropriate for that child.</text>

            <text syncTime="2987.306" offset="12081637">Do they place the child in the proposed placement which their... the people they had consulted, including a school teacher, had informed them was inappropriate for the child, or do they in fact place the child in the placement they believed was appropriate, go through the hearing process, and if at the end of the hearing process their decision or their belief was upheld, then the hearing officer or eventually the court in their view would retroactively grant them tuition reimbursement from the beginning of the year.</text>

            <text syncTime="3139.094" offset="12688827">Now, let's assume because it is really the difficult task in front of this Court that it is clear that the child's... that the parents did something that the town characterizes as 1415(e)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.938" offset="12756223">Let's assume that the placement was changed unilaterally by the parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.850" offset="12783808">Now, in my view, the statute on its face does not contain the sanction or the bar or the jurisdictional elements that the town would urge this Court to accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.984" offset="12852353">There is nothing on the face of the statute which says, if you "violate" the statute, you lose your right to reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.357" offset="12889865">Now, I have argued in our brief that the real point of this section was that in fact prior to the passage of the Act there was a practice of excluding children from the public schools who were handicapped and excluding or, more appropriately, dumping children, as the phrase is called, into inappropriate classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.296" offset="12997594">I believe that this statute was in fact enacted based on the consent decree, as in the Mills and Park case, which I have cited, to prevent a school department from excluding the child without parental consent during the pendency of those actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.549" offset="13078678">And there is some support beyond my simply asserting it in the Department of Education's own interpretations of this section, although it is a scant reference to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.429" offset="13142208">There is an appendix to the regulations in which the department gives interpretive rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.283" offset="13173555">One of the interpretive rulings deals with what this section means, and says, among other things, if because of the disagreement over the IEP a hearing is initiated by either the parents or agency, the agency may not change the child's placement unless the parents and agency agree otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.110" offset="13264879">Now, in my view, if the Court were to reach the reverse result, that the parents were disabled from receiving tuition reimbursement once they had "unilaterally withdrawn" the child from the school system, and if two years later that child is eventually found by the hearing officer to have been... or, more appropriately, the parents' placement was appropriate, and the school's chosen placement was inappropriate, then for that two-year period that child will have been denied either the appropriate portion of the free appropriate public education to which he or she had been entitled, or if the parents pay for that placement during the two years, then the child will have been denied the free portion of the free, appropriate public education.</text>
