            <text syncTime="23.257" offset="235868">In order to implement this change in the law, it was not necessary for a state to gather any new information about any recipient or to make any new factual determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.336" offset="284142">Instead, the state merely had to make a small mathematical change in the formula used for computing benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.931" offset="318519">Before the amendment, 20 percent of earned income was disregarded in calculating benefits, and after the amendment 18 percent of earned income was disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.749" offset="365853">Both of the lower courts below in this case held that the due process clause prohibited Massachusetts from implementing this simple mathematical change without providing advanced notice to all affected recipients explaining to them exactly how their new benefit amounts had been calculated.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito</label>
            <text syncTime="143.838" offset="718193">I assume they would adhere to their decision based on their erroneous view of what the due process clause requires, and in the brief time that is allotted to me this afternoon, I want to argue that in the situation involved in this case, advance notice is not constitutionally necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.348" offset="784230">Counsel for Massachusetts will then assume for the sake of argument that some form of notice is necessary, and will argue that the notice furnished in this case satisfied statutory and regulatory requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.917" offset="834490">Let me make clear at the outset exactly what our submission is.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.988" offset="850790">We acknowledge that the due process clause requires notice and a hearing when a state terminates or reduces benefits based on a factual determination about the recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.877" offset="894363">That is the situation in Goldberg versus Kelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.960" offset="906692">But we don't think the same rule applies here, where there is no new factual determination, where the only thing that had to occur was a new computation using data that was already in the file and already in use.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.357" offset="960296">Why is this so?</text>
            <text syncTime="205.729" offset="965729">First of all, I think it is quite clear that the due process clause does not restrict Congress's authority to change the level of food stamp benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.153" offset="1003450">A food stamp recipient has a property interest in receiving the level of benefits specified by law at any particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.472" offset="1040753">The recipient doesn't have a property interest in getting any greater benefits, and the recipient doesn't have a vested interest in getting future benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.216" offset="1071682">So, if Congress amends the law and reduces benefits, as it did in 1981, it does not deprive the recipient of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.940" offset="1102611">It merely redefines the recipient's property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.713" offset="1117657">Now, since the plaintiffs in this case, who were food stamp recipients, had no vested interest in continuing to receive benefits at the pre-1981 level, one may well ask on what theory they claimed that implementation of the 1981 reduction deprived them of property and triggered the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.569" offset="1205115">And their theory, as I understand it, is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.448" offset="1216609">First, they correctly note that they have a property interest in getting the right amount of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.352" offset="1240224">Then they say this interest is threatened when the law is changed, because the risk of administrative accident in calculating benefits increases at this time of confusion, and therefore they say we are entitled to advance notice explaining to us how our new benefit level was calculated so that we can double check the state's computation.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.016" offset="1322875">Now, the first thing that is wrong with this theory in our view is the premise that a great risk of administrative error occurs when a simple mathematical change like that enacted in 1981 is implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.088" offset="1383166">This premise is devoid of empirical support, and it is intuitively incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.748" offset="1397794">This is a simple mathematical operation, and it does not give rise to a great risk of error, but assuming that it is correct for the sake of argument, let me briefly explore some of the implications of this theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.828" offset="1450144">First of all, for all the talk about reductions in food stamp benefits, it turns out that it doesn't matter under this theory that benefits were reduced in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.043" offset="1487029">All that matters is that the law was changed, and therefore plaintiffs claimed the risk of error increased, so the theory would logically apply just as well if Congress had increased benefits in 1981 or if it had simply made some other alteration in the formula for computing benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.076" offset="1559127">Second, it is clear that this theory extends far beyond food stamps, and let me give just two examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.979" offset="1586712">A state decides to increase the salaries of its employees to reflect an increase in the cost of living.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.295" offset="1615969">State employees have a property interest in getting the salaries specified by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.138" offset="1635404">A Change in the pay scale is a mass change in the law, so according to the plaintiffs that increases the risk of administrative error.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.252" offset="1663825">So under their theory state employees are entitled to advanced notice as a constitutional requirement explaining how their new salaries were calculated.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.978" offset="1698725">Another example.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.838" offset="1706144">Tax rates have been charged several times in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.231" offset="1719728">This has affected the amount withheld from wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.924" offset="1734565">Wage earners have a property interest in their wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.215" offset="1743656">Charging the tax rates is a mass change in the law, so under the plaintiff's theory, wage earners were entitled to advanced notice specifying how their new wage levels were calculated.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.954" offset="1794647">And I think plaintiffs' theory goes further still, because what really triggers, what directly triggers the due process clause under that theory is not the change in the law but the increase in the risk of administrative error.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.081" offset="1847101">So what if the risk increases for some other reason?</text>
            <text syncTime="429.076" offset="1859117">The state gets a new computer program, gets a new computer.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.146" offset="1871447">There is a fire at the computer center.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.429" offset="1880537">Logically the theory should apply there as well, but then I am not even sure why an increase in the risk of error should matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.733" offset="1909794">What if the normal, everyday error rate in a non-computerized state is higher than even the increased error rate in a state like Massachusetts when it implements a change in the law?</text>
            <text syncTime="453.931" offset="1958591">Is the non-computerized state then under some kind of perpetual duty to give out notice every time it issues a check?</text>
            <text syncTime="460.035" offset="1982937">All of this, of course, is absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.757" offset="1993804">The due process clause requires notice and a hearing when there is a real and imminent threat to a property or liberty interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.431" offset="2028495">Now, there is such a threat in the Goldberg versus Kelly situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.575" offset="2045109">The state makes a factual finding about the individual and concludes that the individual is ineligible for benefits, but there is no such threat here.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.332" offset="2084188">The only threat is the statistical chance that an accident is going to happen, but for all of us there is always the chance that the government is going to accidentally deprive us of life, liberty, or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.750" offset="2137791">The elevator in this building may crash, but that does not mean that we all have a due process right to advance notice and a hearing on the issue of elevator maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.845" offset="2178229">Respondents... the plaintiffs in this case have the last word on this constitutional question in their reply brief, and it seems to me that they ended up by conceding virtually everything that I have just said.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.099" offset="2247192">On Page 11 of their reply brief, they write,</text>
            <text syncTime="528.752" offset="2257850">"By definition, accidental deprivations of property by the government cannot be predicted, and therefore advanced notice of them is not possible, much less required. "</text>
            <text syncTime="541.219" offset="2307692">"This reality, however, does not lead to the conclusion that no notice is due when the government intends to deprive one of property and will predictably make mistakes in doing so. "</text>
            <text syncTime="552.428" offset="2352518">But here, neither Massachusetts nor the federal government intended to deprive anybody of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.111" offset="2375296">What they intended to do was to see that every recipient got exactly the level of benefits voted by Congress in 1981, no more and no less.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.209" offset="2419705">The plaintiffs in this case are worried only about accidental deprivation of property, but in the case of such accidental occurrences, advanced notice in a hearing is not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.868" offset="2470278">Post-deprivation proceedings are fully sufficient, as this Court held in Parrott versus Taylor.</text>

            <text syncTime="636.221" offset="2687721">So, it must follow that under the food stamp program recipients do not have a vested right in continuing to receive benefits at any particular level.</text>
