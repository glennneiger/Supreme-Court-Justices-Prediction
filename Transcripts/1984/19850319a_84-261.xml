          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="67.025">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="132043">Mr. Kuhlik, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Bruce N. Kuhlik</label>
            <text syncTime="67.025" offset="400059">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="69.827" offset="411344">The question in this case is who is the proper party to control the attorney-client privilege of a corporation in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.166" offset="444676">Our position is straightforward: Control over the privilege rests with the corporation's management.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.487" offset="469963">The bankruptcy trustee manages the debtor corporation and therefore the trustee must have the power to assert or waive the corporation's privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.712" offset="510819">This case arises out of the demise of a commodity brokerage firm, Chicago Discount Commodity Brokers.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.032" offset="540076">Over a period of time, the firm's President, Frank McGhee, who is one of the Respondents in this Court, had embezzled several million dollars in customer funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.256" offset="581036">And by the fall of 1980 the firm's finances were in such disarray that the Commodities Futures Trading Commission filed a complaint in federal court alleging various violations of the Commodities Exchange Act, and the same day that the complaint was filed the brokerage firm, through Frank McGhee, who was at that time its sole remaining officer and director, entered into a consent decree with the Commission that provided for the appointment of a receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.193" offset="700781">John Notz was appointed the receiver and he immediately took control of the firm's operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.446" offset="725754">It quickly became clear to him that really the best course for the firm was to file for bankruptcy and, pursuant to an express authorization in the consent decree, he filed a voluntary petition for liquidation under subchapter IV of chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.141" offset="800569">Now, subchapter IV of chapter 7 is the only bankruptcy avenue available to commodity brokers.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.978" offset="827945">They cannot go into reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.164" offset="836618">Congress had two concerns when it set forth that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.818" offset="859292">The first is with the customers of a commodity broker, whose funds are primarily at risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.971" offset="883847">They are the people that put up the margin payments and the deposits, and it's typically that money that is lost in a commodity brokerage bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.927" offset="915716">Congress was also concerned that the bankruptcy of one commodity broker not have a ripple effect through the complex and interdependent commodity markets and thereby cause problems throughout the futures markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.170" offset="972663">So under these special provisions the trustee, who was Mr. Notz, came in and he operated the commodity brokerage business with a view toward liquidating it and closing out its contracts in an orderly fashion as quickly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.548" offset="1042149">Pursuant to Section 766 of the code, the trustee in a commodity broker bankruptcy must identify contracts that may be transferred to solvent commodity brokers, he must seek customer instructions, he must make and meet margin payments daily, he must be prepared to accept or to deliver commodities in contracts that cannot be closed out before their closing dates.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="255.116" offset="1152490">Mr. Kuhlik, I'm curious about how this process would work.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.770" offset="1175060">Assuming that you are correct ultimately that a trustee in bankruptcy has the power to waive the privilege for the corporation, is that limited in any way?</text>
            <text syncTime="274.010" offset="1228036">In other words, is that qualified by a power to waive it if it will somehow benefit the estate?</text>
            <text syncTime="284.551" offset="1270146">And if so, is it somehow necessary that the trustee would find out first what it is that's going to be waived before making that decision, and how would that be accomplished?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Bruce N. Kuhlik</label>
            <text syncTime="300.078" offset="1332317">You ask a number of questions, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.197" offset="1340781">The trustee in a bankruptcy is a fiduciary who has a responsibility to all of the parties in interest in the proceeding: the creditors, the shareholders, the debtor corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.254" offset="1384980">And it is open to any party at any time to challenge the actions of the trustee as not being in the best interests of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.860" offset="1423432">In fact, it's a fairly common occurrence.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.591" offset="1838361">And what we're talking about here is a question of whether this will be in the best interest of the customers, the creditors, the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.363" offset="1873470">The questions that were asked of Mr. Weintraub with respect to which the privilege was asserted were questions that could not possibly have hurt those groups of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.319" offset="1913281">The only people that could have been harmed were the insiders who engaged... had engaged in fraudulent transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.408" offset="1941597">I would emphasize here that the CFTC is statutorily authorized to seek disgorgement of ill-gotten gains in a proceeding such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.680" offset="1982662">So it was quite apparent to the trustee that the CFTC was seeking to go along the same lines that he himself was, which was to find the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.167" offset="2016621">The customers had put up these funds for margin payments, for deposits, and this money was supposed to be separated... "segregated" is the word that's used in the statute... and not used for any other sort of trading.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.808" offset="2063223">And what happened here was that Mr. McGhee and perhaps other insiders had used this money to trade on their own accounts, and it was quite apparent that the only way this money was going to be recovered was to determine where it had gone, what the insiders had done with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.353" offset="2129365">And I would emphasize, though, again that this is a subpoena enforcement action.</text>

            <text syncTime="665.041" offset="2792144">That is clearly implicit in everything that the trustee is given the power to do in the bankruptcy code.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.397" offset="2821610">And as I say, if the trustee in a particular case has not acted in the best interest of everybody, that action may be challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.318" offset="2853271">The trustee in this case, like other liquidation trustees, has the duty to maximize the value of the estate for all of the parties in interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.608" offset="2894440">The estate in a corporate bankruptcy is composed of all of the corporation's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.762" offset="2918995">Unlike an individual, a corporation doesn't have any exempt property.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.897" offset="2935609">Everything goes into the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.349" offset="2945431">And most significantly perhaps, the estate includes the corporation's causes of action, its litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.689" offset="2974792">Under Section 541 of the code and under bankruptcy rule 6009, the trustee takes control of the corporation's litigation, both its causes of action and its defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.162" offset="3028605">And it would be completely anomalous to suppose that the person who is in control of the corporation's litigation does not have the power to obtain and to control its communications with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.772" offset="3091090">It's simply impossible to see how his function in prosecuting causes of action could be carried out without access to that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.862" offset="3127452">And in this very case, I would note that the trustee has filed over time approximately 75 adversary actions seeking the recovery of approximately $6 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.253" offset="3173010">Because in bankruptcy proceedings the resources of the estate are often quite limited, it would not be unusual for a trustee to cooperate with the Government where, as here, it is apparent that the Government is looking for the same thing that the trustee is, which is the missing money.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.999" offset="3248033">And just that sort of cooperation as we've been discussing was contemplated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.653" offset="3270603">And after the trustee, at the CFTC's request, waived the privilege, the district court ruled that he must answer the questions and the McGhee's, Frank McGhee who I've mentioned and his brother Andrew McGhee, who was a minority shareholder in the firm and a former officer, appealed to the Seventh Circuit, and the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the trustee does not have the power, absolutely doesn't have the power, to waive the corporation's attorney-client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.291" offset="3401111">This conflicts with decisions of the Second, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits and virtually every district and bankruptcy court to consider the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.278" offset="3433085">Now, our position really can be summarized in a nutshell: The privilege of a corporation is controlled by its management, its board of directors or its officers if they're authorized to so act by the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.705" offset="3486792">When a new board of directors takes over in a non-bankruptcy case as a result of a takeover or a merger, shareholder dissatisfaction or the like, it takes control of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.845" offset="3531410">It has access to the privileged communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.045" offset="3540187">It can waive the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.731" offset="3546874">That much is settled corporate law and it's undisputed by the parties here.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.801" offset="3567145">So the question is who manages a debtor corporation in bankruptcy when a trustee has been appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.289" offset="3597134">There can really only be one answer: It's the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.307" offset="3609254">As I've noted, the trustee has power to exercise... can exercise power over all of the corporate property.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.263" offset="3645094">He's under the direct supervision of the bankruptcy court in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.317" offset="3661290">He operates the business in a commodity brokerage bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.018" offset="3676023">He can operate the business in other liquidations, with the approval of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.006" offset="3695981">He has a specific duty to investigate former management to reveal causes of action, to set aside preferential transfers and fraudulent conveyances.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.378" offset="3737463">As I've said, he stands in the shoes of the debtor corporation in prosecuting and defending its causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.682" offset="3762750">We don't think he could do any of these things without--</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.574" offset="5586306">I think what you're raising, though, is perhaps the possibility that attorney-client communications would be chilled, and I want to address that very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.263" offset="5620996">All we are asking the Court to do is to apply the same rule in bankruptcy proceedings that's applied out of bankruptcy, and that is that management controls the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.185" offset="5660703">We are not concerned here with the existence of the privilege or its scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.737" offset="5678988">All we ask is that you not upset the balance struck in non-bankruptcy corporate law, which is that current management controls the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.993" offset="5707932">In any event, the chilling effect that is suggested really disappears upon analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.814" offset="5731233">I would emphasize to the Court that in reorganization proceedings, which are the method of choice for bankruptcies for corporations, the presumption is against having a trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.121" offset="5776477">The presumption is that the officers and directors will stay in as the debtor in possession and control the corporation even in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.560" offset="5814198">When they are not in possession, when a trustee has been appointed, it is often because former management was fraudulent or grossly inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.100" offset="5852441">So if counsel... or if corporate employees were to consider the possibility of bankruptcy, I would suggest that that possibility itself might be remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.658" offset="5902596">But equally importantly, the possibility of having a trustee is quite remote in most proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.914" offset="5927674">Moreover, the trustee won't necessarily waive the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.948" offset="5943765">If the employee is concerned about corporate liability, he can rest assured that the trustee will act in the best interests of the estate, just as would management outside of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.189" offset="5992771">And finally, as you suggested, Justice Stevens, corporate counsel could inform the employee of the possibility that the privilege might be lost, that he doesn't control it, and suggest that the employee seek his own counsel as well if that is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.901" offset="6067586">In sum, where a trustee is appointed in a bankruptcy proceeding the officers and directors have no managerial role to play, either in terms of their powers or their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.477" offset="6117950">Their role is minimal and ministerial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.679" offset="6130698">They must turn over the property of the corporation to the trustee and, significantly, under Section 521 of the code, there's no provision made for assertion of a privilege against the trustee by the debtor corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.939" offset="6187749">The officers and directors or one of their delegates must appear for examination by the creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.176" offset="6220663">But that's really it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.712" offset="6226828">Anything else they do in practical terms tends to further their own interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.532" offset="6254100">If the shareholders wish to have their interests furthered, they can form a committee, just as creditors have committees, and seek to assert their interests that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.554" offset="6290254">But the former management itself has really been, as the House report says, "completely ousted" in favor of the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.862" offset="6331423">They don't have any say in the corporation's liquidation... or litigation, rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.581" offset="6350335">They are likely to be the people most likely to have a conflict of interest with respect to the communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.385" offset="6373532">The trustee, by contrast, is a court-supervised fiduciary who has responsibilities to the entire community of interests in the estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1693.971" offset="6907893">It does not pass in the first instance because Congress has not given it the power to the trustee.</text>

            <text syncTime="3072.354" offset="12421401">In the district court on the subpoena enforcement action, absolutely, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.056" offset="12436239">That's when it came... that's when we found out about it, and we were off and running and briefing it at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.858" offset="12459436">In fact, the only arguments... the only opportunity that there really was to present arguments was at the oral argument, just because of the time constraints in the subpoena enforcement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.864" offset="12491410">It was very much of a last minute idea, very much as the waiver theory, at least in terms of the history of bankruptcy law, is kind of a last minute idea to circumvent what appears to have been the law for a hundred years, that privilege applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.956" offset="12547834">And I would point out, in getting back to the importance of protecting privilege, whether it's individuals or corporations, that if... and I think the Upjohn case... I can't say it better than this Court did in Upjohn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.470" offset="12629859">If you don't have the security of the privilege, if its sanctity is not protected, if it is waivable on a whim by a person who is a stranger, by a person who does not even know the questions that are at issue, by a person who makes assumptions about who's benefited from disclosure, then the privilege isn't worth anything and the privilege is not going to do what the privilege is designed to do, which is to assure both sound advice from counsel and full information to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3175.870" offset="12835494">--But when that happens, the knowledge that that can happen in the future is an insecurity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.426" offset="12865692">And today, when the largest corporations in the country are in danger of bankruptcy, when institutions who haven't gone bankrupt for 30 years are suddenly going bankrupt, it's a very immediate thought.</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.569" offset="12950224">The consequences of the rule contended by the Government are simply much broader than they submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.861" offset="12987423">I submit that if this Court, whatever it says, if it goes the other way, if it rules against us in this case and says that the privilege passes, it will pass for individuals too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.370" offset="13049490">It will have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.436" offset="13053774">The same statutes apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.155" offset="13060565">The same justifications by the Government apply, to get at fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.624" offset="13078538">They're the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.476" offset="13081881">Everything is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.926" offset="13087733">And the consequences are simply worse for individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.094" offset="13104347">But what happened in this case... and I think Your Honors should be aware of this... is precisely what will be discouraged in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.367" offset="13133499">In this case, it was the bankrupt's attorneys who suggested to it that they turn themselves in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.871" offset="13159517">And on a Saturday the attorneys... it was the attorneys who called, with the client's consent, called the CFTC and said: You better come in; there's problems here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.959" offset="13195775">You wouldn't have that, and you wouldn't have the disclosures to the attorneys, without the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.832" offset="13231302">What is at issue here is making the attorney a witness, nothing less.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.469" offset="13249901">It will change the role of attorneys from that of advisors and confidants and maybe internal investigators to that of an aid in the Government's war to prosecute, to prosecute fraud, to prosecute misfeasance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.163" offset="13316670">It's a fine goal, but the lawyers for private companies have a different mission to fulfil, and we ask this Court to affirm and to keep that mission precisely what it has been.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.659" offset="13390649">And I thought it belonged to the client, and that the attorney just exercises on behalf of the client, not to protect himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3327.034" offset="13440177">What this... what the Government would do would be to take that role and take that choice from the client and give it to the Government, and that's why we object.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.477" offset="13505901">What lawyers do... and I think I'm basically through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.547" offset="13522201">I should say, what lawyers do they do on behalf of their client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.315" offset="13533277">But they only do it if they're allowed to.</text>
