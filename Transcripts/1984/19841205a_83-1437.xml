            <label>Mr. Donald G. Peterson</label>
            <text syncTime="10.772" offset="177643">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the facts of this case are important to this Court for two reasons: One, to decide this case and; two, to evolve, to develop, to define the principles that should be applied in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.304" offset="275759">The facts of this case are that in October of 1979 a law suit was brought pleading a cause of action under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.564" offset="340751">Two years later, after the case had been pending in the Northern District of Illinois, the defendant, the petitioner here, made an offer to the complainant.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.691" offset="413267">The offer was a substantial offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.077" offset="426851">The offer was $100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.529" offset="440644">After the offer of $100,000 was made, pre-trial conferences were held, discovery was reopened, the case proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.420" offset="492262">That was November 5, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.323" offset="511801">In April of 1982 this case proceeded to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.679" offset="545238">The negotiations had proved unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.631" offset="565091">The attempt to resolve this case without a jury trial proved unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.885" offset="586093">A long, hard-fought, well-fought and fairly-fought struggle took place in that courtroom, with expert witnesses on police procedure, with expert witnesses on ballistics, with expert witnesses on criminal evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.680" offset="661222">When the jury went back to deliberate, they had about three weeks of proceedings that they had heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.237" offset="703540">The attorney representing the plaintiff at trial, representing the respondent here, was an outstanding and excellent and effective advocate of his client's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.414" offset="768219">He had not with his client agreed to accept the $100,000 that was offered him.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.539" offset="804686">For the defendant to offer that plaintiff $100,000 meant that that defendant's attorney had to persuade his clients and principals to come up with that money, because under Rule 68, when that offer is put on paper, when that offer is served, the plaintiffs... excuse me, the defendant, the petitioner here, is going to have to live with it, because the plaintiff may take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.824" offset="929865">And if the plaintiff takes it, there is a judgment entered and the defendant can do nothing but pay that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.514" offset="964555">The defendant, petitioner here, before making the offer had to evaluate the case, had to study the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure... I believe there's 86 of them; this is Rule 68... had to, under the state of the law as it existed at that time, make a judgment as to how to use 68 and how it might affect or be affected by 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.222" offset="1123380">If the defendant on that occasion, November 5, 1981, when he made that offer, if he did not offer attorney's fees to the plaintiff, if he did not indicate, as he did, that attorney's fees were included in the offer, I suggest that when... if the plaintiff had accepted the offer the plaintiff would have come back to the Court and asked the Court to assess attorney's fees stacked on top of that $100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.549" offset="1284712">In this case, the fees accrued or alleged to be accrued in the trial court amount to around $171,000 perhaps even $173,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.791" offset="1341659">Without making that offer as it was made, petitioners would have put $100,000 on the table, had it taken away from them, and exposed themselves to the potential of another $171,000 or $173,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.722" offset="1425460">The plain meaning of 1988 authorized, sanctions, and encourages what the defendant did.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.065" offset="1478750">What the defendant did in these circumstances was fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.600" offset="1500902">It was fair to the plaintiff; it was fair to the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="760.068" offset="3174828">The first step in the solution to that problem is that District Court is going to have to adjudicate that issue, and there is a body of law, obviously, upon which that is going to be measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.942" offset="3226342">The Court's discretion in awarding those fees, the District Court's discretion, is governed by a body of common law and it's developed in large part out of this Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerrold J. Ganzfried</label>
            <text syncTime="1395.040" offset="5714662">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is a very practical on, whether Rule 68 must be read in a way that rewards a lawyer even at the expense of his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.549" offset="5772758">Because of some mistaken notions of policy, the Court of Appeals held that an attorney's fee of $32,000, more than 50 percent of the damage award, was, as a matter of law, unacceptable, and that fees should be reconsidered and awarded for work that obviously produced no benefit to the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.547" offset="5860738">We submit that the decision below is in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.999" offset="5874531">It fails to honor the plain meaning of the language Congress employed in Section 1988, that costs include attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.688" offset="5905251">The decision also undercuts the purpose of Rule 68, as expressed in the Delta Air Lines case, that is, to encourage settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.876" offset="5938061">And, finally, the Court of Appeals incorrectly perceived a conflict between Rule 68 and Section 1988, a conflict between Rule 68 and in fact the intent of virtually all the Federal fee-shifting statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.470" offset="5996471">And we submit that there is nothing in the scores of Federal fee-shifting statutes that is incompatible with the objective of settling law suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.909" offset="6030221">Those laws were passed not simply to underwrite plaintiffs as an end in itself, but for the broader purpose of ensuring that lack of funds will not prevent an aggrieved party from vindicating his statutory or Constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.252" offset="6091556">And the vindication of the client's right is a goal that we submit can be achieved just as effectively and, in many instances, more effectively by settlement than it can be by continuing to litigate law suits through trial and appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.380" offset="6168043">Now by definition, in rule 68 cases, the client has achieved his greatest vindication when that offer of judgment is made, and at that point the attorney's fee provision has satisfied its objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.342" offset="6239932">It's served its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.192" offset="6247351">If a plaintiff turns down that vindication and continues to litigate, there is no policy reason to continue to subsidize his litigation and to continue to subsidize his lawyer from pursuing that litigation, litigation which, by definition, will result in a detriment to his client.</text>

            <text syncTime="1577.941" offset="6446299">But Judge Posner apparently thought that was important because of the limitations on what the rules can do; that's the reason I asked the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.560" offset="6464794">Well, I understand that, but I suggest that Judge Posner is incorrect on that, for two primary reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.897" offset="6490080">First, that he was relying on the Erie line of cases, the diversity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.701" offset="6513382">We don't have a Federal-state issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.522" offset="6528637">And, second, I suggest that this Court has rejected that substance-procedure test, and let me refer the Court to a case that is not cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.794" offset="6569702">It's the American Pipe and Construction Company case v. Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.496" offset="6584539">It's in 414 US, page 538, in which the Court specifically rejected the substance-procedure dichotomy and said that the test is whether, in that case it was the tolling of the statute of limitations, the test is whether by a court doing that in a given context it is acting in consonance with the legislative scheme in which the statute of limitations appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.516" offset="6696657">Now our reading of Rule 68 is consistent with the principles of providing attorney's fees that this Court has announced in Smith v. Robinson and Hensley v. Eckerhart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.204" offset="6731347">The Rule allows the Court easily to draw the distinction that is described in Smith v. Robinson, that is, the clear line between hours of work that contributed to a plaintiff's success and those that did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.845" offset="6785891">Rule 68 establishes a conclusive presumption that the hours spent after the offer was rejected did not in any way contribute to the plaintiff's success, and fees should not be awarded for such counter-productive efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.974" offset="6846391">We argue also that the Court of Appeals opinion would make settlements less likely by encouraging counsel to reject reasonable offers, secure in the knowledge that the meter will continue to run and that any recovery at trial, no matter how small, will pay for every tick of the meter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.500" offset="6916503">Now that result is directly contrary to what this Court has called the</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.970" offset="6934371">"national policy to minimize the cost of litigation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.606" offset="6949000">a policy that is strongly emphasized in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.176" offset="6971256">The Court said that in 1964 in Farmer v. Arabian-American Oil Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.247" offset="6991527">We submit that the reed to control litigation costs is even more pronounced now than it was in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.384" offset="7020053">Now let's recognize how the attorney's fee provisions operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.122" offset="7039070">They provide a powerful incentive for a defendant to settle because as a case drags on the defendant faces exposure to the damage award, he faces exposure to the plaintiff's attorney's fees and, of course, he has to bear the continuing cost of defending the law suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.433" offset="7108242">The defendants thus have strong pressures to settle, but obviously they can't do that alone, and that's where Rule 68 fits in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.337" offset="7139902">It provides a similar incentive to bring the plaintiffs to the bargaining table.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.057" offset="7158815">We submit also that the decision below is inconsistent with Congress' purpose of preventing windfalls for lawyers, a purpose this Court recognized in Blum v. Stenson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.699" offset="7205313">To that end, Congress authorized courts, in their discretion, to award reasonable fees adequate to attract competent counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.137" offset="7239063">Now one need only imagine the meeting at which counsel tells his client that it will cost him some $200,000 in fees to lose $8,000 in his judgment to conclude that the resulting fee is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.647" offset="7301130">And, as the Court noted in Hensley, the hours that are not profitably billed to one's client also are not properly billed to one's adversary, pursuant to the statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.205" offset="7347315">In short, our position is that the billing judgment principle that the Court described in Hensley is equally applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.143" offset="7379080">Counsel should be expected to exercise litigation judgment, settlement judgment, in a way that encourages settlements by eliminating the windfall that the Court of Appeals approved, and in our view, when read correctly, Rule 68 does precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.955" offset="7450342">I'd like to respond to one point that came up during petitioner's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.307" offset="7463821">The question of the validity of the offer in this case is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.628" offset="7485032">The parties stipulated that the pre-offer fees were $32,000, so while the initial offer did not have breakdown, as the parties stand before the Court that figure has been broken down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.702" offset="7537382">It's been broken down to $32,000 for costs, including attorney's fees, and $68,000 for damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.532" offset="7624631">The judge asked the parties to consult on the figure, and they agree that the pre-offer cost plus attorney's fees was $32,000, and that's where the figure comes from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.990" offset="7662456">So as the case reached the Seventh Circuit and as it comes to this Court, we have an offer that the parties, by stipulation, have broken down to $32,000 and the remainder for damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="2635.194" offset="10675315">And may I point out in this particular instance and in response to your question, Justice White, the logic of the position taken by the opposition to the effect that there is a linkage between Section 1988 and Rule 68, which would require the plaintiffs to forego post-offer fees accrued after the making of the offer, would not result in the transfer of defendant's fees to plaintiff in accordance with that particular incorporation either.</text>

            <text syncTime="3747.193" offset="15123341">The conjunction of those two words at the end of Section 1988 establishes no linkage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.597" offset="15148941">Indeed, the historical evidence is that there simply was not linkage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.983" offset="15166495">That cannot be manufactured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.868" offset="15174018">The many, many assertions in briefs to the effect that this was intended or it must be assumed or it is apparent are simply a tissue of wishful thinking.</text>

            <text syncTime="3769.706" offset="15213411">Well, Mr. Stone, I guess there's some indication that Congress wanted to treat fees as costs so that they could be shifted to recovery against cities and states and counties, so apparently they wanted to treat them as costs, at least for that purpose.</text>
