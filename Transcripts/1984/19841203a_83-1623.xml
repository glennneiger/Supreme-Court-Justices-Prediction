            <label>Mr. Jonathan Wallas</label>
            <text syncTime="96.304" offset="524096">This is fine, thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.985" offset="530784">Mr. Chief Justice, thank you; may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="101.309" offset="544158">The issue in this case is whether the court of appeals erred in its application of Rule 52(a) when it concluded that the district court's findings of fact, including the ultimate finding of sex discrimination, were without evidentiary support.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.069" offset="603195">The facts of this case can be briefly stated as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.410" offset="620540">In March 1975 the job of recreation director became vacant... became vacant in the city of Bessemer City.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.826" offset="650216">Eight applicants for the job were interviewed by a five-person committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.499" offset="668919">The committee consisted of four men and one woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.760" offset="685951">Prior to selection, no job duties, selection guidelines or criteria for selection, written or otherwise, were provided to or promulgated by the selection committee, except the requirement that the successful applicant live in Bessemer City or be willing to relocate there.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.766" offset="765990">Although no job description was provided to the selection committee, the committee unanimously agreed that the recreation director's job was to develop a diverse program of recreation activities for all ages and sexes in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.495" offset="824923">The unanimous first choice of the committee for the job was a man by the name of Burt Broadway, but Mr. Broadway was not willing to relocate to Bessemer City, and he was not formally offered the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.902" offset="874555">The committee found two other applicants well qualified for the position... Donald Kincaid and Phyllis Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.297" offset="900051">Kincaid was selected by a 4 to 1 vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.178" offset="911649">The four male members of the committee voted for Mr. Kincaid; the one female member of the committee voted for Ms. Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.762" offset="937980">At trial the parties presented conflicting evidence about a number of material facts, especially about the motivation of the selection committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.568" offset="981135">The district court, citing and following a law established by this Court in the McDonnell Douglas case and the Burdine case, a legal analysis that has not been challenged by the respondent and which was not criticized by the Fourth Circuit, found that the city's sole articulation that Kincaid was selected, because he had a college degree in physical education, was pretextual.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.476" offset="1080818">The district court specifically found that the male committee members voted for Mr. Kincaid because he was a male, and that but for discrimination based on sex, the plaintiff would have been selected for the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.216" offset="1139750">The City appealed, contending that the court's findings of fact were clearly erroneous under Rule 52(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="258.210" offset="1171724">The Fourth Circuit, largely adopting the City's analysis of the evidence, reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.624" offset="1193354">We contend that the district court correctly assumed and applied its responsibilities and finding of facts, including the issue of discriminatory motivation, as explicitly required by this Court's decisions in Swint and Aikens, and that the findings of the district court are supported by substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.627" offset="1277363">Conversely, we contend that the Fourth Circuit strayed from its proper role under Rule 52 as an appellate court and that it wore blinders which prevented it from discovering the ample evidence which in fact supports the district court's findings; it selectively cited only those portions of the record which supported the facts found by the Fourth Circuit on the de novo basis, even going so far in footnote 4 to its opinion to excise a portion of Mrs. Boone's testimony about the relative qualifications of Ms. Kincaid and Mr. Anderson, thereby misrepresenting the substance of Ms. Boone's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.493" offset="1432844">It adopted a working wife defense, contrary to reason and law, which was then utilized to rebut the substantial evidence of bias found by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.131" offset="1479447">I would now like to discuss the evidence of discrimination found by the district court, evidence of such quantity and quality and with such support in the record that we contend strongly calls for this Court to reverse the court of appeals with instructions to reinstate the district court's verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.732" offset="1609850">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.024" offset="1614970">The district court found discrimination based on six separate subsidiary findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.008" offset="1646944">First, the district court found that Mr. Nichols, one of the male committee members, made direct statements indicating his bias against selecting a woman for the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.905" offset="1690516">Mr. Nichols stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="389.548" offset="1697099">"It would have been real hard for a lady to do the job. "</text>
            <text syncTime="393.010" offset="1710891">"I wouldn't want my wife to have it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="395.642" offset="1721445">"I have three children at home, and I think my wife should be at home. "</text>
            <text syncTime="399.215" offset="1735760">The district court found that these statements provided direct evidence of Nichols' illegal motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.369" offset="1760420">Second, the district court found that committee member Butler actively solicited four men for the position, including the successful candidate, Mr. Kincaid, and Mr. Broadway.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.804" offset="1810157">He further testified that he knew 12... excuse me... knew two well-qualified women who he would have voted for for the position, but he had not actively solicited their applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.734" offset="1861879">Third, the district court found that the committee had manipulated the selection criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.810" offset="1890091">When it first emphasized experience when experiencing Mr. Broadway, who had no college degree, and then emphasized the particular degree that Mr. Kincaid had, a degree in physical education, when it selected him.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.708" offset="1945680">It thus ignored the petitioner's combination of education and experience, including her diverse work experience and previous work in recreation, as well as her leadership experience, her experience gained... that leadership experience was gained working with various civic groups, her job-related experience working with schoolchildren and her various other job positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.993" offset="2038885">Fourth, the district court found the petitioner and only petitioner was asked certain questions, which because they were only asked of a female candidate for the job, implied substantial doubt that a woman should have a job which required night work, and which implied a sexually stereotypical attitude that a woman ought to be home at night instead of working.</text>

            <text syncTime="518.170" offset="2211607">Good afternoon, Mr. Chief Justice; may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="523.626" offset="2233445">Prior to the lunch break I was discussing the fourth separate finding of discrimination found by the district court concerning certain questions that the district court found were asked only of the female applicants... of the female applicant for the recreation director job.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.455" offset="2292691">The plaintiff had in this case what the Aikens case acknowledges as rare: an eyewitness... that is, Ms. Boone... who testified about the interviews.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.173" offset="2339607">The district court found that petitioner and only petitioner was asked how my husband felt about me applying for the job; if she realized that there was night work involved; and if she realized that there would be travel involved in the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.663" offset="2397598">There was no evidence that anyone but Ms. Anderson was asked a question about her spouse's reaction to seeking the job, or about travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.897" offset="2430513">There was conflicting evidence about whether other applicants were asked about night work... a factual dispute which the district court resolved in Ms. Anderson's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.073" offset="2471159">And I might point out that the defendant admitted in the post-trial arguments... immediately after the trial there were arguments to the court by counsel... that whether these questions were asked of all of the candidates was a credibility issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.821" offset="2522150">And that appears at page 176A of the Joint Appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="613.172" offset="2591531">Your Honor, I think that that smack of Title VII... of a Title VII violation to ask that question only of women who applied for a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.990" offset="2630820">It... it would imply that the women had the sole responsibility for raising the children, that men don't also have some responsibility for that.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="634.798" offset="2678049">Well, you say it would smack of, but you wouldn't think... you didn't respond that it was unconstitutional to ask that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="641.042" offset="2703022">--Well, I'm not sure we have to reach constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.604" offset="2721308">We're talking about the Title VII statute, and I think that if, as here, a district court used that piece of evidence with as much other evidence as was used by this district court to make a finding with respect to motivation, as this district court did, that that would be certainly within the province of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.289" offset="2808034">In the Aikens decision... I believe it's the footnote 2... Justice Rehnquist, as I recall, discussed some type of evidence which apparently was forecast by the plaintiff in that case and said if the plaintiff were able to show this, and if the Court found these particular facts, which were not exactly the same as was shown in this case, but similar type evidence of discrimination, that that would... and the district court found motivation and found discrimination, that that would not be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.977" offset="2930810">And I think... I think this is just one of the... of the legs that... upon which the finding was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.184" offset="2955678">In addition, the district court found, fifth, that two committee members, Butler and Nichols, had solicited Kincaid to apply for the job, and they referred to the job as athletic director, thereby improperly emphasizing the traditional male athletic component of the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.793" offset="3026105">Sixth, the district court found that no credit was given to the plaintiff for the detailed recreational program she advanced or the fact that she possessed a recreation supervision certificate obtained as a result of her previous experience in recreation supervision... a certificate which Mr. Kincaid did not possess.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.817" offset="3110114">We contend this body of evidence, these six examples or six findings of the district court of disparate treatment, both direct and circumstantial evidence, was more than sufficient under such cases of this Court as the Arlington Heights case to permit the finding in favor of petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="770.147" offset="3219515">Do we simply sit in exactly the same capacity as did the Fourth Circuit to decide whether the district court's findings were totally erroneous, or do we defer at all to the conclusions of the Fourth Circuit in that respect?</text>

            <text syncTime="782.796" offset="3270088">I think the primary role of this Court would be to do basically what the court of appeals was to do: to look at the evidence found by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.281" offset="3311989">And if there is evidence to support that, then unless that evidence is clearly outweighed by other evidence of record, then you should reinstate the district court's verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.130" offset="3363398">I think in addition, as I pointed out, you should take a very close look at what we say were the de novo findings of the court of appeals and the justification of the court of appeals for their decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="835.259" offset="3479904">What, of course, I think this Court has been trying to do, and I'm sure will hopefully try to do in this case, is try to again send a message to the lower courts about the proper role of... of an appellate court under Rule 52 and the proper role of a district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="930.502" offset="3860874">Is the burden on petitioner in a case like this... not the petitioner but the plaintiff... in a case like this to show that he or she is better qualified or is it sufficient if in this case, for example, Anderson had proved when the burden reverted to her under McDonnell Douglas to show that she was equally well qualified?</text>

            <text syncTime="957.009" offset="3966931">Our opinion would be that under... as I... as I read your decision in the Burdine case, Your Honor, that... that if two candidates are equally qualified, that the employer can take either one, but it can't discriminate on the basis of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.141" offset="4031505">And the point of this case is that the only reason, the only articulation in Burdine terms that was advanced by the City was that Mr. Kincaid had a degree in P.E. They really didn't discuss the overall qualifications of the candidates, and that's why I was referring the Court to what the district court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.872" offset="4102349">What the district court did was look at the job duties, because... because the... the... you need to recall that the City had not established any criteria for the job prior to selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.969" offset="4146758">It looked at the job duties and then juxtaposed the qualifications of the two candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.461" offset="4164730">So to answer your question, I think that if discrimination is shown, and if the sole articulation advanced by the employer is rebutted and shown to be pretextual, then the plaintiff wins.</text>

            <text syncTime="1224.314" offset="5036175">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.518" offset="5065014">As Mr. Wallas has suggested, this case raises a straightforward question whether the court of appeals correctly applied the clearly erroneous standard of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.834" offset="5102212">Based on our examination of the court of appeals' opinion and the record in this case, we've concluded that the court of appeals erred in the application of that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.930" offset="5142650">There's no real dispute about what the proper standard is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.763" offset="5157905">Everyone agrees it's the clearly erroneous standard, and that's what the court of appeals purported to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.208" offset="5183714">But we think that in applying the standard, the court of appeals departed from this Court's mandate that a reviewing court is not to place itself in the position of the trial court and simply to duplicate the trial court's factfinding function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.238" offset="5243796">The United States finds itself at various times on both sides of Title VII cases, sometimes as a plaintiff and sometimes as a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.785" offset="5282039">It therefore has a general interest in the proper application of the clearly erroneous standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.669" offset="5305549">In this case there was conflicting testimony on a number of points, and that is almost always the case with Title VII cases that go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.005" offset="5346927">You have different participants in a personnel decision who have different perspectives on what may have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.780" offset="5373990">Here you have five selection committee members who testified, as well as two of the applicants who testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.174" offset="5399590">They had different recollections of what happened in the selection process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.099" offset="5419339">Some of the evidence that went into the record supported petitioner's view that the committee had discriminated against her, had decided that she shouldn't have the position of recreation director because that was an unsuitable job for a woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.487" offset="5472838">There was other evidence that was put in by respondent that seemed to go the other way, that seemed to suggest that the committee members thought Mr. Kincaid was more qualified than petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.973" offset="5510767">The trial clerk... the trial court heard all of that evidence, and it resolved the conflicts on the significant issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.885" offset="5762483">And as Mr. Wallas suggested, the district court did... did put the burden on the plaintiff and concluded that she had met it in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1432.864" offset="5870317">I think it's important to recognize that there are several steps in this issue of qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.366" offset="5892364">There is first the definition of what it was that the selection committee was looking for, what the city was looking for in a recreation director.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.768" offset="5957984">I mean if the selection committee isn't given any standards, can't the definition of qualification evolve while they're considering the position?</text>

            <text syncTime="1465.564" offset="6001138">If you don't have evidence, as you did not in this case, that there is a mandated list of qualifications ahead of time, you may well have that evolving, as I think the qualification of residence in Bessemer City probably evolved, as I read the record, during the selection process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.326" offset="6072191">But here I think the court looked at what the selection committee members said in the course of the trial about what they were looking for, so it had some evidence on just what it was that had evolved during the selection process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.146" offset="6131437">And the... the court took the selection committee members at their word, and some of them said we were looking for the all-around qualifications of someone who could provide a full range of programs, not only athletics, but art, music, dance and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.816" offset="6190160">Our review of the record in this case indicates that there was substantial evidence to support the findings of the district court, and that the entire record... and we agree with respondent that the court of appeals ought to look at the entire record... shows that the contrary evidence does not clearly outweigh the evidence in support of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.568" offset="6277200">In these circumstances we think the court of appeals should not have concluded that the trial court findings were clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.124" offset="6307398">We think the trial... we think the court of appeals went wrong in this case because it failed to give the proper regard to the trial court's factfinding function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.471" offset="6344805">Instead of asking how the trial court's findings measure against the evidence in the record, the court of appeals appears to have taken a fresh look at the record and to have put itself in the position of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.058" offset="6399140">I would like to refer just for a moment to digress on few points that we think may create some confusion and that the Court might want to address in deciding this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.015" offset="6442921">One of them was raised by Justice Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.927" offset="6454624">We agree with petitioner that there is some confusion in the court's... the court of appeals' flat statement that petitioner had the burden of showing that she was better qualified than Mr. Kincaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.676" offset="6497569">Now, the trial court did find that she was better qualified based on what it understood the qualifications to be based on the testimony; so I'm not sure it affects the bottom line in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.483" offset="6540828">But the statement seems to suggest that even when the plaintiff has... has shown affirmatively that an employer acted for a discriminatory motive that she somehow can't prevail if she was only equally qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.550" offset="6597043">That seems counter to what the Court said in Burdine, and it also seems counter to the Court's explanation in the Aikens case that you look at all types of evidence; you look at the full range of evidence on discriminatory motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.479" offset="6652841">Here you had not only the evidence on qualifications, but you had some other evidence about what was in the minds of the committee members and the way they went about their selection process that was also relevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1674.220" offset="6835803">You may have to sort more out and... and put the burden on the employer at that point to show that he would have hired the other person in any event.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.559" offset="6893167">As I noted earlier, here the trial court found that the qualifications... that that was a pretextual point on the part of the employer, and that the only motive you had was discrimination in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1718.709" offset="7013749">We've suggested in our brief we think that common sense indicates that is simply not relevant evidence in most contexts in most Title VII cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1919.030" offset="7814976">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.202" offset="7827724">The respondent's position in this matter is that the only proper issue to which at least to some extent is agreed by the petitioner is whether the Fourth Circuit properly conducted its review of the critical subsidiary and ultimate finding of discrimination under the clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.857" offset="7914346">Where we very clearly part company and believe that we have the weight of... the authority of this great Court over the last 40 years in stare decisis in decision after decision is where we disagree with the petitioner's position... and it's on page 4 of their reply brief... where they say that a court of appeals cannot reverse... and that's clearly erroneous... a district court opinion which is supported by evidence which by itself may appear to be substantial or even by substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.508" offset="8052900">We have, of course, the seminal decision of U.S. Gypsum of this Court in 1948 that says that the not only opportunity but duty of the reviewing court on factual matters is to review the entire evidence and to reverse if it determines that a mistake has occurred, and that it has concluded that such a mistake has occurred in how the facts have been viewed by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.131" offset="8183407">That 1948 decision, which has been cited in so many subsequent decisions by this Court, was cited specifically and applied both in determining the subsidiary effects to be judged in a clearly erroneous basis by the district court, and the ultimate fact of intentional bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.223" offset="8263760">The U.S. Gypsum court was cited relative to each of these in a seriatim fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.797" offset="8286121">First the court looked at the issue of disparate selection criteria... that is, whether everyone was asked about the night work inquiry... applied Rule 52, applied U.S. Gypsum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.525" offset="8337007">It did the similar thing on the qualifications issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.446" offset="8348710">And then after reviewing the evidence as a whole, in stating that it did, it said absent record evidence to support those two subsidiary findings of bias, the rest of the record, particularly relative to the plaintiff's continued burden of proof in Title VII cases, is simply insufficient to establish bias; that is, insufficient to carry the plaintiff's Burdine burden of proof...

            <text syncTime="2405.073" offset="9759218">The court, in a sense, has an opportunity to try to appeal brief its case, as it did here, by incorporating changes into the final opinion that say now that I've seen the comments made by the defendant's counsel, I admit that the question was asked, but I will discount it as a credibility determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.984" offset="9838839">I now say in my final opinion, having had all this work product from three different sources to look at, that the question was asked, but was only asked facetiously and out of frustration, which is, I would say, number one, a distortion of the proper view of the trial court in deciding what is a credibility determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2750.418" offset="11140573">The common practice in federal courts was to do exactly that, and frequently there was a great engagement over the findings, and the losing party, thinking in terms of appeal and Rule 52, would come in and they'd have even on rare occasions supplemental arguments on a particular finding, which compelled the judge to really go back to the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2784.009" offset="11274947">It has been pointed out by this Court in the Inwood case and in the Swint case that although a review of the entire evidence to determine whether factual conclusions... excuse me... factual findings by the district courts are erroneous, clearly erroneous or not, that that is justified, but that a de novo review of the record is not justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.709" offset="11389781">Thus, the question becomes what is the distinction between a Rule 52 Gypsum sort of review of the entire evidence as opposed to a de novo review, since one is not only permitted but mandated, and the other one is clearly precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.068" offset="11455192">We would point out for the consideration of the Court that the distinction is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.822" offset="11478180">Number one, and as this Court pointed out in Justice White's opinion in the Swint case, an opinion drafted free of the strictures of Rule 52(a), equals an opinion which is undertaken de novo review; and number two, and more specifically, that reversing a trial court without holding that the trial court's findings were clearly erroneous by review of the entire record constitutes a de novo review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.729" offset="11593850">In that regard we would argue to this Court that the review by the Fourth Circuit in this case stated the applicable legal standard, Rule 52, and the Gypsum case, and at least sub silenio applied Gypsum's progeny in reaching by review of an entire record the appropriate conclusion and perhaps inescapable conclusion, given the plaintiff's burden of proof, that clear error had abounded in the district court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.822" offset="11722163">That is our position as to why de novo review, which is one of the concerns of the Government in this action, was not what occurred in this case and is why this case is clearly distinguishable from the Swint case in that regard where the--</text>

            <text syncTime="3017.210" offset="12207727">The point I would also make is that the corollary of Rule 52 to the general deference given to the factfinding responsibility and function of the trial court is also contained in Rule 52 where the rule states specifically that factfinding will be accomplished by the court specially... not by the parties, but by the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3359.085" offset="13575185">In fact, our position is that the strictures of Rule 52 are well set out, that the Fourth Circuit does have clearly the authority under Gypsum and its... the cases following Gypsum to review the entire record to determine if there was clear error, even if there are credibility issues involved, and that there really is no legal issue in this case at this time, nonetheless any one of momentous proportions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.323" offset="13692214">We think the stare decisis clearly dictates the way that this case would go, and that that is that the Fourth Circuit acted... knew what it's authority was under the Swint case, under the Gypsum case, and that it applied that authority correctly in reviewing the entire evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.224" offset="13759819">On the issue of credibility, which has been broached by the petitioner in this case, we have several observations to make in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.146" offset="13831499">Number one, we do not believe that it's actual justiciable issue in this case, because the only references to credibility in this action in the record below... and I must get back to the genesis of the opinion to address that... are general findings in the final opinion of the Court adopted from the plaintiff's counsel's draft, expanded draft of the memorandum decision, prefatory language in the first Part that says after viewing the witnesses and making the necessary credibility determinations, I make the following findings of fact and conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.602" offset="13981337">That's the only place credibility really comes out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.184" offset="13991682">It was not in in the initial decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.206" offset="14003698">Number two, we reiterate that even if there are genuine germane credibility issues here, that the Fourth Circuit, under the clearly erroneous standard, still has authority to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.522" offset="14056988">And in this regard, we disagree quite directly with the opinion of the amicus ACLU, and to the extent that that opinion is expressed by the brief of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.871" offset="14106411">The credibility issue was not related to any specific factfindings in the district court other than this matter I addressed earlier: that the successful applicant initially, it was determined by the district court, was not asked a question which the court later said he was asked but only facetiously after our side, the defendants, had commented on the case to the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3549.469" offset="14336811">Because it was right there in the record that the plaintiff's own witness on the selection committee had, as she said herself and volunteered the testimony, and I asked him myself what will your new wife think about you working at night; that it was a historical fact from the record, but it was only susceptible of that interpretation because of what she'd said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.062" offset="14415179">It's analogous to a point Justice Rehnquist made last spring in the arguments in the Bose case and which it is why it is so necessary that the collective wisdom of the appellate process be applied to... under the strictures of Rule 52 to be able to determine whether the credibility determinations or any sorts of fact determinations will stand the light of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.239" offset="14511832">As Justice Rehnquist pointed out... and I gather from the transcript he looked at the clock when he said so that day... he said if a witness says at the district court level it is not now ten minutes till 2:00 and the judge agrees, if that is not historical fact, there must be a way to review it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.559" offset="14581109">And that's what our position here is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.660" offset="14589572">Now, in very recent cases this Court in a number of decisions has reached results which very clearly implicate increased civil rights, job rights for individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.150" offset="14647460">I would point out, for example, the Hishon v. King and Spaulding case, the Cooper v. Federal Reserve case, the U.S. Jaycees case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.685" offset="14681628">If the right and responsibility, the duty, as this Court has put it, to review factual determinations is minimized by some decision that comes out of this Court, there will be no clear message or clear result of increased civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.316" offset="14752158">Take, for example, the situation of a judge skeptical of Title VII at the district court level, particularly in an era when the selection of the federal district judges has become a matter of such highly politicized magnitude that one of the political parties is saying unless you pass a litmus test on a particular issue, which this Court has addressed, you shouldn't be qualified as a district court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.046" offset="14863127">That's... that's a position of a political party now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.765" offset="14869918">Say that we end up with someone who's skeptical of Title VII on a district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.199" offset="14887682">He is... he or she would be just as unfettered in casting the talismanic characterization of credibility on a factfinding which is not supported by the record with which he happened to agree as a political matter, he or she, as a political matter, and insulate the opinion from review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.374" offset="14972423">This case would not be a blessing for the civil rights community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.195" offset="14987678">It would be a mixed blessing at best; a parochial result at worst.</text>

            <text syncTime="3724.252" offset="15035953">I would like to comment very, obviously, briefly on the method in which the findings of fact were prepared, and I would refer the Court to footnote 6 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.859" offset="15074300">Whatever ought to be the rule, in this case Judge McMillan prepared his own findings of fact at the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.524" offset="15100945">He added numerous transcript references.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.297" offset="15116096">There are substantial differences between what the plaintiff initially prepared and what he prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.320" offset="15136158">And it was simply not the work product of what... of what we presented; it was the judge's work product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.685" offset="15161654">It was several months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.304" offset="15168132">And we urge you to look and compare those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.956" offset="15178686">The Government has done that, and in its footnote 6 it points out the various distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.202" offset="15199688">So whatever the rule is... and I agree that this judge made his decision right after trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.693" offset="15217660">And it would be totally unfair to penalize the plaintiff because... in whom the judge had ruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.347" offset="15248276">I mean she... he ruled in Ms. Anderson's favor two days... two or three days after the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.559" offset="15261128">And yet... and yet, now, because of some procedural thing, they ruled against us.</text>
