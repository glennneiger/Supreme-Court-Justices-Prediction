            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="118313">Mr. Landry, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_j_landry" startTime="68.144" stopTime="216.824">
            <label>Mr. Robert J. Landry</label>
            <text syncTime="68.144" offset="390822">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the instant case presents the opportunity for this Court to address and decide for the first time the standard of review which should be made by Federal habeas corpus concerning Witherspoon claims brought by state prisoners in habeas corpus actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.474" offset="480161">The decision of the lower court, we believe, is erroneous and must be reversed because it is not mandated by, in our belief, to be consistent with prior Supreme Court decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.716" offset="525092">It fails to accord the appropriate deference to state court determinations of fact, as required by 2254 D.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.387" offset="555812">It fails to accord the respect to the federal district court fact-finding obligations of district judges under rule 52, and announces a mechanistic policy which is more conducive to adherence to form rather than substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.879" offset="609729">We would ask the Court to provide much-needed clarification to the lower courts in this regard by reiterating that the position of Witherspoon and his progeny is that a prospective juror may be excused for cause when his capital punishment views are such that he is unable or unwilling to follow along in the court's instruction; that there is no necessary formula to be employed either by the questioner or by the answer given by the prospective juror; that a juror is required to assure the trial judge that he can follow the law or else he will be excused for cause based on his views; and that because of the unique advantage occupied by the trial judge in making the determinations as to what the jury is saying and means, that wide latitude should be given his determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.366" offset="827694">Very briefly, the facts in this case which brought this to a head, Johnny Paul Witt was tried and convicted of the first degree murder of Jonathan Kushner and received a sentence of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.340" offset="875655">During the voir dire examination of one of the jurors, Juror Colby, the prosecutor inquired as to whether or not the juror had any particular personal beliefs against capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.314" offset="923511">The juror responded that she had some personal views and the prosecutor followed that up with a series of questions:</text>
            <text syncTime="209.651" offset="956844">First: Would that interfere with you sitting as a juror in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="214.289" offset="975443">I'm afraid it would.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="228.632" offset="1032808">I think it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.398" offset="1039809">At this point the prosecutor moved to excuse the juror for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.369" offset="1059766">The defendant neither objected to the removal nor asked to give any additional clarifying or rehabilitative questions of the juror, and the trial court granted the prosecutor's motion to step down.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.760" offset="1113265">We believe that the appropriate test for habeas corpus in reviewing collateral attacks, Witherspoon claims, is the presumption of correctness outlined in 2254 D of section Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.638" offset="1176795">The policy reasons for this include the traditional values of comedy and federalism which have been enunciated in previous proceedings in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.411" offset="1219949">Going back to Stone v. Powell, this Court has announced that state judges are fully capable of applying constitutional standards, and they take the same oath to uphold the Constitution as do the federal judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.337" offset="1271567">It would emphasize the importance of the trial as a main event in a scheme of the criminal justice system and not just a preliminary round or a trial run for a never-ending cycle of appeals and post-conviction motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.863" offset="1337709">It would develop the concept of finality for litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.831" offset="1353591">Instead of having successive repetitive review to achieve some never-ending idea that a better result will be achieved, the courts will recognize that successive review merely affords an opportunity for different results.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.276" offset="1423391">And, finally, it would be consistent with the prior decisions of this Court which have most recently recognized the importance that should be given to trial judges in making their determinations on matters of fact which they are better equipped to resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.119" offset="1486711">Most of these values which I've just enunciated, of course, are most adequately and demonstrated most forcefully in this Court in the recent opinion of Patton v. Young which was decided two or three months ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.414" offset="1559959">In that case the Court was called upon to decide whether or not the trial judge's determination or a federal court's determination as to whether a juror was biased because of pretrial prejudicial publicity, and there had been a disagreement among the state court and the federal courts about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.761" offset="1641356">And this Court ruled that because of the greater opportunity of a trial judge to observe the demeanor and credibility of a juror in responding to leading questions, listening to the tone of the responses given, that greater deference should be given to the trial judge's determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="475.103" offset="2018669">It's more or less similar to the situation, we think, in Novelli v. Dellarose in which the trial judge was called upon to make a determination as to the voluntariness of the confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="703.634" offset="2932746">Mr. Landry, let me read you a more recent formulation of the Witherspoon past remark the case of Adams v. Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.157" offset="2970884">Where the court said this line of cases has established that a juror may not be challenged for cause based on his views about capital punishment unless those views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.968" offset="3042146">I take it your submission is that the trial judge's ruling at the close of the colloquy certainly satisfied that standard.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert J. Landry</label>
            <text syncTime="739.974" offset="3078195">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.507" offset="3080285">To the extent that the lower court believed that there had to be a total conformity to the language of Footnote 21 in Witherspoon, he was mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.496" offset="3112259">The restatement in Adams certainly indicates that if a juror's views are such that would prevent or substantially impair his performance, he may be excused for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.102" offset="3150711">And, of course, the juror's response in this case did meet that criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.387" offset="3163773">The error, we believe, of the Eleventh Circuit is an emphasis on requiring that there be an exact compliance with Footnote 21 terminology.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.884" offset="3245797">Now, the Eleventh Circuit apparently has held that "interfere with", used by the prosecutor or by trial judge, is an impermissibly ambiguous statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.590" offset="3280592">We do not understand it to be so, and it is really quite unclear as to when that phrase became ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.196" offset="3319044">For example, at Footnote 5 of Witherspoon, this Court appears to have implied that the phrase,</text>
            <text syncTime="808.118" offset="3350705">"interfere with the ability to determine guilt in accordance with the law and evidence. "</text>
            <text syncTime="812.320" offset="3367528">was interchangeable and synonymous with the phrase used in the text,</text>
            <text syncTime="815.872" offset="3381738">"prevent from making an impartial decision as to guilt. "</text>
            <text syncTime="819.074" offset="3394591">Now, if the Court in writing the Witherspoon opinion in Footnote 5 apparently thought or at least implied that the two phrases might be interchangeable, certainly the prosecutor and the trial judge cannot be criticized for similarly regarding the two phrases as the equivalent of each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.238" offset="3475257">In any event, it is clear from the record that there was no complaint by Mr. Witt attacking the alleged ambiguity of the question until some eight years after his trial and some two changes in lawyers after he had gone through his direct appeal, attacking only the response given by the juror, and similarly attacking that response in the Federal District Court, Judge Carr.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.673" offset="3592912">So, consequently, we submit that the lower court has erred in requiring a strict verbatim compliance with the requirements of Footnote 21, and that contention that the Eleventh Circuit's ruling is inconsistent with the subsequently decided case of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.788" offset="3685386">In Lockett v. Ohio, for example, this Court did not require a strict reading of Footnote 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.878" offset="3717777">There, the jurors were asked whether or not they could take an oath to well and truly try the case, despite their views on capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.667" offset="3756961">And negative answers to that question led to their excusal.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.388" offset="3775769">So we submit that it is not really the form of the question or the answer that is significant, but simply the total context of what the response given is as to whether a juror is able and willing to conform with the law or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.765" offset="3845360">We think the Eleventh Circuit has erred in its determinations, and that this case is exactly the same as Adams v. Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.657" offset="3896873">We submit that this case is clearly distinguishable from Adams.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.025" offset="3914323">Adams was a case involving the requirement under Texas law that someone take an oath that he would not be affected at all in his determinations of any question of fact based on his views of capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.653" offset="3988824">He was not asked or gave no... it did not matter whether or not he could follow the law; it did not matter that he could set aside whatever his views were.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.211" offset="4027067">If they had any kind of effect at all on his fact-finding deliberations by his capital punishment views, he was excused and apparently could not even be rehabilitated.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.067" offset="4066564">So the State of Florida does not ask or require anyone not to be affected by capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.238" offset="4095195">We simply insist that a juror be willing to assure the trial judge that he can follow the law and follow the instruction of the court and follow the law on the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.313" offset="4147544">If he is not willing to give that assurance, then we submit that he is properly excused for cause under Lockett v. Adams.</text>

            <text syncTime="1435.272" offset="5859400">The Florida court adopted that rule in Williams, and I would note that the State, on direct appeal to the Florida Supreme Court, argued both Williams and Mathis to that court.</text>
