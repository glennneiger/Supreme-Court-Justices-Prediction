            <text syncTime="218.173" offset="995730">In effect, it establishes a rule that when you have both a state claim and an exclusively federal claim, the federal claim must be brought in the first instance in federal court, and then under pendant jurisdiction the state claims must be appended to it or else under claim preclusion arising out of the federal proceeding they will be lost and could not be brought in a state proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.045" offset="1115267">So, the net effect of this is that any time you have both a state claim and an arguably colorable exclusively federal claim, the state claim can never from a practical effect be determined in state court.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.955" offset="1282868">Well, not only our antitrust act, Your Honor, but the decision, we believe, also is unworkable because it assumes that when you bring... when you file your first suit, you know what you have, and that simply is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.398" offset="1348697">If I can use an example derived from the Fifth Circuit's decision in Hayes versus Solomon, the lessor, when he files his state court proceeding, may realize that he has a breach of lease case, but it is not until discovery and investigation that he may realize that the breach of lease is part of a broader scheme that also gives rise to a federal antitrust claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.716" offset="1453918">Now, under the Seventh Circuit's decision, arguably the federal claim is then barred because you started the state proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.673" offset="1497804">If it proceeds to judgment, it will then bar the subsequent federal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.327" offset="1516403">What happens here is that, in the example that I have just illustrated, plus we have found often from our own experience that what starts out as a consumer fraud case, for example, may turn into a securities case, or an antitrust case, or civil RICO case, and what happens is, the state's claim, the state suit is properly brought in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.995" offset="1631028">Now, normally when there is discovery and additional investigation, and additional facts show there will be another claim, you simply amend your state court suit, but when what you discover is an exclusively federal claim you cannot amend your state court suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.974" offset="1706992">Now, Justice Flamm's solution to this impasse is to file two suits, a state court suit, the state claim in state court, the federal court claim in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.632" offset="1761640">But what then happens is, you have two suits proceeding simultaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.770" offset="1782120">You will have duplicative discovery, duplicative motion practice, and obviously one suit will go to judgment first.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.958" offset="1822872">Then, if these do involve the same transaction, the first judgment will undoubtedly have some preclusive effect on the second suit, and that means that any of the proceedings, or at least some of the proceedings in the second suit are redundant.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.972" offset="1898940">Now, this certainly is not judicial economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.074" offset="1911374">Now, finally, or really, the state believes that issue preclusion will take care of most of the concerns that the Seventh Circuit raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.500" offset="1965082">To take the parade of horribles example in Derish versus San Mateo, if you had a state antitrust statute that was identical to the federal antitrust statute and the state court suit first went to judgment and there was a trial, the second suit will be barred not on claim preclusion but on issue preclusion because a necessary fact for the federal suit will have been determined in the state suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.853" offset="2086499">Finally, Your Honors, the Seventh Circuit decision is legally unsupportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.376" offset="2124638">This Court last term in Migra held that a federal court must look to state law to determine the preclusive effect of a state court judgment, and Illinois law is absolutely clear that the first court must have jurisdiction to determine the claim sought to be barred in the second suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.609" offset="2229546">There are two Illinois decisions that establish that principle, neither one of which is cited in any of the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.982" offset="2262983">These cases are Barton versus Southwick, 258 Illinois 515, and Phelps versus City of Chicago, 331 Illinois 80.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.439" offset="2312824">Phelps is directly on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.141" offset="2327662">It involved a first action, an ejectment in which the City of Chicago did not assert the validity of certain tax deeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.299" offset="2368308">While the suit was pending, a statute was amended which would have permitted such a claim to be brought in the ejectment proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.055" offset="2411254">Later, the city in a partition proceeding sought to raise assert the validity of the tax deeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.161" offset="2443750">The Illinois Supreme Court held that had the first suit gone to judgment before the statute was amended, the first suit would not have been res judicata with respect to the validity of the tax deeds because that claim could not have been raised in the first suit, but since the first suit went to judgment after the statute was amended, the validity of the tax deeds could have been asserted, and therefore the city was estopped, precluded... issue preclusion... from raising that.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.238" offset="2604037">Thus Illinois clearly requires that the first court must have jurisdiction over the second claim in order for the second claim to be barred by issue preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.378" offset="2656596">Accordingly, the state would ask this Court to reverse the decision of the Seventh Circuit.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael T. Sawyier</label>
            <text syncTime="688.160" offset="2875711">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents the basic question whether the plurality opinion of the Seventh Circuit was correct in making what Justice Potter Stewart referred to as a completely unprecedented expansion of the res judicata doctrine for extremely dubious reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.638" offset="2953660">After two successively vacated panel decisions, both dissented to by Justice Stewart, a five-to-four majority of the Seventh Circuit held that the present exclusively federal antitrust action is precluded by claim preclusion as the result of the Illinois court's dismissal of the petitioners' two previous Illinois court actions against the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.022" offset="3051149">However, because of the exclusive federal jurisdiction over federal antitrust actions, this action could not possibly have been brought in the Illinois courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.496" offset="3097020">The actions that the petitioner did bring there were state common law actions, and had nothing to do with antitrust law, and those actions were dismissed at the outset for failure to allege a claim under that completely different body of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.189" offset="3163789">In 1976 and 1977, when those state court actions were filed, no practicing lawyer would have imagined that their outcome might preclude by claim preclusion any subsequent exclusively federal claim, yet that is the radical and unjust result of the Seventh Circuit's claim preclusion decision as here imposed upon the petitioners, thus in effect denying them any day in court with respect to their present exclusively federal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.679" offset="3297849">At no point during the course of this action has the respondent dared to attempt to defend the merits of the exclusionary actions that it took toward the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.754" offset="3350094">Instead, it is argued to the District Court that the petitioners do not need to see their application files, because the information contained in them, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="818.378" offset="3396592">"would not substantially add to or detract from their general understanding of the facts. "</text>
            <text syncTime="824.948" offset="3422924">The petitioners' general understanding of the facts, Your Honors, is set forth at Pages 4 to 5 of their principal brief to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.173" offset="3463779">They have alleged that Dr. Treister was excluded from the respondent as a result of a conspiracy by the respondent's members to limit the output of expert testimony for plaintiffs in medical malpractice actions against orthopaedic surgeons in the Chicago area.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.385" offset="3536609">They have alleged that Dr. Marrese was likewise excluded for inherently illegal anticompetitive reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.055" offset="3567329">They have further alleged that the respondent's entire nationwide admission system is procedurally arbitrary and unfair, so unfair that the respondent in fact purports to prohibit any rejected applicant from questioning in any manner an adverse admission decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.202" offset="3647890">The petitioners have never received a hearing on these claims, and unless this Court reverses the Seventh Circuit's radical claim preclusion decision, they never will receive such a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.462" offset="3700971">The states of the Seventh Circuit have ably demonstrated the strong policy objections to compelling plaintiffs with both state law and exclusively federal claims to bring their state law claims in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.804" offset="3762307">Indeed, the spectacle of state governments having to litigate their state law claim in federal court is so objectionable that it by itself discredits the Seventh Circuit's approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.314" offset="3816328">But the petitioners would emphasize in addition the following three decisive points, any one of which is sufficient to require the reversal of the Seventh Circuit's claim preclusion decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.205" offset="3863871">First, there is an overriding federal rule of the nonpreclusion of exclusively federal claims by claim preclusion as the result of previous judgments when the previous tribunals lacked subject matter jurisdiction over such claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.398" offset="3932625">Second, as the states of the Seventh Circuit have demonstrated to this Court, Illinois' claim preclusion rules have always recognized and applied this same fundamental could have been raised principle, which is the fundamental fairness limitation of the claim preclusion doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.747" offset="4018098">Third, even if the Fourth Circuit's adoption of the identity analysis in Nash were correct, so that a state antitrust claim could ever conceivably substitute for an exclusively federal antitrust claim, this case is not that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.291" offset="4092285">The Illinois antitrust actions that were the only antitrust actions which petitioners could previously have brought in the Illinois courts simply are not the same as the present exclusively federal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.349" offset="4144530">There are two principal lines of authority for the overriding federal rule of nonpreclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.769" offset="4178176">First, the long-established prior jurisdictional competency requirement of federal claim preclusion as embodied in the could have been raised limitation of that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.595" offset="4233451">Second, the independent federal interest in what Judge Learned Hand referred to as the untrammeled jurisdiction of the federal courts over the various grants of exclusively federal jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1062.186" offset="4371796">Your Honor, the petitioners do not take a position on that issue except to point out that in the case of the previous state court actions that are here concerned, there were no determinations of fact, there were no determinations of law except for a determination that a technical pleading requirement of Illinois common law that has nothing to do with the antitrust laws was not satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.801" offset="4470329">In fact, the petitioners have argued that the fact that there were no determinations in the Illinois court is itself an argument for the particular unfairness of the preclusion here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1127.711" offset="4633960">But as for the question of issue preclusion as to issues of fact, the petitioners believe that issue preclusion of that sort may be consistent with the regime of exclusively federal grants of jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1681.001" offset="6847054">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, during the four years that this case has been pending in the District Court and the Court of Appeals, this Court has issued a series of opinions dealing with the application of the full faith and credit statute, Section 1738, to res judicata cases where a prior state court judgment is being asserted as a bar in a later federal court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.319" offset="6956351">This case adds an additional element.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.770" offset="6974114">That element is the fact that in this instance, the claim being asserted in the later federal court suit is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.530" offset="7029180">It is an antitrust claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.580" offset="7033360">It is the respondent's contention that the addition of this new element does not alter the standards for applying 1738 in these types of cases that have been announced by this Court recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.027" offset="7107234">We further submit that when the nature and the purposes of the policies of both finality of judgments, full faith and credit, and exclusive jurisdiction are examined and compared, they do not affect the principles of finality of judgment which these recent cases have announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.190" offset="7191871">In Allen, this Court said that Congress specifically required federal courts to give preclusive effect to state court judgments when the courts of the rendering states would do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.950" offset="7258849">In other words, the federal courts are to give the same preclusive effect to a state judgment that the state would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.806" offset="7294271">In Thomas versus Washington Gas, the Court noted that this means that it is the state that determines the extraterritorial effect of its judgments, but out of practical necessity, it must do so indirectly by prescribing the effect of those judgments within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.056" offset="7407329">In this instance, then, the court, the federal court must determine whether Illinois, in view of the final judgments which it has rendered, would preclude further litigation between these parties as a result of the denial of the membership application.</text>

            <text syncTime="1884.816" offset="7662388">It has been represented here that Illinois has a jurisdictional competency requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.803" offset="7686316">That representation, we submit, is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.755" offset="7706065">And it is the result of taking words out of the Illinois definition of res judicata and other words out of the language describing the difference between claim preclusion and issue preclusion and twisting them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.383" offset="7772625">The first language that is used is the Illinois requirement that the final judgment be by a court of competent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.922" offset="7810764">It is referring to the first court's jurisdiction to hear the first action, and the reason for that requirement is simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.195" offset="7843887">If the first court didn't have jurisdiction, that judgment is null and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.932" offset="7862800">A null and void judgment can be collaterally attacked, and collateral attack, preventing collateral attack is what res judicata is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.354" offset="7900520">Now, on the other hand, as the Court knows, there are two branches of preclusion, claim and issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.508" offset="7925076">And they are distinguished by most courts by saying that claim preclusion precludes not only what was litigated, but what could have litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.749" offset="7978052">What they are talking about there is not, we submit, subject matter jurisdiction, because most res judicata cases and the cases in which that language was generated are two cases filed in the same court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.378" offset="8040641">The jurisdictions were the same, but what they are saying is just what happened in the Phelps case that Mr. Murdock cited to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.097" offset="8071466">If the second claim hadn't matured, or if you had a continuing tort and the second claim involved actions which took place after the first suit, that is something that could not have been raised in the first suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.993" offset="8139071">In the Phelps case, they were talking hypothetically, saying that if the case had been tried before this statute that was relied on in the second case was enacted then that matter couldn't have been raised in that first case because the statute wasn't in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.187" offset="8207825">In other words, that cause of action was premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.389" offset="8216602">A fact necessary for it wasn't in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.358" offset="8232485">So, there is no jurisdictional competency requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.662" offset="8253696">What they are doing is saying there is a jurisdictional competency requirement, and furthermore we are going to measure it not from when the cause of action accrues and when the party makes a decision as to whether he is going to sue, where he is going to sue, what he is going to sue for, but you measure it after he has made that choice, after he, as Mr. Justice Potter Stewart said, has made the choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.778" offset="8350245">It isn't the court that made the choice here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.294" offset="8356305">It is the plaintiffs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2618.408" offset="10596671">Well, again, that is their choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.927" offset="10602836">If they, on the other hand, are made a defendant in a federal action, and they are worried about preclusion then of their state action that they would be bringing in the state as plaintiff, there you have party reversal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2711.436" offset="10968863">The problem here, of course, is that the petitioners waited until they had a final judgment in the state court, and then they brought a successive suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2721.208" offset="11007943">And as the Court noted in Migra, if a party files a state action and a federal action, he can preserve the federal action if the state action is decided first by indicating that he is reserving his right to proceed or his federal claim in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.170" offset="11083802">So, I think the options here are not just filing in the federal court and invoking pendent jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2869.489" offset="11601027">The petitioners believe that the true unfairness is the fact that they never had any opportunity, much less a full and fair opportunity to litigate the exclusively federal claim in the state court forum, and yet the Seventh Circuit has held in its claim preclusion decision that the exclusively federal claim is barred by the technical pleading requirements of Illinois common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.289" offset="11704263">The petitioners would return, Your Honors, to the fundamental concept of a full and fair opportunity to litigate that this Court emphasized in Kremer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.180" offset="11751805">Kremer, of course, laid down the general principle or followed the Allen case in extending the general principle of the full faith and credit requirement of Section 1738.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.404" offset="11800707">But in Kremer this Court recognized that if the parties had not had a full and fair opportunity to litigate an issue in state court in the previous forum, then there would be no issue preclusion, notwithstanding the ordinary effect of Section 1738, and notwithstanding in particular what the state's preclusion rule said on that subject.</text>
