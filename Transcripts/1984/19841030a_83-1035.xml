            <label>Mr. Henry I. Klein</label>
            <text syncTime="10.439" offset="181899">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there are two issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.443" offset="209903">The first deals with the constitutionality of a state statute with regard to the use by a police officer of all necessary means to effect an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.583" offset="254520">The second is whether the municipality's use of deadly force to apprehend a fleeing burglary suspect after exhausting all other reasonable means is constitutionally permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.743" offset="311153">The reason the city asked for certiorari in this case is that it has a substantial public interest in being able to apprehend persons fleeing from serious crimes such as burglary in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.420" offset="373847">The facts in this case are such that they lend themselves to show that the officer involved had probable cause to believe that a felony had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.560" offset="430376">On the evening of October 3rd, 1974, the police received a call to come to the scene of what was an apparent breaking and entering.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.368" offset="469664">The police arrived on the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.168" offset="476874">They were advised by the next-door neighbor that</text>
            <text syncTime="88.022" offset="492234">"They are breaking in next door. "</text>
            <text syncTime="91.324" offset="505504">The officer then proceeds to survey the situation and then to move into the area where the reported burglary was taking place.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.013" offset="544166">The officer goes down the side of the house, and as doing so, notices as he comes to the rear of the house that there was a window that had been broken, and a garbage can beneath the window, which appeared to him that someone had used the garbage can get up to the window, had broken the window, and then had gained admittance to the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.010" offset="632146">This all took place at approximately 11:00 o'clock in the evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.147" offset="652730">The officer then, as he reaches the back of the house, sees an individual exiting from the house and running toward the back of the yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.288" offset="693272">There was a lot of clutter in the yard at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.407" offset="705811">There was a small mesh fence that was an obstacle to the police officer as he started to move into the back yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.262" offset="741233">There was a chain link fence in the back of the yard which was approximately six feet tall.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.099" offset="772580">The suspect, after exiting the back door, immediately proceeds to the fence, and then pauses at the fence in a stooped position.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.474" offset="814063">The officer gives the command to halt, police.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.859" offset="831617">At this point, the individual turns and looks in the direction of the police officer, and does remain in this stooped position momentarily, and then as the officer is about to make his advance forward to attempt to apprehend the individual, he then begins to jump and vault over the fence, at which time the officer fires, and unfortunately it results in the death of the suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.160" offset="932763">Now, these basically are the facts that are involved, and as I pointed out earlier, there can be little or any question that at the time the officer arrived on the scene, there was probable cause if not more to believe that a burglary in the first degree had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.990" offset="1016146">Burglary in the first degree under Tennessee law is the breaking and entering in a dwelling place in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony, and the Tennessee legislature has determined that burglary is a serious crime, which, if nothing more, is evidenced by the fact that it carries of not less than five, no more than 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.439" offset="1105903">The officer also made the judgment or determination, as he so testified, that he could not apprehend this individual by any other means.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.395" offset="1149788">Now, under Tennessee law, it is clear that an officer must use all means available to apprehend a fleeing felon, and he is only justified in using deadly force as a last resort.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.256" offset="1213214">This officer testified that because of the conditions out at the place, the fact that it was dark, he was unfamiliar with the neighborhood, and that beyond the fence there was growth... I think he described it Johnson grass... which was rather tall, that he knew that once the individual got beyond the fence, there was no chance for him to apprehend, and that's the reason that he used the deadly force to attempt to apprehend.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.775" offset="1339228">Now, in the court proceedings below, the District Court found in favor of all defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.397" offset="1373710">Named in the original action was the City of Memphis, the individual officer who was on the scene, and two supervisory personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.789" offset="1419268">The case was appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and was sent back because in the meantime this Court had decided the Manell case, and that the Court of Appeals decided that the case should be remanded in light of Manell to further consider whether there was any liability on the part of the city.</text>

            <text syncTime="509.545" offset="2178386">Because of the standards placed under the Model Penal Code, it puts an undue burden on law enforcement in situations such as this in attempting to apprehend fleeing felons.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.555" offset="2234392">Because of the standards set out in the Model Penal Code, it requires a police officer to make an on the spot constitutional analysis and still react to the exigencies of an emergency situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1165.305" offset="4801393">Now, I would read that as indicating that if the officer thinks that by shooting to would the person and he can prevent the escape, that he is obligated to do that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wj Michael Cody</label>
            <text syncTime="1237.383" offset="5089681">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in considering the constitutionality of the statute here, I believe that there are two overriding questions for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.392" offset="5141717">First, was the Court of Appeals correct in rejecting the common law rule and establishing as a federal constitutional mandate that deadly force may only be used when the officer has probable cause to believe a violent as distinguished from a nonviolent crime has been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.623" offset="5226667">And secondly, is a federal court under our system of federalism the appropriate body to make this ethical and moral public policy decision, or is it more appropriately left to the state legislature as the elected representatives of the people?</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.319" offset="5309423">And we submit that the answers to these questions will turn on an understanding and a recognition of the state's substantial interest in being able to apprehend serious criminals and preserve the public safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.514" offset="5382252">It is the position of the state that Section 40-7-108 of the Tennessee Code, which is generally an embodiment of the common law rule as it has been construed over the years by the Tennessee Supreme Court, is constitutional as applied to the facts of this case, and as I have indicated, I think there are serious considerations before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.665" offset="5490817">The ethical and the moral judgments of public policy that a society must make are judgments we believe better made in the state legislature than in the federal court, and the ability of the state to effectively apprehend suspects that are fleeing from felony crimes reflects a substantial interest on the part of the state and does not amount, as has been suggested, to punishment of the suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.588" offset="5626549">And in balancing the interests in this case, we are talking about that substantial state interest in apprehending criminal suspects measured against the right of the criminal, who can lawfully submit to arrest and possibly lose his liberty, because if he submits to arrest, he may in all probability for a felony go today to jail, so he loses some of his liberty and freedom, or to disregard the lawful order of the police and risk the possible losing of his life if in the apprehension process the force that was used was deadly force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.235" offset="5817139">These questions, we believe, under the Fourteenth Amendment will allow this Court to recognize that the felon should not have a right to unwarranted protection from apprehension which would jeopardize the public security in not being able to bring a criminal to justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.036" offset="5924345">It is the apprehension process that is necessary before any of the other criminal justice procedures can come into play, and unless the state is able to recognize and to implement its substantial interest in arresting and apprehending felonies, then the state has lost forever its ability to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.924" offset="6051823">And the rule which would allow a fleeing felon to disregard the fact and to say that the police have no threat or no ability to use maximum force if necessary will encourage in property crimes or burglary crimes as we have here, will encourage the criminal to run each time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.573" offset="6154432">If there is a person helping him who merely looks out for the police, all that has to be said is, here come the police, and they know that the police cannot use all necessary force to apprehend them, and it becomes basically a foot race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.503" offset="6238128">The Court of Appeals drew the line in its setting up, we think, of a constitutional mandate based on a Model Penal Code rule which is at variance with at least half of the state rules between violent and nonviolent felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.183" offset="6316913">We believe that there are other indicators of the state's substantial interest in apprehending criminals other than violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.589" offset="6350559">And if the Court will allow me, I would like to leave--</text>

            <text syncTime="1818.529" offset="7414265">Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to start by trying to address some of the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.999" offset="7440179">In answer to Justice Stevens' question, the maximum penalty for fleeing from an officer under the Memphis Code is a $50 fine, and that is... the citation for that is Footnote 31 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.491" offset="7486154">In reference to the question about the workability of the standard adopted by the Court of Appeals asked by Justices O'Connor and Blackmun and Justice Powell, we would point out that not only do the majority of the states apply a rule consonant with the rule adopted by the Court of Appeals, but the overwhelming majority of municipal police departments in this country, something at the rate of 75 percent, apply a rule similar to that adopted by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.791" offset="7595346">The experience under these statutes and under these municipal policies has been investigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.697" offset="7622931">I would point the Court to the amicus brief filed by the various police organizations in over 30 individual police departments in this country, from common law and non-common law states alike, in support of our position in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.872" offset="7675594">They recount the studies that have been done in these jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.607" offset="7686566">Arrest rates do not go down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.675" offset="7694820">Crime rates do not go up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.093" offset="7708508">The only thing that is affected by a more restrictive deadly force policy is the rate of officer safety, and the rate of officer safety improves under these more restrictive policies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1956.703" offset="7967016">In this particular case, the officer, when he ordered Garner to halt, and Garner did halt, the officer was able to see Garner.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven L. Winter</label>
            <text syncTime="1973.045" offset="8032322">No, but the officer had no reason to believe that there were any dead bodies in the house, and I think that is a critical point, because one of the major differences between our position and the position of the city and the state is that they would premise the right to kill of a police officer on what the officer does not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.743" offset="8107137">But this Court has held, and I am thinking of Your Honor's opinion for the Court in Brown versus Texas, that the Fourth Amendment requires police actions to be governed by what the officer does know, specific objective facts indicating society's legitimate interests that require a seizure of the particular individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.469" offset="8174010">The Fourth Amendment answers that question for us, because it requires that specific objective knowledge on the part of a police officer before he acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.541" offset="8206298">Now, Justice Powell asked about the nature of the crime and the punishment for first degree burglary in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.882" offset="8255721">We would point out that the Court ought to be clear about the nature of the underlying crime in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.753" offset="8275157">First of all, if Garner had been guilty of first degree burglary, the punishment would have been a maximum of 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.090" offset="8300548">This first degree burglary statute is the equivalent of the third degree burglary statute in South Dakota that the Court discussed in Solon versus Helm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.346" offset="8333566">It defines the exact same crime, with the selfsame punishment of 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.649" offset="8354778">It is not a first degree burglary statute like many other states such as New York that define first degree burglary as a life-endangering burglary where the burglar may be armed or where harm results to a victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.941" offset="8399917">So, although it is first degree as a matter of Tennessee law, this is not the first degree crime defined by many of the states, and is equivalent to the third degree burglary that this Court has already addressed in Solon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.847" offset="8443594">I would point out that the Court in Solon versus Helm recognized what is in fact the case, that this kind of third degree burglary is a nonviolent crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.605" offset="8482569">It is a property crime, a property crime listed under crimes against property in the Tennessee code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.507" offset="8502213">Numerous state courts have observed what this Court observed in Solon, that burglary is not a violent crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.860" offset="8527604">I am thinking of the Lewis case in Florida, cited in our brief, as well as the Brown case from Alaska, and this is cited in the city's reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.782" offset="8559264">In Brown the Alaska Supreme Court held that burglary was a serious crime against property, but not per se a violent crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="2135.051" offset="8680368">He thought Garner was 17, possibly 18 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.120" offset="8692593">Under Tennessee law, he could not have been prosecuted for burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.807" offset="8711401">Based on the actual facts, at 15 he absolutely could not have been prosecuted as a felon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.361" offset="8733553">He would only have been assigned to the juvenile courts, and perhaps adjudged delinquent, which is an expressly noncriminal status under Tennessee law, and ever under what the officer reasonably believed, that he was 17, it was likely that he would not be transferred to the adult courts under the statutes in effect in 1974, but would have similarly been assigned only to the juvenile courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2203.765" offset="8955176">So, the answer to Your Honor's question, he could have been treated as an adult for murder, but not for the burglary that he in fact committed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2338.834" offset="9495493">In our view, this case presents really three issues for the Court to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.788" offset="9515346">There is a constitutionality of the state statute and the municipal policy as applied to this case, given the facts, a nonviolent, nondangerous fleeing property crime suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.230" offset="9557037">There is the question of the constitutionality of the city's policies and customs that encourage, in fact, encourage and insulate the use of excessive force where officers do not exhaust reasonable alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.769" offset="9599251">And finally, the question of whether the Memphis policy is in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment because it is racially discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.192" offset="9628926">Our position before this Court on the first issue, that is, the constitutionality of the statute, is that the Court of Appeals is clearly correct that a statute is only narrowly drawn to express a legitimate state interest at stake, and is only carefully tailored to its underlying justification if it permits the shooting when safety interests are at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.890" offset="9723699">And the Court ought to be clear about what is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.875" offset="9735610">This is not a case about shooting to wound or a case about apprehension at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.794" offset="9755359">The Memphis policy is not to shoot to wound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.546" offset="9766330">It is explicitly not so.</text>

            <text syncTime="2461.765" offset="9987222">Officer Hyman, who fired in this case, so testified, that he fired as he was taught, at the torso, and he shot to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.538" offset="10022330">The police director's testimony, Director Hubbard, is found at Page 1,500 of the record.</text>
