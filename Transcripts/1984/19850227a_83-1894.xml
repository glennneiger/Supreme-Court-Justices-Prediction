            <text syncTime="13.543" offset="180119">Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question in this case is whether the National Labor Relations Board is correct in its ruling that all Union rules placing restrictions on the time and circumstances under which a member may resign from the Union are invalidated by Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.168" offset="334659">The facts which raise that question are these: The Pattern Makers' Union adopted a provision in its constitution and bylaws which we set out at page 3 of our brief, the blue brief, which states:</text>
            <text syncTime="74.579" offset="424207">"No resignation or withdrawal from an Assocication or from the League shall be accepted during a strike or lockout or at a time when a strike or lockout appears imminent. "</text>
            <text syncTime="88.013" offset="478019">That provision was considered at the Union's convention in 1976 and then was sent to a referendum of the Union's members, and finally approved and became effective in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.427" offset="547609">Thereafter, a strike did ensue, involving the Rockford and Beloit local Unions of the Pattern Makers' Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.951" offset="613751">some eleven members of those local Unions put in resignations during the strike and went back to work thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.071" offset="662235">The Union, when the strike was finally settled, sought to impose Union discipline on these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.066" offset="714166">Charges were served, a trial was held, and the result was that the case went to the National Labor Relations Board on the allegation that the Union's action in seeking to discipline these individuals for violating the Union's underlying rule that engaging in strike-breaking activity is unlawful as a matter of Union law, violated Section 8(b)(1)(A).</text>

            <text syncTime="388.905" offset="1681533">The only argument I can see the other way is that there is some choice of remedies or waiver by the Union.</text>

            <text syncTime="397.433" offset="1715701">Usually, Unions seek to go one way or the other initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.509" offset="1732001">In many Unions, the complaint, internal complaint filed against the members, says what the penalty being sought will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.458" offset="1771812">And some Union constitutions provide that if the only penalty that can be imposed is that which the member has been given fair notice of, so that he can make his determination whether to defend or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.142" offset="1822489">Some people faced with expulsion wouldn't choose to defend, and it would be unfair to come around later and try to collect a fine from them.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.022" offset="1917993">The argument we make here is that the language and legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act shows that Congress gave the most mature and complete consideration to the entire question of the extent to which the Labor Board should be empowered to regulate the Union/Member relationship, and that in particular, the House of Representatives proposed that it be an unfair labor practice for a Union to limit resignation in any way, shape, or form; where the Senate took a quite different view.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.393" offset="2119554">And that conference report demonstrates in this instance, as in many others, that the House receded to the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.732" offset="2156857">In other words, our position here is that Congress made a considered decision to deny the Labor Board the authority to dictate to Unions what their rules should be on who may join the Union, the conditions under which that person may join, position, the conditions under which he may be expelled, and the conditions under which he may otherwise leave the Union.</text>

            <text syncTime="1312.219" offset="5374829">Now, the Board which admits that all of these materials are embodiments of Congress' will and have to be explained, says that while no one... no one... so stated at the time, the real agenda of the conference was by adding the words the 7, which had not been in the Senate bill, it was the intent to create a right to resign at will, quite aside from the fact that that doesn't face up to what happened to Section 7(b) and 8(c)(4).</text>

            <text syncTime="1536.565" offset="6272187">The Textile Workers case and all of the decisions through the Court's decision in Machinists &amp; Boeing say that the Union/Member relationship is no greater than the contract created by the Union's constitution, and that union's have no right to take disciplinary action against non-members without engaging in a wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.694" offset="6388693">The question here is whether the Board has the power to truncate the Union member contract by substituting its view that there is something somewhere in some brooding omnipresence in the sky that says that every Union rule limiting the right to resign is an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.042" offset="6498094">And our point is that nothing in Section 7(a), nothing in Section 7 as enacted, nothing in Section 8(b)(1), authorizes the Board to create that unfair labor practice; that the provision to 8(b)(1)(A) in terms denies the Board that authority, and that the legislative history shows that Section 7 was not intended to give the Board that authority, and that the fate of Sections 7(b) and 8(c)(4) demonstrates that this was not an issue of which Congress was unaware, but rather an issue where there were two different views.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.010" offset="6666009">The House's view was the Union/Member relationship should be regulated, regulated in detail, and in particular regulated on when people should resign The view of the Senate was that Congress should not move to that point, should not say who could be a Union member, how long he would be a Union member if he chose to be a Union member, and when he would get out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.688" offset="6760677">But they were not going to tell the Unions what to do on those kinds of rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.090" offset="6790352">And it was the Senate view that prevailed, and the Board here, as in Insurance Agents, where the Court said that the first issue is did Congress ask the Board to answer a particular question and said that it had not, is the same here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.988" offset="6873944">The Board just has not been given the authority to determine what Union resignation rules are good anymore than what the Union finds are reasonable.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="1721.552" offset="7012184">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, having decided that a Union commits an unfair labor practice by seeking court-enforceable fines against members who have resigned to go back to work during a strike, the Court considers today the Board ruling that a Union may not accomplish precisely the same result by recasting its rule so as to forbid strike resignations by those who would go back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.617" offset="7144364">Now, in considering that Board ruling, I respectfully remind the Court that the Court has frequently said that the interpretation of the Act is in the first instance for the Board, and that that interpretation by the Board of its Act is due great deference, so long as its interpretation is... and I quote Mr. Justice Stewart in the American Shipbuilding case...</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.654" offset="7244569">"not inconsistent with the fundamental structure of the Act. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.667" offset="7264631">Therefore, I think it is helpful to consider at the outset what the fundamental structure of the Act is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.461" offset="7295769">And surely there is nothing more fundamental to the structure of the Act than Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.365" offset="7319384">Section 7 of the Wagner Act, an Act of 1935, was the centerpiece of that piece of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.158" offset="7354597">It was the great charter of liberties of the Union movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.173" offset="7370584">Employees shall have the right to self-organization and to engage in considered activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.871" offset="7401409">In 1947, the Congress sought to enlarge that charter of liberties and to add... and I quote here from the preamble of the Taft-Hartley Act... "further rights"... and I quote here...</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.318" offset="7475178">"to protect the rights of individual employees in their relations with labor organizations. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.643" offset="7500465">So that when the first part of Section 7 was enacted, it protected the rights of employees, vis a vis employers; the second part, which added the words</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.013" offset="7549993">"and shall also have the right to refrain from any and all such activities. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.511" offset="7576011">created an enlargement and a symmetry in speaking of the individual's rights vis a vis labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.162" offset="7614568">Now, in the early days of Section 7 of the Wagner Act, employers regularly came to the Board and came to the Court to argue that they had made bargains with employees in which employees had bargained away those great rights, and they had made fair bargains, reasonable bargains, bargains for a limited time only, and that the employees had struck those bargains with their eyes open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.151" offset="7730551">And the Board and the Court regularly turned those arguments down, saying that Section 7 rights cannot be bargained away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.537" offset="7768063">The great case in this Court is National Licorice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.849" offset="7777363">What the Board does here in its understanding of the fundamental structure of the Act is that the right in the second part of Section 7 also cannot be bargained away, no matter how fair the Union provision is, no matter how limited in scope, and no matter that the member entered into this bargain, bargaining away his rights with his eyes open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.416" offset="7891570">So there is a symmetry here and the structure which the Board discerns seems to us to be a structure which makes sense, which is a coherent structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.881" offset="7937441">Indeed, the only exception which Section 7 admits this right to refrain relates to Union security clauses, and this Court was most emphatic over a generation ago in the General Motors case, that Union may not, by Union security clauses, demand any more than financial core membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.402" offset="8035557">That is to say, such an allegiance which does not submit an individual worker to Union discipline.</text>

            <text syncTime="1997.643" offset="8116537">Over the last dozen years, Justice O'Connor, the Board in every major case has held that a Union attempt to impose court-enforceable fines on workers who would go back to work during a strike, when those workers have indicated their desire no longer to be affiliated with the Union, constitutes an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.898" offset="8221549">So we don't have here some dramatic U-turn in the position of the Board, but a consistent picture which the Board has been elaborating since this issue first surfaced, and a picture which this Court has twice added its hand to the elaboration of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.766" offset="8296991">Now, the Petitioners rely very heavily on the provision of Section 8(b)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.168" offset="8342653">They rely on the proviso which reserves to the Union the right to make rules regarding the acquisition and retention of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.646" offset="8392494">The Board's reading of that proviso, we submit, is a perfectly natural reading, but also a reading which carries forward a consistent, a coherent picture of the structure of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.657" offset="8444530">For what it says on one hand under Section 7, is the employee's relation to the Union is wholly voluntary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2819.609" offset="11404413">I would suggest that the picture which the Petitioners give of the word "retention" in that proviso is a picture which is similar to the word "detention", that it means that a Union is empowered to hold on to a member who no longer wishes to be a member.</text>

            <text syncTime="2962.285" offset="11975031">Since the statute says not a word about fining Union members, it's in that case that that right was established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.297" offset="12015155">But the Allis-Chalmers case emphasized that the power to impose court-enforceable fines was predicated on the fact that the fined person "enjoyed full Union membership", and that what was at stake was purely internal... internal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.707" offset="12128736">Now, the state law on voluntary associations is said to clearly require, to clearly recognize the right of a voluntary association to restrict the right of members to resign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.967" offset="12193833">And in this regard, the Petitioners rely on the weighty authority of corpus juris secundum.</text>

            <text syncTime="3030.664" offset="12248586">Second, which says that a member may lawfully resign at any time from an association or club, and a bylaw which restricts this right or makes the withdrawal subject to the organization's approval is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.924" offset="12309608">Well, the fact of the matter is, I would give no great weight to either of these weighty authorities because the fact of the matter is that the common law of voluntary associations is underdeveloped and in conflict on the subject of whether an association may or may not restrict an individual in his attempt to resign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.805" offset="12401141">One thing, however, is quite clear; that those cases... and there are cases, common law cases, which recognize an association's right to restrict a member's resignation... all make it quite clear that those restrictions will be placed under the strictest court scrutiny to see whether they comport with state public policy of fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.996" offset="12513885">The question which this Court must consider is whether the issue, not of the reasonableness of a Union fine, which this Court clearly remits to state law, but the question of the outer perimeters of the Union/Member relationship should also be remitted to 50 varying state court policies, so that in one state such a restriction is unreasonable; in another state such a restriction does comport with public policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3340.007" offset="13485954">Had the Board decided that a Union is entitled to insist on certain formalities in processing strike resignations, and maybe even including a brief delay during which the Union absorbs the fact that these men are, in fact, resigning, that might well be within the discretion of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.170" offset="13586577">But a restriction as extensive as 30 days raises the very gravest doubts in our mind about it's consistent with those Section 7 rights and the notion that those rights may not be bargained away.</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.205" offset="13682813">It would be a harder case for our opposition, but I don't believe, Mr. Justice Blackmun, that it would be a decision which we would care to defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.404" offset="13731609">I would like to simply underline one matter in terms of the effect of this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.666" offset="13768599">For, though the Board adheres fast to the right of a member to leave the Union and escape the rule, the Court must remember that this is not a costless option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.114" offset="13822411">The Union continues to be the mandatory bargaining representative of that worker, and in choosing to resign, he loses his voice and he loses his voice most particularly in regard to the question of whether he may participate in a vote to take that unit out on strike, and he loses his voice in deciding whether to accept a new contract... a new contract to end the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.664" offset="13948635">So there is a penalty, there is a price that the man pays when he exists, when he exercises his right under free institutions to exit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.613" offset="13988445">Finally, I might say that over the years, employers have found no more effective tactic in arguing against Union representation than to urge that Union membership is like joining the Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.480" offset="14063887">Now, it seems to me that the Board's ruling here would establish once and for all the notion that Union membership is a free relationship, voluntary on both sides, and this may very well open the way to a more solid form of solidarity, based indeed on the fact of an intrinsic loyalty.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Stephen Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="3515.015" offset="14186035">I would like to warmly impress on the Court Judge Lernard Hand's injunction that the task of both agencies and courts is to recreate the gamut of values extant at the time from the legislative materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.382" offset="14251446">My brother Fried did everything, other than talk about what Congress said and did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.974" offset="14273807">And the overall picture he drew, I would suggest, is it has nothing to do with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.190" offset="14298675">What is self-organization?</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.503" offset="14307975">What is freedom of association?</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.236" offset="14318842">It is not, and was not in Congress's eyes, the right of every individual to join the organization if he wishes and to leave if he wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.107" offset="14354369">Of course, the very point of the proviso was to recognize that freedom of association is a group freedom, and the group creates its rules on who may join and who may not join.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.648" offset="14404524">An individual who walks up to a Union and says I want to join, but I won't abide by these rules, can be rejected because Congress's view of the freedom of association was the contractual view, the view stated by this Court in Democratic Party of the United States, and not the view that Mr. Fried creates out of whole cloth, and that's the Board, without paying the least bit of attention to what Congress was willing to do and not willing to do, enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.685" offset="14520716">This bill was a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.199" offset="14530747">The issue of whether there would be a perfect freedom to join and leave was joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.069" offset="14562199">The determination was that there would be a different contractual relationship of the kind always recognized in common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.347" offset="14595322">There is no case saying that this kind of restriction is no good, and indeed there would be a zero issue here if, under the normal law of membership associations, these kinds of restrictions had not always been recognized.</text>
