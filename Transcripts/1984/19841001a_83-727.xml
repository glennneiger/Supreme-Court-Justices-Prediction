            <text syncTime="114.689" offset="588213">This is a case involving the interpretation and application of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination against the handicapped in federally funded programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.401" offset="651012">At issue is whether the Tennessee Medicaid program discriminated against the handicapped by reducing the number of inpatient hospital days provided each Medicaid recipient in a fiscal year from 20 until 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.096" offset="721856">The district court ruled that the change did not violate Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.500" offset="743485">A three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit in a split decision found a prima facie violation of Section 504, reversed and remanded in order to allow the state to rebut the prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.593" offset="803776">The change which the Tennessee Medicaid program took in this case was an across-the-board deduction in inpatient hospital days from 14... from 20 days to 14 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.536" offset="867619">It excluded no one.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.487" offset="875351">It applied equally to the handicapped as well as the nonhandicapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.041" offset="897607">This change was necessary because the Tennessee constitution prohibits deficit spending, and our program was in a condition that it would run out of money unless certain changes were made in order to reduce the financial commitment of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.972" offset="981304">And this change itself was made along with others which made the budget possible to have the Medicaid program run throughout the year and serve the public recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.298" offset="1042639">This change, the state submits, was authorized by the Medicaid statutes and the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.968" offset="1073359">Congress has given the states discretion in setting benefit and service levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.991" offset="1105438">There are two restrictions that Congress places on those levels of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.645" offset="1128007">First, the level must be sufficient in amount, in duration, and in scope in order to achieve the purpose of the program; and secondly, the level must be set equally for everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.689" offset="1200210">In addition to the Medicaid law, the State of Tennessee submits that the charge is consistent with the purpose of Section 504 and the specific regulations under Section 504 which refer to benefits and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.235" offset="1270427">The purpose of Section 504, we submit, is the evenhanded treatment of handicapped, not affirmative action in order to overcome disabilities which are caused by handicapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.745" offset="1332390">In the regulations which particularly refer to benefits and services, the regulation says that services are required to be equally effective, but in order to be equally effective, the benefits are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement for the handicapped and the nonhandicapped persons, but must afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to obtain the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.020" offset="1481496">In order to violate Section 504, we submit, we would have had to extend a lesser number of inpatient hospital days to the handicapped than to the nonhandicapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.862" offset="1536876">The district court recognized this and found that there was no discrimination under 504 when an equal number of hospital days were provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.920" offset="1585150">The court of appeals, however, felt that a prima facie case was made because on the statistics introduced, the 14 days limitation was unable to meet the hospital needs of the handicapped to the same extent as the nonhandicapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.452" offset="1679296">So even if an effects test is applied, a violation or a prima facie violation of Section 504 requires a finding that the handicapped were affected unequally with respect to some program benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.962" offset="1745333">Here, the benefit which the state is providing, the 14 days of inpatient hospital care, is provided equally to all eligible for the program.</text>

            <text syncTime="459.899" offset="1969046">They... we contend that the benefit which is provided in this service is a certain number of inpatient hospital days.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.356" offset="2006871">And I might add as the Solicitor General points out in his brief, if you look at the studies, the disproportionate result is even greater at 19 days than it is at 14, so the cut... the figures would show that less handicapped needs proportional to nonhandicapped are met at 19 days than at what we cut it back to at 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.940" offset="2121183">But what we think the statute does is it provides equal access to the program, to the benefits, equal opportunity to receive those benefits, and not an equal result.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.449" offset="2183250">And that's what these figures really are dealing with; that it takes more hospital days to have certain handicappeds reach full recovery or to get all of their hospital benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="574.690" offset="2428174">Those are specific employment regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.908" offset="2441131">In the benefit and services regulation we have argued in our brief, first, that if you go back to Title VI or Section 504 and look at Bakke and this Court's majority opinion in Guardians, that Section 504, as Darrone indicates, is a mirror image of Title VI, and that Title VI only prohibits intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.261" offset="2566519">Justice Stevens, I think, went further, however, and said if... if that's correct, the regulations can provide an effects test even if the statute does not; but he qualified that to say if the regulations are in furtherance of the statute, and that's where we think there is a problem here in applying effects regulations to benefits and services afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.113" offset="2689921">The handicapped are not a homogenous group of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.450" offset="2715207">There are many different subtypes of handicaps that require tremendous social services.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.706" offset="2744256">And in this particular situation, any time that you have users of social welfare programs such as the handicapped in this case, if you place any limits on the benefit, you're going to have this disproportionate result occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.219" offset="2830355">But we contend that that disproportionate result is not disparity or discrimination within the meaning of... of Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.844" offset="2876853">And the important consideration, I think, for the Court to see is that 504 requires equal access to the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.502" offset="2931501">As the respondent argues, is a person excluded from the program when he runs out of the 14 days?</text>
            <text syncTime="709.893" offset="2969013">Isn't that lack of access to the program, or have we excluded that person from the program?</text>
            <text syncTime="717.147" offset="2998061">I don't think that we have when it is merely a limit on the program and one which is consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.855" offset="3040902">When that service runs out or the benefit runs out, it's just been used up, and it doesn't mean that that person is excluded from the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.060" offset="3081653">If this case... if we had to go to a prima facie finding just on the basis of disproportionate results that the handicappeds didn't receive as much health care as they might need and nonhandicapped did, then you would allow litigants every time that any change is made in a social welfare program such as this, that they could come in and if they are greater users, they would show this disproportion, and the state would have to litigate each and every one of those situations, and you would find that a very uncertain program would be present.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="829.736" offset="3448412">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="833.255" offset="3462519">The Government's central concern here is to show why the particular version of the discriminatory impact theory that was adopted by the court of appeals in this case, why that version of this theory is really quite radically wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.835" offset="3540781">And for that purpose I'll start out by emphasizing that this case is not simply about the validity of the 14-day rule, or about the validity of a reduction from 20 to 14 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.159" offset="3594071">Suppose Tennessee today abandoned its 14-day rule, went back to its previous 20-day rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.915" offset="3621134">Would this quarrel be over?</text>
            <text syncTime="874.849" offset="3628866">Not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.284" offset="3634613">It's perfectly clear from the record that a rule that limits reimbursements for inpatient hospital care to 20 days has a more severe differential impact on the handicapped than the 14-day rule; that is to say, the handicappeds form a larger percentage of those who need more than 20 days of hospitalization than of those who need 14 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.499" offset="3735446">In fact, the odd thing about this case is that the higher the Tennessee limit went, if Tennessee had a 60-day limit, we might get to the point where those who have a... are excluded by such a limit may constitute 100 percent of the people with chronic and handicapped condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.330" offset="3814754">Or take the alternative that the court of appeals seemed to find attractive, which is to limit not the number of days of inpatient care, but the number of admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.720" offset="3864282">It seems to the Government clear that that rule would be incredibly vulnerable to the theory of the court of appeals, because it would cut against all of those who suffer from those illnesses that need very frequent hospitalizations; that is, people who suffer from chronic and therefore handicapping conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.801" offset="3948605">And the respondents' own solution here, which is to have the limit set in terms of the number of days per admission, would that rule not have a disparate impact on the handicapped under the theory of the court of appeals?</text>
            <text syncTime="971.761" offset="4016523">We don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.929" offset="4021121">I think if you set a limit of three days in the hospital for an appendectomy, or six days in a hospital for a heart bypass, it seems clear that that's most likely to be insufficient for those who suffer from some other complicating chronic or handicapping condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.474" offset="4095309">So the point here is that the court of appeals' version of the discriminatory impact is fatal to any across-the-board attempt to limit or allocate Medicaid funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.698" offset="4140239">Any funding limit or allocation is going to entail some kind of differential in terms of result on some members of some protected group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.173" offset="4190185">That's why we think that there has to be something very fundamentally wrong with the theory of the court of appeals, and in our brief we try to clarify what has gone wrong here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.247" offset="4238460">We think that analytically what has gone wrong is that the court of appeals tried to solve the question of what is discrimination without first analyzing what is the relevant program or activity or benefit as to which 504 prohibits discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.894" offset="4317036">We submit that that question cannot be answered by reference to 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.779" offset="4336576">That question must be solved by looking at what program Tennessee has set up here and what program the Medicaid statute funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.986" offset="4377431">The... Tennessee is free to set up whatever program it wants to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.657" offset="4404076">That program must, of course, be harmonious with the federal subsidy statute, here the Medicaid Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.413" offset="4435110">Now, this is the matrix as to which 504 applies, and here we think the relevant program or benefit which has been undertaken and subsidized is not the satisfaction of health needs, but the provision of a given level of health services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.058" offset="4513686">Now, the other point I'd like to make, Your Honors, is that at a conceptual level what is troubling here is that the court of appeals' theory of discrimination simply dissolves all possible distinctions between nondiscrimination on the one hand and a major affirmative action program to aid the handicapped on the other.</text>
