            <text syncTime="22.346" offset="258308">This case is a test case, having been so designated by the plaintiffs, having been so treated by the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.087" offset="301253">As is in many cases before this Court, the decision will reach far beyond the boundaries of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.891" offset="328525">In this case in particular, it will reach much beyond the boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.279" offset="350050">The 1974 opinion in this case has already spawned a vast number of Indian land claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.568" offset="391219">A number of cases are pending throughout eastern states and southern states, citing the 1974 jurisdictional opinion as if it were an opinion on the merits of the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.144" offset="441478">That case, indeed, has already been cited 162 times since 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.398" offset="470527">This case has some history in it, and I checked to see how many opinions were rendered by the Supreme Court of the United States between 1790 and 1795, the date on which the transaction in issue occurred here, and there were only 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.526" offset="539072">What is involved here is a purchase of land by the State of New York from the Oneida Indian Nation in 1795.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.567" offset="583167">The claim, filed about 175 years later, is that the State of New York failed to comply with the restrictions and limitations contained in the second Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, the Trade and Intercourse Act of 1793, and the claim is that as a result, the Oneida Indians, rather than the Counties of Madison and Oneida and the others who live in the claim area, the 100,000 acres involved, presently own that land.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.955" offset="716705">Own is a word that is important because the Oneida Indians are, as this Court has recognized, an institution with a degree and element of sovereignty in it, so that owning the land by the Oneida Indians is quite a bit different than owning it by someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.952" offset="796744">The Trade and Intercourse Acts were first passed in 1790 by the very first Congress of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.456" offset="826732">A principal question to be decided in this case is what was the intent of that Congress in passing the first Trade and Intercourse Acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.880" offset="872394">To get back for a moment to the point you adverted to earlier, this is a case about ownership and not about sovereignty as such, I take it here.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.137" offset="913459">What I meant to suggest was that when ownership is in an Indian tribe as opposed to an individual Indian or another individual, you have to deal with the elements of sovereignty that are inherent in being an Indian tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.962" offset="968734">You cannot avoid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.481" offset="974794">So this really is a case that implicates the sovereignty of the Indian nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.116" offset="993393">If they own the land, they are sovereigns over it to at least a degree as permitted by the current law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan van Gestel</label>
            <text syncTime="215.491" offset="1030905">No, there would not have to be a reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.957" offset="1040727">As I read the cases of this Court, simply land owned by an Indian tribe or nation is land that is subject to the sovereign rights and powers of that Indian nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.766" offset="1092032">It does not have to be a reservation created, let's say, by the Congress of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.920" offset="1120558">I think then we do then turn to the issue of whether the first Congress or the Congress in 1793 which passed the second Trade and Intercourse Act, intended that there would be a private right of action available under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.764" offset="1183983">And in so doing, we look to the recent work of this Court, starting principally in 1975 with Cort v. Ash and the cases that have flown therefrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.488" offset="1230899">We have a situation here in which there is a statute which is comprehensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.891" offset="1252528">It deals with the subject of regulating and managing the affairs with the Indian tribes and nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.731" offset="1279800">It draws its power, its basis from the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.235" offset="1309893">If we look at the kind of analysis that this Court has suggested is appropriate on the issue of whether there is or is not a private right of action, it seems to me the cases of this Court in recent years indicate that no private right of action should be determined to exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.530" offset="1379065">I would initially hearken back, we have cited in our brief to the words of James Madison, who was the man who introduced the 1793 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.737" offset="1423891">There he said at the time, misunderstandings, quarrels and wars with Indians had originated from the circumstance of persons having obtained through fraud and other improper means possession of lands belonging to Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.597" offset="1487317">This consideration rendered it highly important that this whole business should be under the absolute and sole direction of public authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.238" offset="1533919">Turning to the statutory language, which is where we should first go to determine whether there is a private right of action, you will find that there is no mention in the statute whatsoever of creating a private right.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.497" offset="1590866">You will also find, however, that there are remedies and provisions provided in the statute that deal with instances in which it is violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.853" offset="1628378">It is principally a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.872" offset="1636424">There are provisions for criminal fines.</text>

            <text syncTime="1096.374" offset="4554406">I would suggest one other thing while I am talking about the issue of the statute of limitations, and that is the issue of abatement that we have raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.895" offset="4592545">The Indian Trade and Intercourse Act is not a single statute that has been in existence since 1790 down to the present date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.735" offset="4619816">Indeed, when you examine it you will see that it is a series of separate, specifically limited statutes in the early years, 1790, 1793, 1796, '99 and 1802.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.559" offset="4675196">It wasn't until 1834 that it became a single statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.947" offset="4692750">And with the expiration of each statute, any claims that may have existed, assuming you find there to be a right of action under it, would abate under the law as it applied at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.854" offset="4744368">Now, I think another thing that we have to discuss and have to consider in dealing with this kind of case, another defense, is a defense of ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.662" offset="4795568">The law, it would seem, suggests... and have in mind that the concern here is that the State of New York, when it purchased the land in 1795, did not do it in the presence of a federal commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.457" offset="4858785">That is the deficiency, and the sole deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.242" offset="4869860">The State of New York a couple of years later, in 1798, purchased some additional land in the presence of a federal commissioner, and nobody has any concern or argues that that was in any way inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.466" offset="4922732">Cases have determined that ratification of these kinds of transactions can occur after the transactions themselves have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.357" offset="4966305">That is, if the federal government takes certain steps that demonstrate that there is a knowledge of the transaction and there is an implicit ratification, then that is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.986" offset="5040910">We have set forth in our brief a number of instances in which that ratification applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.674" offset="5071630">In particular, the next two purchases by the State of New York from the Oneida Indians, in adjacent land, were purchases that were made in the presence of the appropriate federal commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.982" offset="5120845">They were purchases that were appropriate in every respect under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.620" offset="5139444">Those purchases made reference back to the 1795 purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.588" offset="5159297">They described it as a purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.207" offset="5169746">They did the kinds of things that the subsequent cases have suggested as sufficient to retroactively ratify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.630" offset="5199421">But in addition to that, we have had 175 years, approximately, of history, of the federal government acting with regard to the land in issue here as if that land was owned by the people who live on it today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.239" offset="5265877">The federal government has taken land and built post offices, it has built federal highways, it has taxed people, it has done everything that you would expect it to do to in effect say to those citizens, yes, this is your land and you own it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1457.944" offset="6000649">A finding for the Indians means in effect that 100,000 acres of land falls under the sovereignty of an Indian tribe.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter H. Schiff</label>
            <text syncTime="1854.418" offset="7586595">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.786" offset="7600074">As indicated, we of course do fully support the arguments of the counties that the court below erred in holding the counties liable to the Indians on the basis of the alleged violation of the 1793 Trade and Intercourse Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.847" offset="7676352">So in that sense we would certainly hope that the Court never reaches the Eleventh Amendment argument which I am about to make because it will be totally unnecessary if you hold for us on the first argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.643" offset="7747509">But we do believe that the courts below also erred in holding the states liable for indemnification in this federal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.384" offset="7798500">The state has not waived its immunity except in a very limited sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.687" offset="7819712">There is a provision, as we point out in our brief, for recovery when there is a failure of title of land from the state, but the recovery there is only for the purchase or acquisition price, and without interest, so that... and that recovery would be in the Court of Claims in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.286" offset="7906020">We don't think that there is any other recovery, but if there were, that would have to be determined in the New York Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.690" offset="7931725">And of course, the law is clear that even if there were any waiver for suits within a state court, that would not permit suits in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.966" offset="7988776">The court below seems to have decided against the state on the indemnification ground for what appear to be two separate bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.441" offset="8046664">One, they made a finding that there was ancillary jurisdiction because the claims of the counties against the state allegedly rose out of he same core of facts as the Indians' claim against the counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.569" offset="8111238">And secondly, the court found that the state, by making the purchases from the Indians under the treaty in 1795, had allegedly waived its immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.264" offset="8181978">The counties in their brief indicated that they took the view that these two positions were interdependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.905" offset="8228580">In other words, I think the counties conceded that unless there was a finding of waiver within the meaning of the various Eleventh Amendment cases, that they could not prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.130" offset="8273407">I think that the decision below may have gone even further and may have... and seems to have read ancillary jurisdiction as not necessarily depending on there being an Eleventh Amendment waiver of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.303" offset="8330145">We think that on that latter point, this Court's decision in the Pennhurst case last term pretty well decided, I think, that for the purpose of ancillary jurisdiction just like appendant jurisdiction, that there has to be a separate basis for jurisdiction, and that where there is a defense of sovereign immunity by the state, ancillary jurisdiction would not attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.973" offset="8444770">So I will not dwell on that but will turn on the question of whether under this Court's precedents there was a waiver of immunity with respect to the counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.136" offset="8525436">In that sense, I think it is important, and there may not be any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.438" offset="8542677">We do not believe that there has been any waiver or there would be any waiver even with respect to the relationship with the Indians, but that issue does not necessarily come into play here because there is no suit against the state by the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.800" offset="8608087">But looking at that overall question, we think that this Court's decision in Edelman v. Jordan is really quite dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.405" offset="8646540">As we understand that case, there would be no waiver unless in the very first instance the suit under which waiver is being sought provides for a... suits that in terms includes actions against a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.669" offset="8731594">Now, whatever can be said about this particular case, there is no statute which in terms provides for suits against anyone, let alone the state, and the argument is going to be made, of course, that there is either an implied common law right of action or that it is implied under the Trade and Intercourse Act, with which we don't agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.521" offset="8846951">But there is no argument that there is any statutory provision for a suit against anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.158" offset="8869521">And the county does argue that that should make no difference if the Court implies a cause of action against it or against them, then in turn the Court should imply that there is a, in terms of the possibility of a suit against the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.690" offset="8967637">Now, it seems to us that that would undermine what appears to be the logic behind the Edelman test which, taking into account that Congress does not lightly impute waivers to the state, or even the possibility that the state might waive its sovereign immunity, where there is no specific provision in terms for suits that might include the state, the state, by acting under a statute, would have no idea that it might be liable for suit because no one else was specifically liable for suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.546" offset="9119147">So that in this case the absence of any express provision for suit makes the test in Edelman totally inapplicable, and the state could not have waived its immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2297.520" offset="9358951">There is an additional argument made that, well, that test shouldn't apply in this case because what happened here happened in 1795, and that the Trade and Intercourse Act preceded the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment, which probably became effective in 1795 as well, and with little debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.771" offset="9472009">I don't think that makes any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.456" offset="9478696">The fact is that this Court has explained on numerous occasions the state's immunity from suits by its own citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.431" offset="9530628">In this case, it would be the county, does not actually literally stem from the Eleventh Amendment, but it really inheres in the provisions of the Constitution in Article 3, which was recently reiterated in the Pennhurst case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.956" offset="9592695">But it was... that was first played out I think in Hans v. Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.860" offset="9616309">If you will recall, the Eleventh Amendment arose because of the case of Chisholm v. Georgia, which involved a suit by a citizen of South Carolina right after the beginning of the Republic, against the State of Georgia, and the citizen of South Carolina relied upon the provision in the Constitution which provided for suits against a state and citizens of another state, and this Court agreed that that provided jurisdiction against the contention of the states, including particularly Georgia, that that provision of the Constitution was not intended to be reciprocal but was only intended to provide for a one way street of suits against a state by citizens of another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.316" offset="9850158">Very soon after that, almost immediately after the Chisholm decision, the Eleventh Amendment was passed by the Congress and ratified by the states because the Congress simply didn't agree with that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.146" offset="9933540">But significantly, the Eleventh Amendment and the Chisholm case didn't deal at all with a suit by a citizen of one state against its own state, and I think that there was never any question but that sovereign immunity existed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.258" offset="10001981">And it would be strange indeed to think that the Congress which passed the Eleventh Amendment in 1793, 1795, had any thought that in passing the Trade and Intercourse Act that the states were not immune from suits by their own citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.569" offset="10071153">So again, there is no basis for finding a waiver of immunity here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.539" offset="10095082">Finally, the other part of the waiver argument below was that this accusation was allegedly a proprietary act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.828" offset="10136251">I do not believe that that can be, the acquisition of this land by treaty in any sense properly could be viewed as proprietary, even if the state did sell it for more than it originally purchased it for, substantially more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.655" offset="10195496">But as our reply brief points out, there was a substantial amount of state legislation afterwards which at least delayed the payments, and we don't know whether the payments for this land were actually ever made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2754.546" offset="11187105">The events that gave rise to this litigation occurred during this countrys' very infancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.534" offset="11211033">During the Revolutionary War, the Oneida Indian Nation fought as this country's steadfast ally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.854" offset="11236319">As a result of that alliance, the Oneida Nations villages were burned, and the Oneidas were forced to vacate their lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.627" offset="11267457">At the conclusion of the Revolutionary War, the United States, as a show of faith and appreciation for the service of its ally, guaranteed the Oneidas the continued possession of its lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.518" offset="11315000">That guarantee appears in three federal treaties over a period of ten years: First, the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, second, the 1789 Treaty of Fort Harmar, and third, the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.046" offset="11381142">The Treaty of Canandaigua, the last of those three, still remains in force and effect between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.867" offset="11408414">In fact, the Oneidas today continue to receive annuity payments under the Treaty of Canandaigua.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.937" offset="11432656">Despite these treaty guarantees, on September 15, 1795, the State of New York purported to purchase approximately 100,000 acres of the treaty guaranteed lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.012" offset="11485005">There is no doubt in this case that that purchase was in violation of the 1793 Indian Trade and Intercourse Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.617" offset="11519382">The parties here do not dispute that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.236" offset="11529831">Neither can there be any doubt that that transaction was concluded by the state with foreknowledge that it was acting in violation of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.194" offset="11573717">The unrefuted evidence in this case establishes clearly that Governor Jay had been directly informed by then Secretary of War Pickering that in the opinion of the United States Attorney General at that time, Mr. Bradford, that the 1793 Indian Trade and Intercourse Act applied to state purchases of Indian land, and where the state purported to act without the consent of the federal government, applied to void those transactions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.680" offset="12103689">First, the cause of action issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.566" offset="12123229">It seems to me it is appropriate at this point to make two simple observations, and then I will conclude my remarks on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.737" offset="12151859">One is that we cannot construe the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.874" offset="12172443">At the time, Congress was acting against a background of clearly established federal law principles, Two of those important principles were at the time, first, that the Indian tribes had acknowledged under principles of international law exclusive rights to occupancy to their land, and secondly, that those exclusive rights of occupancy could be extinguished only by act of the Sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.423" offset="12274634">Against that background, the first Congress passed the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, and in the words of this Court in its 1974 decision, the non-intercourse act provision of that statute simply codified what was or came to be the accepted principle that Indian title could be extinguished only with the consent of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.872" offset="12368362">The non-intercourse act provision must be construed, then, as against that background, not as creating a wholly new substantive area of law or a wholly new right of the Indian tribes, but in recognizing pre-existing rights and providing for the further protection of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.952" offset="12448714">Secondly, it is important to--</text>

            <text syncTime="3082.526" offset="12498974">Primarily we rely for that proposition on the case Johnson v. M'Intosh.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.080" offset="12517260">What occurred in that case was it was essentially a property dispute between two non-Indian claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.817" offset="12544218">One of the claimants was a successor in interest to an Indian tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.455" offset="12558742">What the Court did in that case was look to these principles of international law to ascertain, first of all, what the Indian tribes' right of occupancy were to that land, and secondly, whether or not those rights could be conveyed to the non-Indian claimant in the suit without the consent of the general government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.914" offset="12628541">The Court held in that decision that it could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.766" offset="12639931">Now, we rely on those two principles as forming the basic elements of a federal common law cause of action in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.138" offset="12761452">Were there any spaces left in the development of the federal common law at that time, we think they were adequately filled by the enactment of the 1790 Indian Trade and Intercourse Act which did, in fact, on its face, purport to establish a special protection for Indian tribes, and did in fact codify the principle that Indian land could not be lost without the consent of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.919" offset="12856642">We think that clearly between the two, the principles of Johnson v. M'Intosh, and Congress with subsequent enactments of the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, that there is a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.394" offset="12906484">Now, I will turn my attention to the statute of limitations issue in an effort to respond to some of the Court's inquiries in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.416" offset="12942533">First of all, it is the position of the Respondents in this case that 28 U.S.C. Section 2415 certainly does apply, both with respect to the monetary damages aspect of these claims and the title aspect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3222.102" offset="13057367">The words "Indian tribe" do not appear in that subsection, but as Justice O'Connor observed earlier, it is clear from the language there that Congress intended there to be a statute of limitations governing money claims brought by tribes as well as the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.295" offset="13122047">That implication is clear from the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.099" offset="13137302">The statute first of all sets up a procedure by which the Secretary of the Interior can ascertain which money damages claims should be brought by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.805" offset="13176172">Those lists are to be published.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.071" offset="13185158">A second list is to be published which rejects certain claims by the Secretary as unmeritorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.475" offset="13210863">Finally, subsection (a) provides that with respect to the rejected claims, the suit must be brought within a year thereafter or be forever barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.700" offset="13251718">It is clear from both the legislative history and the statute framework itself that within that year period of time the only suits that would be filed would certainly not be by the Secretary of the Interior but by the tribes themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="3349.719" offset="13567800">Now, what we have, if Congress on the one hand establishes a parallel track between the United States and tribal claims on trespass damages, we then refer to subsection (c) which says that no statute of limitations shall bar title suits brought by the United States on behalf of Indian tribes.</text>

            <text syncTime="4289.758" offset="17327970">There is a clear record of continued activity on the part of the Oneidas to take whatever steps were available to them at the time to resolve this matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="4430.015" offset="17888976">We must begin with some determination as to the appropriate standard to be applied in ascertaining whether or not a particular act extinguished Indian title.</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.572" offset="17935160">This Court in United States v. Santa Fe Railroad laid down the appropriate rule, in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.626" offset="17959402">That rule is that Indian title can be extinguished only by the plain and unambiguous act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4453.696" offset="17983748">Even the Petitioners do not assert that the facts they rely on constitute plain and unambiguous ratification of the 1795 transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.421" offset="18030559">So assuming for the moment that the Petitioners are correct as to the proper standard to apply, they still have not met the burden of proof in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4475.776" offset="18072042">Even if we apply the so-called explicit ratification, explicit acknowledgement and implicit ratification standard that the Petitioners seek, we find their evidence lacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.251" offset="18117913">Essentially, what happened is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4489.453" offset="18126690">In 1798 another transaction occurred between the Oneida Nation and the State of New York.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="5137.355" offset="20718350">Yes, and it was his remarks that the Court quoted from in the 1974 Oneida opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.493" offset="20742905">In fact, this paragraph was between the two, the two portions of his remarks that the Court relied upon in Oneida, one in saying that the New York Indians should have a right to go into federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.134" offset="20785433">If I could go back even further, and this also ties in to a question that Justice Rehnquist had in an earlier time about what would happen if the Oneidas went into state court, and in this regard, it is useful to lock at the case of Seneca Nation v. Christy in 162 U.S. and the underlying state court decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.897" offset="20872473">The first aspect of the case that is important for this point is the fact that it was a cause of action to invalidate a transaction under the Trade and Intercourse Act by an Indian tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="5186.605" offset="20915313">It failed for other reasons in state court, but the New York Court of Appeals and the lower court never suggested that an Indian tribe didn't have a right to invoke the Trade and Intercourse Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.061" offset="20957109">What the court, the State Court dismissed the claim for failure to comply with the state statute of limitations, and this Court declined to review it on the ground that there was no separate federal question involved, on the ground that the state had furnished the Indian tribe a special state statutory remedy, and that the tribe had to comply with the procedures under that special remedy, which was the application of the state statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5220.592" offset="21051255">But even the New York Court of Appeals was careful to point out the question is not whether an Indian title can be barred by adverse possession or by state statutes of limitation; the point is that the Plaintiff cannot invoke the special remedy given by statute without being bound by the conditions upon which it is given.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.788" offset="21116038">So this is a decision by the New York Court of Appeals itself in 1891 recognizing that to apply state law to wholly bar the claim would be inappropriate, but that state law applied because the state had furnished a special remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5252.380" offset="21178419">So we have a continuing understanding that Indian, that statutes of limitation do not apply to claims brought by Indians, and in fact, if one looks at the text of the Trade and Intercourse Acts from 1790 onward, they, too, furnish a compelling indication that Congress would not have intended state statutes of limitation to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.461" offset="21258771">They say that no transaction or title or claim to Indian property shall be of any validity in law or equity, strongly suggesting that for a court to apply a statute of limitations or laches where Congress had not specified would be inconsistent with the purpose of voiding such transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5293.124" offset="21341423">In fact, where Congress has intended to apply state statutes of limitation to Indian claims, it has done so expressly; for example, in 25 U.S.C. 347, which deals with claims for allotments, Congress has expressly applied state statutes of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.984" offset="21408819">And finally, under this Court's analysis in DelCostello of last term, it seems quite clear that the appropriate analogy for the statute of limitations in this area is to refer to federal law, to which the trustee would be bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="5326.596" offset="21475274">I would like to make two other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.012" offset="21480917">One, we do believe the Congress can extinguish, Justice White, the title in this area simply by ratifying the transaction as it had the right to do in 1795.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.569" offset="21523235">And lastly--</text>

            <text syncTime="5341.221" offset="21533789">I was just raising a question of whether it ever would.</text>

            <text syncTime="5343.907" offset="21544551">--Well, Congress has shown a readiness to extinguish these claims when the parties come into agreement, and if there was going to be widespread disarrangement in New York State because of these claims, I think that Congress could be expected to act.</text>

            <text syncTime="5359.367" offset="21606409">Under our reading, Congress would have to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5362.852" offset="21620306">With respect to the equitable claims in the case, we do not suggest at this point that laches would actually entirely bar the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5369.874" offset="21648414">Our analysis was directed at some considerations that should be taken into account in future claims against private landowners, particularly, and in fact, if applied in this case, we think there is some chance that even the damage award that would be applied in this particular case would not be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="5390.186" offset="21729707">One last point I would like to make, that in these cases, although Petitioners tend to paint with broad brush with respect to eastern land claims, in fact, the process of resolving them has turned out to be fairly orderly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5402.244" offset="21777877">In many cases there is a specific basis on which the claim can be found to have been extinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.898" offset="21800551">In this case we have discussed in our brief the Treaty of Buffalo Creek and the subsequent litigation in New York Indians v. United States, which may provide a basis for finding that the claim was extinguished without resorting to statutes of limitation.</text>
