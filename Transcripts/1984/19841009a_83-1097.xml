            <text syncTime="763.988" offset="3179661">To return for a moment to the 1981 statute and why it is we believe... and why the Secretary concluded that the mandatory withholdings must be included within the $75 cap, Congress did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.645" offset="3238279">First, it removed the reasonably attributable work expenses provision in 402(a)(7).</text>
            <text syncTime="785.567" offset="3265969">Prior to 1981, this Court had decided in Shea versus Vialpando that that provision referred to all expenses, subject only to a reasonableness limitation that could be attributable to income.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.292" offset="3312885">Every state recognized that those expenses would also include mandatory payroll withholdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.946" offset="3335455">When Congress took that provision and added it to 402(a)(8), the inference seems to me inescapable that Congress intended to include the mandatory withholdings within that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.420" offset="3381430">But any doubt on that question seems to me to have been resolved because Congress added the work disregard to earned income, and earned income also had been well established prior to the 1981 enactment as meaning gross wages, and therefore Congress called for the disregard to come from gross wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.482" offset="3453633">Accordingly, the two, the combination of the treatment of 402(a)(7) and 402(a)(9) seems to me clearly to require the conclusion that mandatory withholdings must be within the... were always intended in 1981 as within the mandatory... or within the $75 disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.859" offset="3531164">That also comports well with the policy of the 1981 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.163" offset="3548301">First Congress intended to standardize this process to avoid any kind of arithmetical errors or potential abuse, and clearly a $75 standard disregard eliminates any kind of problems that might otherwise arise in case of handling specific individualized tax items.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.190" offset="3616428">Congress eliminated that by including only $75 as the cap.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.760" offset="3634714">In addition, Congress meant to save some money by including a $75 cap that was below the national average.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.997" offset="3663657">In order to assure that work expenses are below the national average of $75, one has to include mandatory payroll withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.353" offset="3697094">That is the force of the McMann affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.388" offset="3709215">If you exclude those mandatory withholdings, then the national average drops below $75, which would mean that this provision was in effect a bonus for the recipients instead of a cut, as Congress clearly intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.029" offset="3763863">Thus in our view there is no way to read the action of the Congress in 1981 in terms of its statutory history and in terms of its policy of the Act in any way but to endorse the Secretary's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.705" offset="3818511">For reasons that I think are even clearer, and that I have already discussed, the 1984 amendments essentially ratified the Secretary's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.811" offset="3854978">There is a live controversy as to that, and that issue then can be disposed of readily, and we ask the Court to do so.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark N. Aaronson</label>
            <text syncTime="995.135" offset="4104291">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the dispute before the Court today concerns the effects of what Congress did in 1981 or the AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.341" offset="4145042">It is, as the Court acknowledges, new legislation was enacted in 1984, and it is our reading of that new legislation that it evidences for the first time a Congressional intent supportive of the HHS Secretary's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.469" offset="4217558">I think the record regarding the 1984 enactment is in sharp contrast to the record regarding 1981, and we think the prospective applicability of the 1984 enactment is one which courts will have to consider, and will have to consider below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.228" offset="4280565">It is not the dispute before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.264" offset="4288715">What this Court has to weigh is any information that can be gleaned from the 1984 record about the intent of Congress in 1981, but it will not override the intent of Congress in 1981 as this Court can determine from the legislative record at that time and the language at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.726" offset="4362590">In this regard, I think what is very striking is to look at the reasons Congress was given for enacting the work expense disregard in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.597" offset="4402087">Secretary Schweikert, the predecessor to the current Secretary, who is the petitioner in this case, at the hearings held before the Public Assistance Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee indicated that a principal reason for the work expense disregard was to provide an incentive for AFDC recipients to find the most economical way to meet their work expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.780" offset="4490799">As we have shown in our briefs, the average work expenses for a working recipient in California prior to the '81 enactment was $83.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.517" offset="4525803">A recipient working full-time at the minimum wage in the typical AFDC household would have had withheld for payroll taxes, the basic core payroll taxes, at least $75.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.609" offset="4574181">If that is the case, the idea of having a $75 work expense disregard that would allow recipients to take some measures to economize on their expenses is a meaningless provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.982" offset="4619634">That disregard would be eaten up entirely by the mandatory withholdings over which recipients have absolutely no control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.671" offset="4654430">Secondly, in terms of the statement of reasons for this particular provision, not for some of the other provisions that were enacted during the 1981 legislative session, was given by the Senate Budget Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.312" offset="4700928">The Senate Budget Committee listed three reasons, and we have cited these in our brief: one, that there was great variation among the states in dealing with work expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.084" offset="4736036">The record in this case is clear that there was no variation with respect to mandatory payroll taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.674" offset="4762368">Every state gave recipients a credit for those expenses, and it did not count against them in determining their eligibility or benefit levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.530" offset="4797790">Second, there was a problem of administrative complexity and opportunities for error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.665" offset="4818374">There is almost no problem of administrative complexity and opportunity for error with respect to payroll tax withholdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.236" offset="4844601">Recipients must submit each month their payroll stubs, and eligibility workers and state welfare departments take from those payroll stubs the exact amount of withholdings that an employer has subtracted from the gross income of recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.180" offset="4908444">And third, there was a concern for abuse by recipients in claiming work expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.501" offset="4929656">Again, as the courts below in this case have indicated, this notion of withholding taxes is a paradigmatic example of the kinds of items that are not subject to abuse and fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.165" offset="5016382">Yes, but there is a provision and have been provisions in almost every state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.199" offset="5032474">In California, for example, recipients were required to declare the number of dependents that they actually have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.870" offset="5059223">They had no option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.138" offset="5064239">It was written as part of the administrative regulation governing the calculation of grants, so that--</text>

            <text syncTime="1240.607" offset="5086077">But it is still subject to abuse, if somebody asserts ten, and he has only three.</text>

            <text syncTime="1244.661" offset="5102377">--It is subject to very easy verification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.446" offset="5117528">You get on AFDC because you have children eligible for the grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.017" offset="5135814">Your dependents are going to typically be your children and yourself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.719" offset="5154622">If it happens to be a two-parent household, there will be four parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.921" offset="5167370">It is really very easy to verify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.956" offset="5175520">There was an absolute requirement that recipients not have any opportunity to vary, take advantage of the tax laws, if you will, and declare either fewer or more dependents.</text>

            <label>Justice Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="1272.661" offset="5214390">Then the Tax Court cases that struggle over the issue of whether a dependent is assertable are of no significance?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_n_aaronson" startTime="1280.084" stopTime="1722.436">
            <label>Mr. Mark N. Aaronson</label>
            <text syncTime="1280.084" offset="5244065">Not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.101" offset="5248141">This provision... the AFDC households would be governed in terms of declaring dependents for AFDC purposes by the number of dependents they actually have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.142" offset="5288265">Now, I think the purpose behind the work expense disregard is illustrated by one of our class representatives in this case, Ms. Kathryn Bass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.765" offset="5330792">She had each month $84 of withholding taxes taken from her paycheck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.568" offset="5350018">She also declared, not counting her child care expenses, $180 in cut of pocket work expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.238" offset="5376663">Under the new provision, she is forced to economize on those $180 in work expenses, and will have to get them down to $75.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.661" offset="5410309">That is what the new law required of her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.613" offset="5422116">In terms of directly addressing, if one looks in the legislative record, and looks at statements of officials or Congressional representatives, there is absolutely no reference to taxes at all in the 1981 legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.088" offset="5472062">There appeared to be no concern, no focus by Congress on this particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.492" offset="5493692">This comes up as an issue precisely after litigation is brought challenging the federal government's interpretation of this provision, and the 1984 enactment is enacted in response to HHS bringing that litigation to the attention of Congress, and it is, I think, striking to compare Congress's attention to this issue in 1984 with its total lack of attention to the issue in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.142" offset="5608317">Now, the real heart of the problem in this case is an historical interpretation that has been endorsed by this Court, that has been ratified by Congress on several occasions, of the meaning of what is termed the income and resources clause of Section 402(a)(7)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.854" offset="5671115">That is at the very first part of that section of the Social Security Act, and it has not been amended since its original enactment in any significant way in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.127" offset="5712180">It was reenacted in 1962, when Congress first enacted a mandatory work expense provision to take into account the problems of out of pocket work expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.232" offset="5752617">It was reenacted in 1967-68, when Congress again amended these provisions, and it was reenacted even a third time in 1981, again, without modification, and it is that provision which the lower courts have relied on and the long-standing administrative interpretation, legislatively and judicially endorsed interpretation that that provision requires recipients only to take into account what is called actually available income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.602" offset="5866093">And we have submitted in the record, and you will find in the joint appendix the 1940's Social Security Board statements which require the states in administering the AFDC program at that time consistent with the intent of Congress as expressed in 1939 to take into account only income that is in hand, that is readily available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.998" offset="5947700">That particular... those particular statements are the predecessors of the current AFDC provision in the regulations that requires that only income actually available be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.989" offset="5995661">In 1962, when Congress enacted the reasonable expense provision, the Secretary contends that that was also intended to cover mandatory tax withholdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.047" offset="6047905">It is again, as in 1981, striking that there is absolutely no reference whatsoever in the 1962 legislative record, in the administrative guidelines that were proposed before, in the implementing administrative regulations that were enacted after that in any way referenced tax withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.460" offset="6129512">HEW and Congress in 1962 was dealing with the problem that states were not consistently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.928" offset="6151455">They were urged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.714" offset="6154590">It was optional for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.097" offset="6160128">They were not consistently taking into account the out of pocket expenses individuals have for transportation, for lunches, for meals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.255" offset="6204745">They in no way were talking about taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.289" offset="6216865">It just hasn't come up as an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.408" offset="6225329">It is also evidence, as we have submitted in the record and you will find in your joint appendix, that prior to that enactment, HEW commissioned a report, and that report very clearly says that the states were considering as the income available to the household if there were earners in the household their take-home pay as the starting point, and from their take-home pay they then urged the states on an optional basis to subtract the kind of discretionary expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.178" offset="6348418">Congress knows how, Congress knows how to make exceptions to the actually available income principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.652" offset="6390319">They did it in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.285" offset="6396797">They did it on behalf of income from stepfathers that were residing in AFDC homes, thereby superceding in terms of the precise issue a case of this Court, Lewis v. Martin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.376" offset="6445176">They also deemed available moneys from the earned income tax credit, an action they undid in 1984, and they also deemed available very explicitly actions from sponsors of aliens who might have come here as being moneys available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.522" offset="6513825">Prior to the 1981 legislation, Congress had a number of bills concerning this precise issue, work expenses, and also the problem which is not part of this case, of the computation of the work incentive disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.512" offset="6569728">A very important bill was H.R. 4904.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.881" offset="6583207">In that bill, they did something very specific that was not done in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.685" offset="6602433">They amended the definition of income in the income and resources clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.255" offset="6620719">They in fact repealed the notion of actually available income and very specifically in the statute qualified the definition of income by reference to another provision that very carefully listed what income was to be included and what income was to be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.182" offset="6680382">They then established, as part of Section 402(a), a set of disregards that were more liberal than those finally enacted, and that were intended to roughly keep recipients in the same place as they had been before in terms of the subtraction of various deductions and out of pocket expenses and also continue to provide for the kind of work incentive disregard that existed before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.801" offset="6802949">Congress knows how.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.351" offset="6809114">It showed again, not as directly, I must say, but I think there certainly is evidence in the Congressional reports in 1984 that it can create an exception, but our contention has been, and I think one fully supported and very well reasoned by the Courts below that they did not do that in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.678" offset="6878390">They were not concerned with this particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.249" offset="6896676">Now, we have raised in our briefing the question of whether given the 1984 legislation this should be a case before this Court, not because the 1984 provision applies retrospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.326" offset="6952996">I do not think that is the case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.028" offset="6963863">But that it now does provide prospectively, and our assumption has been that the Court accepted the cert petition in this case because there was a conflict among the circuits, and there was likely to continue to be a conflict among the circuits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1758.442" offset="7157483">And it may well not have reached the same conclusion that it did reach when it was presented with a case where it was a continuing vital issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1797.050" offset="7311919">And in this particular case, given this Court's holding in Edelman v.

            <text syncTime="2186.517" offset="8869757">The difficulty is, they didn't directly amend Section 402(a)(7), but they added a new section to Section 402(a)(8), read in conjunction with the legislative report, I think, can be shown to have for the first time evidenced their intent to create an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.728" offset="8942586">Now, I think what was really going on in 1981, and what was of primary concern to Congress was ending certain financial incentives that existed for working recipients, and those have to do with this work incentive disregard that is not at issue in this case, and reversing how it is computed, fixing certain limits on its availability to four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.164" offset="9060346">They were also concerned about certain high earners being on welfare, so they established a flat amount, a flat limit on eligibility, what is called the 150 percent rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.703" offset="9102560">They were concerned about the higher earners being on welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.440" offset="9125443">What they were not concerned, what they didn't express other than in a general concern for simplifying administration and dealing with a certain problem of abuse, was to put recipients in a worse position because they are working.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.481" offset="9169643">And the interpretation of the 1981 provision does precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.921" offset="9199422">In 1984, Congress enacted some provisions that modified the harshness of that impact at the same time they enacted the definition of earned income, so that the provision operating prospectively will not be as harsh on working recipients as it is in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.882" offset="9271207">In essence, what the Congress was doing in 1981 with respect to this issue was superseding this Court's decision in Shea versus Vialpando.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.838" offset="9315092">Shea did not address the mandatory payroll deduction issue at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.225" offset="9332647">What was at issue was Colorado's provision for applying a flat $30 work expense disregard for transportation and other out of pocket expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.498" offset="9373711">It didn't cover child care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.033" offset="9379876">It didn't cover tax withholdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.235" offset="9388653">This Court did not address the statutory basis on which states may have been taking into account individually tax withholdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.239" offset="9420627">In 1981, Congress enacts the $75 work expense disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.206" offset="9440480">They enact a separate provision for child care, and they don't address taxes at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.276" offset="9464826">What Congress was doing is saying what this Court said it could not do under the 1962 legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.412" offset="9485306">They are saying you can't establish an absolute limit, have an absolute standard on work expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.001" offset="9511742">Basically, what has happened in this case, after Congress enacted, without the HHS Secretary in any way informing Congress ahead of time, at least from what is evident in the record that one can find, the HHS Secretary decided to bootstrap the notion of including mandatory payroll taxes within $75 work expense disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.764" offset="9598782">And what one sees afterwards and one sees in the briefs is a post facto rationalization of that administrative decision by HHS, an administrative decision that is impermissible, that involves an impermissible construction at the time of Section 402(a)(7)(A) because it would result in a conflict with the over 40-year history of using only actually available income.</text>

            <text syncTime="2400.318" offset="9725006">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, just a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.039" offset="9747889">Basically, we would like to make two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.739" offset="9754681">One, in response to respondent's contention concerning the actually available income principle, and then second, I would like to make a few comments concerning the 1984 legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.912" offset="9791357">Respondents contend that this Court should basically disregard everything that Congress had before it in 1981 when it amended Sections 402(a)(7) and (8), and instead think back into the 1940's and 1950's to practices that were never part of any of the statute or the regulations that would expressly incorporate the kind of actually available income doctrine that respondents argue for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.895" offset="9891249">Respondents basically say that actually available income must refer to take-home pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.363" offset="9913192">Congress has never defined income to refer to take-home pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.751" offset="9926671">No legislative history of Congress has ever defined income to refer to take-home pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.119" offset="9948196">No regulations or instructions of either HEW or HHS has ever referred to income as take-home pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.909" offset="9979334">Indeed, the Ninth Circuit in this case did not even adopt the theory that income is take-home pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.415" offset="10009323">It recognized that some withholdings could properly be included within the standard disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.549" offset="10029907">There is simply no authoritative source for the notion that actually available income is take-home pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.686" offset="10054462">What is much more reasonable to conclude is that this is in fact actually available income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.424" offset="10073375">It is moneys paid directly from the employer to the employee, and are immediately used for certain expenses that the employee must incur by virtue of having worked, and that is exactly what work expense disregards would presumably embrace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.517" offset="10133770">Accordingly, in our view, the actually available income concept is simply too weak to sustain the burden of respondent's submission in this case, especially in light of the notion that Congress had a different administrative practice to which it was responding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.876" offset="10195210">With regard to the effect of the 1984 legislation, it seems to me respondents suggested a couple of alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.197" offset="10220496">The worst of those is that the Court should dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.251" offset="10236692">In that event, the state will immediately become liable for $20 million in retroactive benefits prior to the time of the permanent injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.107" offset="10276085">Moreover, presumably the injunction of the District Court will now be reinstated in that event, and therefore prospectively the statute will now be interpreted in a way consistent with respondent's theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.265" offset="10324777">It makes no sense to force HHS and the state to incur those kinds of liabilities in a situation where the Ninth Circuit's decision is manifestly inconsistent with Congress's intent, certainly in 1984, and under our theory in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.690" offset="10386426">The alternative, of course, is to simply vacate and remand, and while we suggested that that is a possible alternative in our reply brief, it seems to us to make much more sense that since there are a lot of cases out there with differing results and in differing stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.802" offset="10446926">And this issue is properly presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.652" offset="10454345">The legislative history is unambiguous that the Court should simply decide that issue, and should decide it not on the basis that the 1984 legislation should be presumed to apply retroactively, but rather to recognize that the 1984 legislation ratified the Secretary's understanding of the proper approach to the 1981 statute, and by so doing, the Court would, of course, reverse the judgment below.</text>
