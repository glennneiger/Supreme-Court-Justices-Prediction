            <text syncTime="82.405" offset="451415">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="85.545" offset="463954">At issue in this case is the extent to which a state, by application of state law, may regulate the legal obligations of parties to a collective bargaining agreement and adjudicate the legal consequences of the breach of such agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.285" offset="538977">A majority of the Wisconsin supreme court held that Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 did not preempt a state court suit brought by a union employee against his employer, alleging tortious bad faith in the administrative handling of a disability claim, even though the employee's right to benefits derived entirely from a collective bargaining agreement, and the employee did not resort to the contractual grievance procedure which included arbitration at the terminal level.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.958" offset="689652">The facts are simple and undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.925" offset="709505">Allis-Chalmers and the UAW union for many years have been parties to collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.111" offset="734269">The current agreement at issue here incorporates a group health and disability plan funded by Allis-Chalmers and administered by Aetna Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.105" offset="786200">Disability benefits are provided for non-occupational illness and injury to all UAW represented employees, including Lueck.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.914" offset="829459">The agreement between the UAW and Allis-Chalmers also contains a provision for resolution of disputes, as I have noted earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.501" offset="879823">It's a typical union contract dispute resolution procedure, grievance procedure, culminating in arbitration at the final level.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.779" offset="920887">Lueck suffered a nonwork-related disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.558" offset="940009">Payments were initiated under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.244" offset="958817">Lueck ultimately received all that was due him under the plan, but there was some delay in payment with respect to some of the obligation under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.254" offset="1014824">Lueck did not go to his union.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.236" offset="1026736">He did not go to the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.236" offset="1038752">What he did do was to go to the circuit court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin and file a lawsuit against Allis-Chalmers alleging contemptuous, deliberate, repeated conduct on the part of the company in failing to pay... make payments promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.805" offset="1117015">He further alleged that as as result of the defendant's bad faith, he incurred emotional distress, pain and suffering, physical impairment, all to his damages to the extent of $10,000 compensatory and $300,000 punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.550" offset="1180022">With respect to the circuit court suit, Allis-Chalmers and Aetna raised two defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.360" offset="1207294">First, that the suit was preempted by Section 301 of the labor Management Relations Act; and secondly, that Lueck had not resorted to the contractual grievance procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="298.505" offset="1315859">The reason I say the record does not show it, the case went up on summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.017" offset="1345847">And I was about to come to that motion for summary judgment on the failure to exhaust the grievance procedure and on account of preemption under 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.732" offset="1384718">The circuit court granted motion for summary judgment on behalf of both defendants Allis-Chalmers and Aetna.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.792" offset="1417005">An appeal was taken to the Wisconsin court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.648" offset="1436440">It affirmed the lower court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.976" offset="1441665">And further appealed to the Wisconsin supreme court with respect to certiorari, to wit we're here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.677" offset="1472489">A majority of that court in January of last year, relying on what it said were long-established principles of state insurance law, held that any violation of the labor agreement was irrelevant to the issue of bad faith handling of the disability claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.150" offset="1562350">Further, the court said there was no 301 presumption</text>
            <text syncTime="366.039" offset="1585965">"even though the insurance contract is part of a labor agreement otherwise governed by federal law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="372.209" offset="1610625">By implication, the court further held that there was no need to resort to the grievance procedure because it did not comment on the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.565" offset="1656078">The single dissent in the Wisconsin supreme court concluded that any duty allegedly violated by Allis-Chalmers was specifically created by the labor contract and would not exist absent the labor contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.369" offset="1727235">Consequently, the dissent concluded, it must fail within... on account of the ambit of Section 301 which governs labor agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.365" offset="1771225">The dissent further noted that there should have been an exhaustion of remedies under the grievance procedure which did not occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.065" offset="1810096">Finally, the dissent concluded that the mere existence of a state tort of bad faith is insufficient to override uniformity in application of federal labor law, and to do as the majority holds fragments federal labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.587" offset="1892120">I have gone into some detail here on what happened in the court below because I think that puts into sharp focus precisely the issues before you here this afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.613" offset="1944261">We respectfully submit that this is a 301 case, pure and simple... a labor agreement, grievance procedure, arbitration at the terminal level, no attempt to grieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.028" offset="2005910">Since the enactment of LMBA in 1947 and beginning with the first significant decision in that area in 1957, the Lincoln Mills case, and continuing through the Steelworkers trilogy in 1950, Boys Market in 1957, I believe, the law has consistently held that it's federal law that must be fashioned by the courts, federal law and not state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.279" offset="2162958">And yet, the result of the supreme court decision of Wisconsin here would fragment that federal law and permit encroachment on the exclusivity that is created under LMBA and under the decided cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.926" offset="2237459">With respect to the preemption aspect, we suggest also that the law is crystal clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.328" offset="2291062">In Lucas Flower in 1962 the Court first articulated the concept of preemption of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.167" offset="2330455">This has been applied consistently and without exception over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.383" offset="2363369">The erosion that would result from acceptance of the Wisconsin doctrine would be... would have very serious implications on the federal labor scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.768" offset="2412897">In that respect I think it is appropriate for me to note the cogent amicus brief filed by the AFL-CIO and a similar brief by the United States Chamber of Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.044" offset="2465978">These briefs state in some detail their view as to what would result if state action could be accorded the kind of finality that would apply under the Wisconsin decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.428" offset="2527523">The issue is simple: does Wisconsin as a state have the right to impose insurance principles in the context of a collective bargaining agreement governed by federal law with arbitration in the grievance procedure also included in that contract, and which--</text>

            <text syncTime="2017.873" offset="8193273">--But they're making the final decision as to whether or not we're going to refer it back to the labor agreement, Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.324" offset="8215111">And, in addition... well, 42, page 42, that letter again shows that it only deals with disability benefits and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.898" offset="8257430">So, again, we would be consistent with what they're saying here, that we'd be going through the labor agreement in respect to discontinuance of weekly disability benefits, and that's it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.864" offset="8297240">If I may make a suggestion to the Court, I think the Court, at least as far as the philosophy is concerned, has addressed this question in respect to the Garman preemption situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.687" offset="8352515">A short note: the Garman preemption arguments as presented by myself were originally brought up in the circuit court and determined by Justice Lamponi in the circuit court on the two grounds: one, Section 301 preemption; and number two, on the basis of Garman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.350" offset="8427225">That argument was brought all the way through the Wisconsin courts, and that's why the Wisconsin court relied heavily on the Garman argument, primarily because it was raised by opposing counsel and Allis-Chalmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.142" offset="8486367">I'd like to bring out just two points as far as the Garman preemptions considerations are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.825" offset="8513116">The Court did appear hard-pressed when they talked about, say, emotional distress in the Farmer decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.120" offset="8538298">In other words, it appeared to me as reading the decision that the Court wanted to make perfectly clear that as far as the emotional distress situation is concerned, that that would have to be something completely separate out of this wage and conditions of employment argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.911" offset="8605485">That the... the... we have to... we have to look at the type of conduct that was promulgated by the tort feasor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.281" offset="8646967">In other words, in that case it was my understanding that the emotional distress was a function of the particularly abusive manner in which the claimant was handled by the union officials, and that the matters dealing with the negotiation of the contract or the rates under the contract were completely separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.225" offset="8738710">And you can see, at least from my reading of it, it seems that this Court has attempted to distinguish that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.956" offset="8769638">That's basically all that Mr. Lueck is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.439" offset="8779565">He's attempting to show that there was a particularly abusive manner in which he was treated that's separate and distinct from the labor contract, and that yes, he can go through the remedies that are afforded by the labor contract, and yes, he can go into state court and go after that separate tort and the remedies that are available there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.884" offset="8861381">The dual functions are served.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.148" offset="8870367">The Section 301 is remaining intact, and the state interest in making sure that insurance companies don't horse an individual around are also remain intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.472" offset="8915715">They can go hand in hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.815" offset="8921044">They do not necessarily butt heads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.612" offset="8928254">Another argument as far as the Garman philosophy is concerned is that the Section 301 preemption argument is incorporated in the Garman exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.091" offset="8974125">Number one, the number one criteria where it talks of whether or not the action is one of peripheral concern to the Labor Management Relations Act, that directly goes to Section 301 considerations, whether or not Section 301 applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.567" offset="9056045">The Wisconsin court saw the tort as separate and distinct and that it did not infringe on the Section 301 rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.924" offset="9089482">And as a result, he's able to bring that state court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.422" offset="9107454">And again, the whole situation, it accommodates, it accommodates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.638" offset="9132323">Mr. Lueck's action accommodates both the state interest and the federal interest under 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.167" offset="9154474">The decision of the Wisconsin supreme court noted that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.229" offset="9166700">They paid due deference to the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.275" offset="9178925">They're just saying that he's proceeding on a different... he's proceeding on a different track.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.475" offset="9195748">He's trying to get some recovery and redress, something that you're entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.520" offset="9215914">He's trying to get the redress for... for the abusive manner he was treated in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.236" offset="9234723">Now, I know that the ERISA argument as posed by Justice Day is going to probably depend on how the decisions come out on the case that was previous to this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.073" offset="9310060">However, I'd like to note again that there is a federal policy, at least as we stand now, that the federal policy that's put in the McCarran-Ferguson Act clearly shows that there should be no preemption here of the state right to regulate the insurance activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.924" offset="9385501">The situation that we have here is pretty much like what happened... the provisions in the labor agreement, as far as the insurance benefits are concerned, the insurance portion of the brief, of the contract, indicates that Allis-Chalmers had a choice of whether or not to self-insure or whether or not to hire somebody, an insurance company, to insure them and that type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.819" offset="9509113">Now, the question I'd pose to the Court is what would happen if Allis-Chalmers in this case allowed another insurance company to insure the disability plan; rather than Allis-Chalmers being self-insured, they hired another company, and they paid premiums to that company for those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.139" offset="9586331">If the argument of opposing counsel remains consistent, apparently that insurance company can claim the exemption for the same reason that they're claiming it now; that they are not amenable to any state regulation; that it's a Section 301 situation; and that if the insurance company doesn't pay, we'll go through the arbitration process and determine whether or not they have an obligation to pay in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.486" offset="9699702">They have now... the insurance company has now been able to avoid any liability by attaching itself to Allis-Chalmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.357" offset="9739199">In big letters in my argument I basically would like to show the Court is a distinguishing case as far as Section 301 is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.760" offset="9776816">The employer has changed hats.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.352" offset="9787160">They are providing for insurance benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.992" offset="9801789">They've taken a self-insured position, and now they're claiming an immunity because of that self-insured position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.005" offset="9825821">And in addition to that, I guess that immunity would go to anybody they'd hire, because the labor agreement provides for that type of benefit, and therefore, anybody they hire or anybody that does anything in respect to that insurance is going to be immune from the type of action that Mr. Lueck has brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.825" offset="9897083">He has nowhere to go, and to not allow him to go anywhere I think steps on a state decision, a majority decision, that can accommodate the vague statements as far as Section 301 is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.537" offset="9975973">It's for actions arising out of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.021" offset="9985900">Wisconsin says it has... this does not arise out of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.440" offset="10003558">It's a separate and distinct tort.</text>
