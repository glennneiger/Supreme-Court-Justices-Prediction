            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="44.936" offset="320676">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="51.027" offset="345023">Two years ago in Bell v. New Jersey, this court unanimously held that the federal government may recoup misspent grant funds under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.317" offset="402178">The two cases that the Court will hear this afternoon involve Court of Appeals decisions announcing erroneous rules of construction that substantially frustrate the exercise of this recoupment remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.625" offset="451393">In this case, the Kentucky case, the Sixth Circuit has held that misspent grant funds may be recovered only when the violation is so plain that the grantee could not reasonably have believed that its expenditures were lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.900" offset="512520">In our view there is no legal basis for this ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.274" offset="525999">Now, as the Court is aware, Congress passed the Title I statute in 1965 for the purpose of expanding and improving programs designed to meet the special educational needs of educationally deprived children in low income areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.455" offset="582737">Now, from the outset, the Title I program has been designed to provide supplemental federal educational aid to these educationally deprived children over and above whatever assistance they would be entitled to receive from state and local funds, and in order to ensure that federal monies are used solely for this purpose, the Title I program has always included since 1965 the so-called supplanting prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.789" offset="696108">Now, this provision expressly states that Title I funds may be used only to supplement the level of funds that would in the absence of Title I be made available from state and local sources for the education of children participating in the Title I program.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.655" offset="771550">In other words, Title I is designed to provide an additional layer of federal benefits for certain educationally deprived children rather than to take the place of any money that the state or local government would otherwise provide for educating these children.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.790" offset="836020">The antisupplanting requirement has always been at the heart of the Title I program, and it has always been an express condition on the receipt of federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.412" offset="870502">Now, this case involves the way in which Kentucky operated its so-called readiness programs in 1974 under Title I.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.891" offset="908432">These readiness classes were for children who were not prepared to enter the regular first or second grade because of educational difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.169" offset="945630">And in states other than Kentucky, Title I programs provided children such as these with federally funded supplemental instruction in addition to whatever state-funded instruction they were entitled to receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.242" offset="997875">But what Kentucky did was the following: it set up special self-contained full day classes for these educationally deprived children wholly apart from the regular instructional program, and it funded these classes almost exclusively out of federal Title I funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.110" offset="1069346">In other words, these students received virtually their entire academic instruction for the first and second grade through the Title I program rather than through the regular state-funded school program.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.322" offset="1122218">As a result, it is quite obvious that Kentucky was using federal funds to supplant state and local funds that otherwise would have been available for the children in these readiness classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.444" offset="1166730">And the readiness classes unquestionably took the place of the regular first and second grade classes that these students would have attended in the absence of the Title I program.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.095" offset="1209258">And in fact, nearly half of the students in these readiness classes were actually promoted to the second or third grade after they had completed their year of readiness training.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.247" offset="1253875">So it is quite clear that at least as to those students, federal funds were being used for regular rather than supplemental instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.072" offset="1277176">Now, when federal auditors examined the Kentucky Title I program for 1974, they concluded not surprisingly that a supplanting violation had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.069" offset="1321166">Kentucky challenged this finding before the Education Appeal Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.817" offset="1336213">Now, Kentucky conceded that virtually no state and local funds had been spent for the basic instructional costs of the Title I children in the readiness classes, but it argued that a supplanting violation nonetheless had not occurred because there had been no decrease in state and local funds for the schools involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.184" offset="1413640">Now, this argument was rejected by the auditors, by the Education Appeal Board, and by the Secretary of Education, all of whom concluded that the antisupplanting provisions of the statute and regulations were crystal clear in their emphasis on maintaining state and local funds for the particular Title I children rather than simply for particular schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.099" offset="1497336">But as I mentioned a moment ago, the Sixth Circuit reversed the recoupment order.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.346" offset="1518338">The Court of Appeals agreed actually with the Secretary's reading of the antisupplanting provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.874" offset="1540386">The Sixth Circuit specifically held that the prohibition against supplanting state and local funds with federal funds could be read to refer to expenditures at the level of the educationally deprived child rather than at the school level, and it therefore held that the Secretary's reasonable interpretation of the supplanting provisions would govern all future Title I grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.507" offset="1626903">But the Court then went on to say that Kentucky's interpretation of the supplanting prohibition also was reasonable, and in these circumstances the Court held that the Secretary could not recoup the concededly misspent funds because the statutory and regulatory provisions at issue were not sufficiently clear to apprise the state of its responsibilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2715.202" offset="11001728">But again, we are looking at a contract here in the nature of a grant in aid program, in the nature of the cooperative federalism where the state is giving up something, giving up rights that it has in order to enter into that cooperation with the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.615" offset="11075393">We believe that in order to do that... and we did think consistent with Pennhurst, and that Pennhurst is very much applicable in this case, as the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals believed, that if there is going to be that giving up, then there is going to have to be a clear understanding of what it is that the state is giving up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.874" offset="11148432">To that extent, we do believe that the Court's consideration that there had not been any finding of bad faith is very much a part of the standard of review that the Courts of Appeals are to exercise pursuant to this Court's decision in Bell v.

            <text syncTime="2880.541" offset="11663044">It was a matter that was made reference to by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, to the fact that when the auditors made the exception, they made the exception only for the children that were going to be promoted and not for those children that were going to be held back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.424" offset="11726574">We believe that that tends to indicate that there were differing levels of understanding even by the auditors and the education appeals board as to what was meant by supplanting, and that it was not just our perhaps reading of the law, but it was also the reading of the law by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.010" offset="11808912">That ambiguity that we do believe existed both facially and application, can be seen in the fact that, one, it is in the NIE report that there was a lack of clarity in the issue of supplanting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.801" offset="11872128">This ambiguity, the unclearness of the understanding as to what was supplanting, existed even after 1977, or 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.327" offset="11918208">It went on even through 1977, and that again is in the NIE report that that had been very much an issue in the Office of Education between various members of that office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.431" offset="11982678">So we have a continuation even past the period of our audit when there was still some problems as to what was meant by supplanting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.332" offset="12022280">The supplanting statute certainly stated a goal, but we argue that it did not explain how that goal was going to be achieved and was going to be gained, and we do believe that when you look at the language and look at the manner in which that is applied, look at the different kind of indicators that are going to have an important play upon what is meant by supplanting, again, whether you look at that as the Secretary would like, at the pupil, whether you look at that in the pupil and also the classroom, the school district, those indicators, are you going to look at it simply money, or are you going to look at it benefit?</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.317" offset="12178178">The Secretary must have looked at it not only in terms of money; he had to have looked at it in the sense of benefit, a benefit supplement because he reduced it merely on the fact that we had the lower student-teacher ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.997" offset="12232931">That didn't change the dollars approach to it at all, but still gave us a modification of the amount of money on the basis of the benefit.</text>

New Jersey, and that is whether the state should be held liable in a recoupment action, in a post-audit recoupment action if there was merely a technical violation or if there was a different construction of the statute after the state had had their plan submitted and approved--</text>
