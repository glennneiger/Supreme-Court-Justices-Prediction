            <label>Mr. Bruce M. Hall</label>
            <text syncTime="80.223" offset="436515">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as with the case just submitted, as Your Honor's questions indicate, this, too, is a case involving the application of a state statute of limitations to a 1983 civil rights action.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.256" offset="512584">It arises out of an incident of alleged police brutality.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.669" offset="534213">The petitioners, who were the defendants below, moved to dismiss this action which had been filed some two and one-half years after the incident occurred, and moved to dismiss it on the basis of a state statute of limitation which provided that all actions against government entities and public employees for their torts must be filed within two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.317" offset="648838">It is clear that had the case been filed in state court in New Mexico, that that limitation provision would have been applied and this case dismissed on petitioners' motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.008" offset="711637">The lower federal courts, both the District Court and the Circuit Court, have refused to follow the decision of the state's highest court and apply that two-year limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.678" offset="770256">The petitioners submit that this is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.411" offset="785198">It is wrong under the language of Section 1988, which provides the rule of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.665" offset="814246">It is wrong under the characterization and application of 1988 by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.862" offset="847056">It is wrong, quite simply, because the state judicial decision supplied the state rule of law, and unless inconsistent with the United States Constitution or the policies of deterrence and compensation underlying 1983, that state rule of decision is to be borrowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.646" offset="946112">The cases of the Court on this point are quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.552" offset="973802">There is no basis for distinguishing between a state court judicial decision and an express legislative determination which would by its terms apply to 1983 actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.151" offset="1040153">As a matter of settled jurisprudence, a construction by a state court of a state limitation is itself part of the statute, and does not represent simply a common law decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.056" offset="1119774">Given that fact, I think it is clear that 1988 intended to borrow and have govern, as it states, not only the statutes of limitations which the state courts would apply, but those statutes of limitations, general, which the state's highest court has said are expressly applicable.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="278.074" stopTime="308.954">
            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="278.074" offset="1227921">Mr. Hall, the Court of Appeals, because it took a global approach to this 1983 problem, simply didn't find it necessary to decide what statute New Mexico would apply here, and the District Court below apparently thought the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, the two-year statute, was inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.628" offset="1322066">Is that right?</text>
            <text syncTime="302.910" offset="1327186">And you think the District Court was wrong in its view?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bruce_hall" startTime="308.954" stopTime="388.748">
            <label>Mr. Bruce M. Hall</label>
            <text syncTime="308.954" offset="1351428">Justice, the Circuit Court, I agree, never really reached the question of what was state legislative intent as expressed in the state court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.401" offset="1405136">Now, the District Court opinion is quite interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.974" offset="1419451">The District Judge acknowledges that had there been an express legislative provision saying that this two-year limitation is applicable to actions against governmental entities and public employees for their torts and constitutional torts, that that should have been followed under Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.930" offset="1511297">The District Court essentially disagreed with the New Mexico Supreme Court's interpretation of New Mexico's own limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.888" offset="1551108">Now, the District Judge also found freedom, as did the Circuit Court, in the principle that because we are applying a limitation to a 1983 action, and because characterizations of that action are involved, that that is finally a federal question, and that it is the freedom of this federal question, and that it is the freedom of this federal question which allows the federal courts to ignore the state rule decision.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="388.748" stopTime="395.352">
            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="388.748" offset="1670540">Well, you do concede, of course, I suppose, that there is a federal question involved here on characterization.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bruce_hall" startTime="395.352" stopTime="953.176">
            <label>Mr. Bruce M. Hall</label>
            <text syncTime="396.431" offset="1701260">Most certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.382" offset="1705126">Now, in this case, I said I disagreed, and I am going to take it back just a bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.618" offset="1734069">Where characterization is necessary, certainly that characterization is a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.693" offset="1758311">Where you have an express legislative determination, or where you have the application of the general limitation clearly defined by statelaw, I don't believe that characterization is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.141" offset="1816094">It is still a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.932" offset="1823304">It is simply irrelevant under that analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.084" offset="1835947">I don't think characterization was ever intended by this Court to be anything other than a means of identifying state law, and given the structure and confusing structure of state statutes of limitations, that has been a very necessary characterization for the lower federal courts to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.769" offset="1930615">I think it is very appropriate for the lower courts to attempt in addressing that federal question, Justice, when it is available to the federal courts, to address it as a federal question, and address it in a way that will provide not only some guide to the lower District Courts, but to the entire federal judicial system in arriving at the most analogous state cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.348" offset="2040956">But this question still is a question, though it is a federal question, the question that is really asked is, what is state law?</text>
            <text syncTime="492.005" offset="2083588">And those circuits which have acknowledged that characterization is merely a means of identifying state law, have quite appropriately where there is an express state determination, an application of a particular limitation, said that this characterization is no longer necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.759" offset="2174598">So, it is our position that characterization is what this Court has said it is, and that is only a tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.925" offset="2211274">This statute of limitations, the two-year New Mexico limitation, if there were no state court decision, would certainly be the most analogous cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.104" offset="2259967">It is certainly the most specific applicable to the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.446" offset="2285358">This is a very straightforward physical assault and battery action, though it of course raises grave constitutional actions as well as simply common law torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.165" offset="2340215">But certainly in terms of the underlying facts, there is nothing exotic about it which requires difficult analysis to find the most appropriate limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.106" offset="2387967">The two-year limitation which the state has applies to state causes of actions against law enforcement officers for their assaults and batteries, but also, and we submit this is significant, it is a two-year limitation which applies to a state cause of action against law enforcement officers for bodily injury that they have caused and results in a deprivation of United States constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.727" offset="2526520">I believe this is a very unique provision of state law, when you examine the New Mexico tort claims scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.243" offset="2568525">It contains this quite unusual recognition of the development of 1983 action certainly in the area of actions against law enforcement officers by stating quite specifically that under statelaw, there is a right to sue a law enforcement officer for depriving one of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.798" offset="2662775">So, when you analyze this case in terms not only of underlying facts, who did what to whom, but what are the elements of it, there is a very clear analogy, and the lower federal courts were simply wrong in not following that analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.851" offset="2734977">This statute as well as the case before you does involve drawing a different limitation period for certain actions against public officials and private individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.641" offset="2802164">Private assaults would be allowed three years to sue under New Mexico law.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.606" offset="2829958">This statute allows suits against government entities and public officials for these types of suits to be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.000" offset="2855558">They must be filed within two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.221" offset="2864440">It is argued, of course, that that in end of itself is an inconsistency which requires that this statute be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.457" offset="2897354">We submit that that is not an inconsistency which undercuts, is hostile to 1983 goals of compensation and deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.225" offset="2948450">It is not enough to examine simply the difference in the period of time without, I submit, examining the entire statute in which this limitation is contained.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.153" offset="2996202">And when that is done, Justices, there is something very important found in the New Mexico Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.477" offset="3025459">That Act makes the state in effect a liability insurance company to pay actions, both the state law for torts which can be brought against the state, and also expressly provides that the State of New Mexico will pay all settlements and judgments which are brought against state public officials, not only for state torts but again for deprivation of United States constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.080" offset="3167878">This statutory scheme, which the respondents find so hostile to 1983, in fact makes 1983 recoveries more than, as they can be in some cases, only a paper judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.060" offset="3227856">It guarantees the payment, the compensation which implements 1983 goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.328" offset="3268920">There is necessarily in any state's consideration of meshing its tort claim scheme to 1983 actions considerations which I believe are different than those in the private sector, and what finally must be decided is whether the balancing involved is a reasonable balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.574" offset="3365887">I would observe that Congress as well in considering the availability of private actions versus suits against the government has drawn similar distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.993" offset="3423565">In maritime torts, United States boats are subject to suit within two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.557" offset="3453763">Maritime torts against private owners, three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.080" offset="3467869">So there is necessarily in any consideration of compensation such as the New Mexico legislation is addressed to a balancing of factors, and the question becomes whether that balancing has been carried on reasonably.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.020" offset="3535683">The final test really of inconsistency here is whether any state policy, any state rule, any state interest which is exhibited in that limitation has somehow precluded this respondent from getting to the federal court, and the answer to that is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.639" offset="3630141">For two years the courthouse doors were open to the respondent without any possible hostility exhibited by state law in any respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.698" offset="3690327">The respondent's action here is precluded quite simply because he slept on his rights for a period of two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.323" offset="3736825">No reasonable argument, and it is not made in any of the briefs, is made that that period of time is too short.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.840" offset="3774964">It is the same period of time which Congress in waiving United States immunity allows for actions against federal law enforcement officers under the Tort Claim Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.838" offset="3830971">We submit that this provision, this limitation, which is general in its scope, does not discriminate against 1983 and civil rights actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.606" offset="3877991">It is not inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.429" offset="3885305">And petitioners ask that the motions which they have filed nd pursued in both lower federal courts be granted here, and the case dismissed.</text>

            <text syncTime="957.329" offset="3944865">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the New Mexico Tort Claims Act was enacted as a legislative response to the judicial abrogation of the doctrine of sovereign immunity in the State of New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.093" offset="4027934">It is only a limited waiver of sovereign immunity, and there is no legislative intent within the entire confines of the New Mexico Tort Claims Act that evidences any desire on the part of the New Mexico Legislature to apply the New Mexico Tort Claims Act to 1983 actions which are filed for the deprivation of rights secured by the Constitution and federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.510" offset="4137648">The particular provision of the New Mexico Tort Claims Act which the petitioners in this case seek to urge is the two-year limitation period found in Section 15 of the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, which refers exclusively to torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.441" offset="4209328">And as Chief Judge Bratton of the New Mexico District Court found in analyzing legislative intent, and as the New Mexico Supreme Court in the case of Wells versus County of Valencia found in examining legislative intent in the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, the New Mexico legislature distinguishes between a tort and a constitutional deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.069" offset="4311833">There is no, and I repeat, no expressed reference anywhere within the New Mexico Tort Claims Act to 1983 actions, to 1981 actions, to 1982 actions, to 1985 actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1089.253" offset="4472538">What the court basically did was, it looked to this Court's decision in Timanio, and it said, we think the most analogous statute of limitations is that found in the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, Section 15, based upon a violation of Section 12, which applies solely to law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.246" offset="4544531">The net effect of that decision is that a whole wide range of 1983 actions that simply are not covered, were never intended to be covered by the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, are now apparently under that reading of the DeVargas decision covered by a two-year limitation period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.188" offset="4616316">There is no way that a zoning due process type case filed because of 1983 can come within the arguable confines of the New Mexico Tort Claims Act or be analogous, yet--</text>

            <text syncTime="1162.472" offset="4765423">In Burnett versus Gratton, this Court set forth a three-stage process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.205" offset="4784440">First, the Court said that in attempting to borrow a rule where federal law is deficient, you look to the laws of the United States to the extent that they are suitable to carry the civil rights statutes into effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1211.284" offset="4960714">And three, and I have thought a great deal about the DeVargas decision on certiorari, it was a decision that quashed certiorari as being improvidently issued, and my understanding of the law is that when a decision quashing certiorari is issued, it is not precedent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1766.517" offset="7181645">But the second step of the Burnett versus Gratton test is to look to state law, and for each state it is different, although some of the years are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.962" offset="7215395">It ranges from one year in California to six years in North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.607" offset="7233994">Unless we have an approach that gives that degree of limited uniformity, rather than 50 statutes of limitations, this Court may well be burdened with 150 or 200, and I think the example of the case of Polite from the Third Circuit is strikingly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.507" offset="7305570">In that case there were allegations that there was excessive force used, a false arrest, an illegal search and seizure of a car, and coercion of a guilty plea, and based upon the cause of action, the federal cause of action that was filed, the Third Circuit analogized those claims to state law and found in the same case that a one-year statute of limitations ought to apply to the false arrest claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.806" offset="7418837">The court found that a two-year statute of limitations ought to apply to the coercion of guilty claim and the assault and battery claim, analogizing these to common law torts, and that a six-year statute of limitations ought to apply to the illegal search claim based upon the car... based upon the Pennsylvania cause of action for recovery of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.140" offset="7504100">I suggest that that is not a concrete, proper resolution to the issue of statutes of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.854" offset="7535029">It has caused intolerable burdens on the federal courts, and the cases which we have collected, once again, in Section 9... Footnotes 9, 11, and 13, I think, show that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.930" offset="7575258">The characterization method which the Tenth Circuit utilized and which we think is appropriate and proper is something which this Court has historically engaged in as far back as 1905, and we have summarized that in Footnote 5 of the red respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.833" offset="7650909">In the case of McLain versus Rankin, which was a national bank assessment action, what the Court did was, the Court looked to the law and it said, we think that this action is a liability based upon a statute against the claim that it was a contract action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.464" offset="7713394">The court then looked to the law of the particular state, the forum state, for an analogous statute of limitations, and finding none, the Court then applied the residuary statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.861" offset="7759056">This had been done consistently where the Court as a part of the characterization process determines for itself the essential nature of the federal right which has been conferred by Congress, and then applies the most analogous and appropriate statute of limitations under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.104" offset="7840035">In this case, if one characterizes the action as an action for injury to personal rights, and then looks to state law, the conclusion is that it is the personal injury statute, the three-year statute of limitations, because the two-year limitation provision of the New Mexico Tort Claims Act does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.068" offset="7915895">It refers exclusively to torts, and consistently throughout the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, as was noted by Judge Bratton, and as was noted by the Supreme Court of New Mexico in Wells versus County of Valencia, a decision totally inconsistent with DeVargas, the legislature distinguishes between torts and 1983 actions, and if in fact the legislature had intended the Tort Claims Act to apply to 1983 actions, it would have said so.</text>

            <text syncTime="2023.395" offset="8209198">I think the Court then has to look and see whether the time periods are the same, because if they are giving less time for the 1983 action than for the other action, you have a discriminatory statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.302" offset="8252770">If you have at the same time, if you have a statute of limitations that is a part of let's just say a tort claims act which allows compensatory damages without a limit, unlike the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, which allows punitive damages, unlike the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, which doesn't have a restrictive notice provision, unlike the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, which doesn't discriminate against a federal cause of action, unlike the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, and which allows in this case a cause of action against a police officer for action under color of law but outside the course and scope of his duties, unlike the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, then I think it is appropriate to use that statute of limitations, because it is consistent with this nation's federal civil rights policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2176.777" offset="8822657">If for any reason this Court should determine that the limitations provision of the New Mexico Tort Claims Act should apply to the claim of Gary Garcia, then we would ask that this Court make any such ruling prospective, because prior to the filing of the complaint in this case there had never been any kind of judicial decision which had ever said 1983 actions were governed by the New Mexico Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.461" offset="8921400">The New Mexico Tort Claims Act does not refer to 1983 actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.687" offset="8942298">The decisions of the federal courts in the State of New Mexico were that the action was either a liability based upon a statute or an action for personal injury, either the three-year or the four-year statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.974" offset="8995483">In the Tenth Circuit, it was the policy under Shaw versus Haliburton, which we have pointed out in our brief, that if there was an arguable difference, that the longer statute as a matter of policy should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.622" offset="9050027">For all of these reasons, it would be unfair to bar the claim of the plaintiff in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.808" offset="9078762">For all the reasons that I have mentioned, we would respectfully request this Court to affirm the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2253.987" offset="9131529">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, on the prospectivity issue alone, there was no reasonable reliance by the respondent on any particular view of this rule which was significantly changed or altered by the Tenth Circuit, as the granting of the interlocutory appeal itself indicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.050" offset="9215748">There were indeed different views on whether the two-year limitation should apply, and in fact the Tenth Circuit's decision is a reversal of its prior approach to these cases, which would apply the two-year limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.650" offset="9286174">There is the statement made that again state law has been incorrectly interpreted by state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.697" offset="9318357">The statement is made here several times that there is no reference to 1983 actions as such in the limitation or the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.412" offset="9357227">What it says, and it says specifically, is that there is a cause of action in state law against law enforcement officers for deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.494" offset="9413547">Any tort lawyer can read that quite clearly as a reference to 1983 actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.237" offset="9444476">When you finally come down to it, the question of was the state's decision of its own law wrong, that question really can't even be asked in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.715" offset="9486481">The point is, it is the state's decision, and in the only matter in which this is relevant it is state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2350.008" offset="9515634">Mr. Hall, your opponent did to a certain extent argue that, but I don't understand the Tenth Circuit to have so reasoned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2365.029" offset="9575715">I think that is the significance of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.531" offset="9593687">It is not a happy result for federalism when federal courts directed by a federal rule of decision statute such as 1988 are told to borrow state law, and that it should govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.511" offset="9653665">That state law, as observed and applied in the state courts, is simply relegated to a footnote and regarded as irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.367" offset="9689087">That is not what Section 1988 intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.699" offset="9702357">It is not only an unhappy result for federalism, it is an unhappy result for plain principles of judicial comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.766" offset="9738615">We are left with an irreconcilable difference between state and federal courts in applying their concurrent jurisdiction over 1983 actions which simply cannot and should not be permitted to continue.</text>
