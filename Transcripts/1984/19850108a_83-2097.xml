          <turn speaker="joel_s_perwin" startTime="62.323" stopTime="370.924">
            <label>Mr. Joel S. Perwin</label>
            <text syncTime="62.323" offset="390655">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.690" offset="392118">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the first question is whether this Court's jurisdiction is conferred by direct appeal under Subsection 1254.2.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.112" offset="429839">We submit that the Circuit Court declared unconstitutional as applied a provision of Florida's long arm statute which confers jurisdiction over one who breaches a contract in Florida by failing to perform acts required by the contract to be performed in Florida, in this case, by failing to make payments under a franchise lease and purchase and sales agreement connected with a Burger King franchise in a suburb of Detroit, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.199" offset="546240">Under Subsection 1254.2, the answer to that question depends upon the Circuit Court's chosen resolution of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.821" offset="584693">In this case, as the Circuit Court's opinion states, both parties agree that by its plain language the jurisdictional statute in question plainly reached the conduct at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.279" offset="630459">Rather than revisiting that assumption, the Circuit Court proceeded to consider the constitutional question, and concluded that the District Court's exercise of jurisdiction was inconsistent with minimal constitutional requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.905" offset="688974">We suggest that on that basis, given that resolution, the prerequisites for the acceptance of a direct appeal under Subsection 1254.2 were satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.596" offset="731814">As this Court said in its 1984 Franchise Tax Board decision, a necessary predicate to the Court of Appeals' holding is that enforcement of the state statute would be inconsistent with federal law, hence invalid under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.254" offset="790433">Accordingly, we have jurisdiction under Section 1254.2.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.991" offset="809346">We also argued that the parties' stipulation in the District Court was an appropriate one in light of the plain language of this statute and its interpretation by a clear majority of Florida appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.734" offset="864307">And finally, we argued that independent of the question of direct appeal, the case is one of far-ranging and far-reaching importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.737" offset="896386">It implicates a way of doing business which is increasingly pervasive in our society, and therefore renders appropriate the acceptance of jurisdiction by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.879" offset="940898">My intention would be to rest with that, to submit the position of our brief on that issue, and in the absence of any inquiries, to proceed to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.735" offset="976320">The question on the merits is whether the Circuit Court erred in holding that Florida's exercise of jurisdiction was inconsistent with the minimal requirements of due process, and that requires, of course, that we aggregate the contacts between these franchisees in Detroit and Burger King's headquarters in Miami and determine whether or not there were sufficient affiliating circumstances to put the franchisees on notice that they might be called to answer in a Florida court for any breach of contract or trademark infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.654" offset="1095961">The contacts in this case can be abrogated under two general categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.158" offset="1114038">The first might be applicable to a case in which all we had was an arm's length contract for the purchase and sale of goods, independent of the intimacy of the franchise relationship which we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.132" offset="1165969">In other words, even in the abstract there are a category of signals in the course of this relationship and in the contracts that were created between the parties, which we submit were independently sufficient to put the franchisees on notice of the possibility of a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.010" offset="1229395">For example, three separate contracts, the lease agreement, the franchise agreement, and the purchase and sale agreement for equipment all called for the application of Florida law, creating an unmistakable signal of Florida's interest in the case, and under this Court's pronouncement in the International Shoe case, suggesting that the franchisees avail themselves of the protection and benefits of the forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.091" offset="1321764">Second, the lease agreement called for arbitration to be held in Florida if necessary, which this Court has at least acknowledged might represent a forum of implicit consent to jurisdiction of the Florida courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.416" offset="1371083">Third, the contracts are replete with references to Miami as Burger King's headquarters and as the locus of decisionmaking in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.772" offset="1408490">They identify Burger King as a Florida corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.408" offset="1419044">The initial franchise offering circular informed the franchisees that Burger King conducts its business in Miami, that that is the locus of decisionmaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.597" offset="1455824">All notices were required to be sent by the franchisees to Miami.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.049" offset="1473587">All payments were required to be sent by the franchisees to Miami.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.520" offset="1491455">Payments for rent, for royalties, advertising, real estate taxes, and that, incidentally or parenthetically, should have made very clear to the franchisees that a default in their payments would necessarily cause economic injury in Miami.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.862" offset="1548820">Indeed, in its recent decision in the Calder case, this Court in a footnote adopted the "effects" test which had been utilized by the Circuit Court for the proposition that the defendant should have realized that the effects of his conduct would be felt most deeply in the forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.228" offset="1750276">I don't contend that that alone is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.828" offset="1760725">It was, however, it seemed, however, to be sufficient in the torts context in the Calder case, in which the Enquirer article in question was aimed at a resident of California who suffered the injury in California.</text>

            <text syncTime="857.554" offset="3571638">Yes, Your Honor, that is what I am referring to, and what I find significant in that is that the Court of Appeals appeared to have accepted that concession rather than undertaking any scrutiny of the Florida decisions in this area, and thus far we have undertaken such scrutiny in our briefs and we have suggested that the clear majority of Florida decisions comport with the parties' agreement below.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.304" offset="3682606">There was a second set of contacts in this case independent of the disparate and abstract references to Florida as the center of decisionmaking for Burger King which are perhaps even more significant, and that is that this was not an arm's length purchase and sales agreement, which is the subject matter of the many Circuit Court opinions that we have discussed in this case in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.689" offset="3780200">This was a 20-year interdependent franchise agreement, a lease and sublease agreement whose purpose was to create a continuing relationship between the parties, not to separate them at some arm's length, but a continuing relationship between the parties in which the franchisees willingly subjected themselves to a degree of intimate control over the quality and the very finest details of the franchise operation, and received substantial consideration for that agreement, the consideration of minimizing the risk of failure and of maximizing the chances of success by trading on a national reputation, a national marketing structure, and a built-in clientele.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.804" offset="3984582">That, it seems to me, is a central distinguishing feature of your typical purchase and sales agreement in which you have parties from two jurisdictions, and which it calls for the application of the law of one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.429" offset="4031080">In this case the franchisees had the unilateral power to reject the formation of that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.368" offset="4066815">They had the perfect option, had they desired, to create a purely local enterprise to control it 100 percent free of any or almost any connection with interstate commerce and to do so free of any control by anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.179" offset="4138077">They made the decision to reject that option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.548" offset="4151556">Instead they applied to Burger King Corporation for franchise operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.935" offset="4173186">Mr. Rudzewicz is and was the senior partner in an accounting firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.689" offset="4196174">He had no expertise or knowledge in the restaurant business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.057" offset="4209653">He did this because by subjecting himself to such rigid standards and controls, he was able to achieve or seek an investment success in an area in which he might not otherwise have been able to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.032" offset="4261480">He made that affirmative voluntary decision, and that seems to us to be the most significant character of this relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.404" offset="4295021">He purposefully entered into a meaningful business relationship with a corporation which he knew to be centered in another jurisdiction, and there are a plethora of decisions by this Court on both sides of the issue which seem to make that a controlling factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.664" offset="4360014">For example, in the McGee case, it was the insurer who had solicited the business of the insured by sending voluntarily and unilaterally a reinsurance certificate into his state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.805" offset="4404631">In Keeton, it was the magazine who had made the purposeful decision to disseminate in the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.728" offset="4432320">In Calder, it was the newspaper which purposefully directed its article toward the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.564" offset="4463667">All cases in which the defendant had the unilateral ability to avoid the contact which he voluntarily created, and on the other side of the ledger, in, for example, the Hanson case, it was because the trustee had undertaken no unilateral activity of his own which might have subjected himself to jurisdiction that this Court denied Florida's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.497" offset="4555409">In the Kulko Case, it was because the wife had moved voluntarily to California and the husband had no control over that activity and had undertaken no unilateral contact of his own, that this Court held that the exercise of jurisdiction was inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.089" offset="4613715">In the Rush case, it was because the insured had no control over the ubiquity of his insurer, State Farm, and over its presence in some other jurisdiction, that this Court held that the exercise of jurisdiction over the insured was inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.016" offset="4673483">And it was in the Worldwide Volkswagen case that the Court held that the regionally focused retail and wholesale outlet had no control over the decision of a purchaser to create a contract with a jurisdiction 1,500 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.626" offset="4735863">In every one of those cases, the dispositive observation seems to have been that the defendant purposefully engaged in activity which he had the unilateral control or ability to avoid, and that is precisely what we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.320" offset="4798662">In addition, the cause of action grew out of that activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.189" offset="4814126">There is no question that the requirement of a connection for the exercise of specific jurisdiction was satisfied, and finally, it seems to us that there is no significant unfairness in Florida's exercise of jurisdiction under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.032" offset="4873476">We listed five factors which we thought relevant to the issue of fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.103" offset="4893852">I would like to mention all five, and then come back to two, with your permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.805" offset="4908585">One, Florida of course has an interest in protecting a Florida corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.523" offset="4927498">That encompasses the notion of sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.408" offset="4938991">It also reflects... it reflects at the deepest sense the state's interest in prescribing a statute which reaches as far as possible to protect the contractual expectations of Florida residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.634" offset="4987893">As I mentioned, or may have mentioned, in the Keeton case this Court seemed to place dispositive reliance upon New Hampshire's interest in adjudicating a libel action even for the benefit of a New York resident against a California publisher primarily because New Hampshire had an interest in protecting its own residents from the exposure to libelous material, and it was the interest of the forum that seemed to be important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.167" offset="5086113">So, there are cases which stress this, and Florida has an undeniable interest in protecting the business expectations of its residents in the context of a contractual obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.455" offset="5127178">We will hear a lot of talk about the inconvenience of the franchisees having to travel to Florida and about the interest of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.228" offset="5162286">That kind of argument works both ways, and it is equally relevant to emphasize that Burger King had a contractual expectation in Miami that Florida by the plain language of its jurisdictional statement sought to accommodate that expectation, and that the inconvenience of having to prosecute the suit in Michigan would have been comparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.243" offset="5250371">Second, Florida has an interest, of course, in enforcing its own law, and that interest is magnified in this case by the assertion that the law of some other jurisdiction might apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.182" offset="5290077">Third, Burger King has an interest in a convenient forum and in some consistency of result across a regulatory system which depends for its economic success upon the adherence by franchisees to a rigid and exacting set of operating requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1956.108" offset="7965852">So, Burger King suggests that a non-act, a failure to do an act, a failure to mail a check in and of itself is a contact if the state law requires you to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2881.417" offset="11667089">We think they should opt to sue their franchisees in Michigan, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.635" offset="11679942">They haven't done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.404" offset="11687047">They have elected not do to that, not to sue their franchisees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.688" offset="11696138">They want to bring them all to Miami, including, I guess, the ones from London and Spain and New Zealand and Guam, where they elsewhere have offices, and perhaps Alaska and Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.794" offset="11732605">That would be manifestly unfair, to make a new rule in minimum contacts that says, just because you are dealing with a national business headquartered in one spot, you should go to them because you are put on notice they might sue you there, even if there are no minimum contacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.304" offset="11790596">We think it is manifestly unfair that he should have to travel the 1,200 miles to Miami to fight this lawsuit when he never set foot in Miami about this deal, and has no contact with that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.712" offset="11836258">And Burger King's new approach that they are suggesting here is wholly different from what it used to be, and from what is, from what is the state of law at this present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.634" offset="11871889">The Court of Appeals noted that all of the contacts were in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.936" offset="11893101">They reviewed the record, and they noted the fact that Rudzewicz was interviewed there, and that the Michigan office discussed price terms, and that the Michigan office attended the final closing ceremony, and that there was no evidence that Rudzewicz bargained with anyone in Miami, only with people in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.147" offset="11961960">So, every single contact with Burger King happened in the State of Michigan, with the Michigan staff, and the bargaining occurred there, and the acceptance of these gentlemen as franchisees occurred in the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.455" offset="12011174">So we think that since all essential elements of the transaction are found in Michigan, that is where the lawsuit should be, and that is where the contacts are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.794" offset="12040536">We feel there needs to be some protection of franchisees in order to protect it as a form of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.715" offset="12064255">If this Court were to rule that franchisees could be sued wherever the headquarters of the franchise was, then franchisees who do business in the future have to be able to say, I have to build into the cost of doing business enough reserve money to one day be able to go to Florida and defend myself against Burger King.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.576" offset="12135726">If you take a look at the normal profit on the sale of a hamburger, it is around ten cents on a $1.25 hamburger, and to finance a lawsuit like this, to pay both sides might cost a couple of hundred thousand dollars, which means selling about two million hamburgers in order to make enough profit to set them aside in reserves to defend a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.404" offset="12206988">The local business is not in a good position, is not well equipped in serving a small community to have to finance such distant litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.144" offset="12238022">Of course, there is the inconvenience on the part of the franchisees, who had to either bring deposition testimony down or bring all of the live witnesses down.</text>

            <text syncTime="3195.236" offset="12922325">That is unfair, and I think that if we look at what that will mean, it will mean, and Burger King conceded that, perhaps bringing franchisees from foreign countries to Miami, if they can get away with that, to sue people in Miami.</text>
