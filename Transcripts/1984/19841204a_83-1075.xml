          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="31.369">

            <label>Mr. Richard K. Willard</label>
            <text syncTime="31.369" offset="252440">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="112.506" offset="576985">This case presents the question of whether scientific researchers utilized by CIA during the 1950s and '60s in Project MKULTRA are intelligence sources within the meaning of Section 403(d)(3) of the National Security Act of 1947, and thus exempt from disclosure under Exemption 3 of the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.039" offset="675205">I am going to argue today, first, that the Court of Appeals incorrectly interpreted the National Security Act, and second, that nothing in the Freedom of Information Act supports or requires the Court of Appeals' interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.362" offset="728495">Now, the Court of Appeals adopted a two-part test for deciding if a person or institution is an intelligence source under Section 403(d)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="160.570" offset="769246">The first part of the test dealt with the relevance of the information provided by the course to CIA's intelligence function, and the second part of the test dealt with the need for confidentiality of that source.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.078" offset="823268">The first part of the test is not an issue here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.032" offset="839150">The District Court found that CIA could reasonably determine that this research, referring to Project MKULTRA, was needed for its intelligence function, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, and the Respondents did not seek this Court's review of that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.077" offset="907277">The second part of the two-part test is the issue today.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.879" offset="922533">The Court of Appeals held that an intelligence source must provide information of a kind that CIA could not reasonably expect to obtain without guaranteeing the confidentiality of those who provide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.789" offset="982196">It is our position that this second part of the two-part test created an unwarranted and unreasonable gloss on the plain language of Section 403(d)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="224.779" offset="1026082">The practical consequences of this second part of the test, especially as spelled out by the Court of Appeals in its second opinion in Sims, is to exclude three categories of sources which we believe Congress clearly intended to be covered under the 1947 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.724" offset="1101942">The first excluded category are open sources, periodicals, radio broadcasts, public speeches, and the 1947 Act's legislative history shows Congress was informed that the bulk if not the majority of our intelligence would be developed from precisely those kinds of open sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.953" offset="1174771">The second category excluded by the Court of Appeals' definition are unwitting sources, that is, sources that don't know they are providing information to CIA when they provide information to someone they think may be a trusted confidant or perhaps even a fellow conspirator in their activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.981" offset="1242899">Again, it is hard to see how these sources can be protected under the Court of Appeals definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.051" offset="1263170">Since they don't even know they are being sources, it is hard to see how they can require a pledge of confidentiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.122" offset="1287516">Finally, and perhaps most shockingly, the Court of Appeals definition excludes even sources who ask for and receive an express pledge of confidentiality from CIA if either they are, as the Court of Appeals said, unreasonably and atypically leery of cooperating with CIA, or if they are providing the type of information that CIA could have obtained readily and openly from other sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.189" offset="1395767">The harms of this narrow definition adopted by the Court of Appeals are evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.193" offset="1423770">Among other things, revealing these kinds of sources will necessarily reveal the topics of interest to CIA which it is pursuing, even if it is pursuing those topics of interest by trying to develop information from open sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.536" offset="1481135">More importantly, in many cases, the inability to preserve the confidentiality of sources will cause them to dry up.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.708" offset="1509870">As this Court recognized in its opinion in Snepp, providing confidentiality of intelligence sources may be vital to assuring their continued cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.664" offset="1553651">The point of all of this is not that the Court of Appeals was insufficiently school in the craft of intelligence to prepare the correct definition for when confidentiality of intelligence sources is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.741" offset="1606001">The point is that in the 1947 National Security Act, Congress assigned that responsibility to the Director of Central Intelligence and not to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.097" offset="1647379">It is difficult for courts to obtain evidence and make studied judgments as to when sources should or should not be kept confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.070" offset="1687294">Courts can be abusive in the way they determine these issues, as was the District Court in the Fitzgibbon case which we cite in our briefs, where the Court decided that it could second guess the judgment of the Director of Central Intelligence as to whether events had sufficiently changed in the Dominican Republic so that sources there who were once confidential would now be proud to have been associated with CIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.786" offset="1782170">In addition, even if the courts make the right determinations as to whether sources should or should not be kept confidential, these sources may not trust that the courts will make the right decision in their cases, especially when the passage of time may cause the concerns of the intelligence source to be somewhat less appreciable, much as is the situation in this case, where many of the sources are 20 or 30 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.568" offset="1885302">In conclusion, it is our position that Section 403(d)(3) means what it says when it says that the Director of Central Intelligence shall be responsible for protecting intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure, and this plain language of the statute is totally inconsistent with the second part of the two-part test crafted by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.869" offset="1982477">Further, we believe that nothing in the Freedom of Information Act charges this interpretation of the National Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.343" offset="2028348">Exemption 3 of the Freedom of Information Act incorporates by reference certain other statutes that provide for withholding of particular kinds of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.032" offset="2067114">Once you decide that Exemption 3 applies to a particular statute, then it is thew underlying statute and not the Freedom of Information Act that determines whether or not a particular kind of information can be withheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="1588.098" offset="6479405">By this means the courts determine whether the withholding action of the Agency conforms to the congressional judgment that this is one of the sorts of matters to be withheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.714" offset="8537854">The argument about guaranteeing confidentiality and the Court of Appeals requiring the breaking of the promise of confidentiality also assumes that the CIA makes guarantees of confidentiality, but the CIA in its very... in its brief on the institutions questions, makes it clear that they reserve the right on any occasion to disclose an intelligence source if for any one of a number of reasons they believe that it is appropriate to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.804" offset="8678183">Thus, for example, here two-thirds of the institutions were disclosed by the CIA despite their position, first, that the institutions were intelligence sources, and despite their position that the disclosure of the institutions would lead to the disclosure of the principal researchers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.200" offset="8755819">Indeed, the District Court found that six of the principal researchers received either implicitly or explicit guarantees of confidentiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.323" offset="8796257">Yet the CIA disclosed institutions at which five of those principal researchers were working.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.227" offset="8819872">The CIA also disclosed the principal researcher engaged in the most sensitive of the MKULTRA projects involving the administration of drugs to unwitting subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.451" offset="8868773">So both because the perception argument based on the Court of Appeals requiring perhaps the breaking of an unnecessary promise, and because rarely will courts override a CIA definition that a guarantee was in fact necessary, the Court of Appeals we think was right in saying that you should leave open the possibility that reviewing de novo subject to the substantial weight standard, you could require the CIA to disclose an intelligence source despite the fact that the source was provided an assurance of confidentiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.246" offset="9051943">Now, the CIA also attacks the Court of Appeals decision because it would require the disclosure of many matters which are required, plainly required in the national interest to be kept secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.489" offset="9104920">But the fundamental objection to that is that the CIA would have 403(d)(3) carry the full burden of protecting national security information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.678" offset="9141700">403(d)(3) is part of a statutory scheme, other parts of which are also devoted to protecting national security information, the national security exemption, the intelligence methods provision, 403(g) pertaining to CIA employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.157" offset="9219650">But the CIA also errs in treating the Court of Appeals appeals construction as if it were a statutory definition contained in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.797" offset="9262177">The formulation of the Court of Appeals and the inquiries required by the Court of Appeals construction of the statute in this case were not intended to be applied to most persons involved in the kind of CIA operations cited in the CIA's brief, the secret agents, the recruiters of other intelligence sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.413" offset="9356636">The Court of Appeals was very clear in it opinion at pages 10a and 11a of the appendix to the petition that these inquiries would not be applicable in the run of the mill intelligence source case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.803" offset="9406164">The reason for the construction was that this was a peripheral case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.374" offset="9428525">Now, the District Court said we don't need to make a definition of an intelligence source because this is so clearly beyond what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.980" offset="9470948">The CIA insisted that there must be a definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.884" offset="9486516">The Court of Appeals came up with a definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.269" offset="9500100">He think it is basically a workable definition, but the Court doesn't have to decide that that is an appropriate construction of the statute in order to affirm the result below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.410" offset="9556629">Rather, because of the unique facts of this case, because these were domestic scientific researchers in a declassified program, no indication, with a few exceptions who are to be withheld, that there was any desire for confidentiality, the documents destroying the program were destroyed, and so the only way we can find out the details of the program are to talk to the researchers and find out what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.929" offset="9674703">And finally, insofar as Conngress has ever addressed the question of the MKULTRA researchers and the files... not the researchers, excuse me, but the MKULTRA files, it has said that it desires that MKULTRA files be available for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.890" offset="9738546">It cautioned that MKULTRA files were not to be treated as operational files.</text>

            <text syncTime="2531.842" offset="10254412">I would like to address very briefly the question of the institutions which was raised in our cross petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.496" offset="10280952">The CIA's principal argument in that regard is that disclosure would lead to the identification of the principal researchers who were intelligence sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.702" offset="10321808">Now, we accept the argument in principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.654" offset="10329645">Assuming that they are intelligence sources, and assuming that disclosure of the institutions would lead to the identification of the identification of the researchers, that is enough reason to allow the names of the institutions to be withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.711" offset="10381890">The problem is in the application of that principle to the facts in this case because the CIA never carried its burden of showing, a burden which it has under 552(a)(4)(B), the burden of sustaining its action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.073" offset="10443330">Although its brief says over and over that the Director of Central Intelligence has made a judgment that disclosure would lead to the identification of the principal researchers, there is no evidence in the record to show that the Director of Central Intelligence made that judgment, nor is there any evidence in the record to show that the Director of Central Intelligence believes, or that there is reason to believe that disclosure of the institutions would lead to the identification of the principal researchers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.907" offset="10558582">The affidavits never say that, and all we say is that the CIA is required its burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.229" offset="10591914">Moreover, the CIA has identified two-thirds of the institutions, including those for five of the six principal researchers who got guarantees of confidentiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.154" offset="10635591">There is apparently... they apparently did not believe that identification of those institutions would lead to the principal researchers, and there is no indication that the undisclosed institutions are any different than the disclosed institutions, institutions like the National Institutes of Health, Stanford University, large institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.216" offset="10715839">Now, if the CIA could show or had shown that the undisclosed institutions were different, that these were small operations where simply by knowing the name of the operation you should figure out, or a sophisticated observer could figure out that these are the people who were the principal researchers, coupled with the determination that the principal researchers are exempt from disclosure, this would be a different case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2686.442" offset="10872783">I would like to start with the issue raised in the cross petition which I have not previously addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.994" offset="10890964">There is no disagreement on the legal theory here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.012" offset="10903085">As Mr. Levy admits, they agree that if the disclosure of an institution could lead to the identification of a researcher, and if we can withhold the researcher's identity, then we ought to be able to withhold the information about the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.004" offset="10951045">What he challenges is the factfinding of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.289" offset="10964107">He claims the evidence in the record is insufficient to support the finding of fact by the District Court, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, that such a disclosure could be expected to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.514" offset="11009037">We think that just common sense establishes that the disclosure of institutions could establish the identity of the researchers, or create a risk of that under the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.554" offset="11053236">Let's keep in mind that the District Court had before it a very extensive record, including elaborate answers to interrogatories providing detailed facts about each of those MKULTRA projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.010" offset="11095032">All of the documents were declassified, with only the names of the researchers and institutions deleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.497" offset="11116975">Under those circumstances, it is not hard for the jigsaw puzzle to be completed if something is turned over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.751" offset="11142053">A good example of this appears on page 59 of the Joint Appendix, which is a document describing one of the MKULTRA research projects, Subproject 146.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.043" offset="11183222">The name of the institution and the researcher is deleted, but the document says that the researcher has recently retired from his position as Chief of Pathology, and goes... of the institution, which was deleted, and goes on to say that he is a world reknowned plant pathologist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.885" offset="11242572">Now, even at a fairly large institution like Stanford or Harvard there may not be very many world reknowned plant pathologists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.539" offset="11269112">It doesn't require much common sense to see that the District Court's finding of fact here that the disclosure of these institutions could identify the researchers can be amply supported in the evidence in this record, and if the Court reviews all of the evidence in the record about each of these projects, I think the Court will come to share that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.703" offset="11349779">In addition, the argument has been raised about a sort of estoppel argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.173" offset="11371721">Since we disclosed two-thirds of the institutions, why don't we disclose the rest of them?</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.891" offset="11390530">That argument we think has no force, and in fact, is pernicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.695" offset="11405785">If the government could be estopped by making a partial disclosure and thus held responsible for disclosing additional information, it would have a chilling effect on voluntary disclosures under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.601" offset="11449357">Now, whether Admiral Turner made the correct decision in 1977 or '78 to disclose some of the institutions, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.507" offset="11481018">Perhaps some of those institutions that were disclosed could in fact lead to the identification of the researchers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.328" offset="11504319">But it is not our burden today to justify the disclosures that were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.196" offset="11519783">It is to justify the information that was withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.064" offset="11531277">And this kind of estoppel argument being used against the government, if credited, would have a chilling effect on the kind of voluntary disclosures that go on every day under the Freedom of Information Act because we would be afraid if we disclosed some information voluntarily, that that would be held against us, and we would have to disclose some other information we didn't want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.293" offset="11604211">For that reason, we think the arguments raised in the cross petition should be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.030" offset="11627094">If I could return briefly to a couple of points that were raised with regard to the principal issues in this case, the Respondents seem to be arguing that Section 403(d)(3) should not be given its plain language meaning because we can protect intelligence sources when we have to under the classification exemption, Exemption 1, or maybe because they are methods rather than sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.895" offset="11718628">This is simply an illegitimate form of argument under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.764" offset="11734092">Each provision in the act stands on its own feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.549" offset="11745168">If we qualify under Exemption 3, we qualify, even if another exemption might also be available in some cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.686" offset="11769723">That is precisely the argument Respondents are making that was rejected by this Court in FBI v. Abramson where the Court held that the availability of possibly an Exemption 6 argument should not distort the way Exemption 7 was interpreted under that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.963" offset="11830850">It is our position here, too, the fact that something might also be a method as well as a source, or might also be classifiable, doesn't keep it from being a source within the plain language of Section 403(d)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.170" offset="11875676">The question was raised, well, why should Congress care more about protecting intelligence sources and methods under 403(d)(3) than other kinds of classified information, under (b)(1) which are subject to, it is alleged, a more intensive kind of judicial review?</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.482" offset="11944952">We don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.898" offset="11946624">That's the plain language of the statute, and it is not necessary that Congress in enacting various statutes over a period of time always act from a coherent pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.986" offset="11978912">But a good reason might be that intelligence sources and methods are like the goose that lays the golden egg: if those are endangered or compromised, then additional disclosures will not occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.694" offset="12017782">Our country has always treated intelligence sources and methods as the most highly sensitive kind of classified information or of national security information because when they are compromised, it compromises our ability to learn future intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.601" offset="12073370">That is amply demonstrated in the legislative history of the 1947 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.053" offset="12087163">This Court has frequently remarked upon it in its decisions such as Snepp and Haig v. Agee, that the confidentiality of intelligence sources is of preeminent importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.425" offset="12128750">So if it is necessary for us to justify what Congress did in its plain language, there is the justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.913" offset="12154663">Finally, with regard to the ability to protect open and secret sources, 403(d)(3) is not limited to secret intelligence sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.054" offset="12199176">It talks about intelligence sources generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.322" offset="12208267">In the hearings that led up to the 1947 Act, the testimony was quite clear, the testimony which was cited at page 16 of our petition, quoted there by General Vandenberg, who had been the director of CIA's predecessor operation, said that he thought roughly 80 percent of intelligence should normally be based on open sources, including books, magazines, technical and scientific surveys, photographs, commercial analyses, newspapers, and radio broadcasts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.127" offset="12335535">So it is our position that Congress quite clearly intended that the term "intelligence sources" would comprehend both open as well as secret sources, and that in giving the Director of Central Intelligence the authority to protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure, it was intended to be interpreted broadly, and that there is no basis for the second part of the two-part test created by the Court of Appeals in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.111" offset="12439398">Unless there are any further questions, that will conclude my argument.</text>
