            <text syncTime="222.416" offset="1024058">"Agencies that seek to influence the determination of public policy through litigation shall not be eligible to participate in the Combined Federal Campaign. "</text>
            <text syncTime="232.313" offset="1063660">The issue in this case is remarkably narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.886" offset="1085916">Everyone agrees that the respondent's right to engage in fundraising activities is constitutionally protected, and no one contends that every charity should be constitutionally entitled to participate in the Combined Federal Campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.167" offset="1147043">So that the problem is one of line drawing.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.078" offset="1162716">Who is to be admitted and who is not, and by what criteria does the Constitution permit that distinction to be made?</text>
            <text syncTime="268.765" offset="1209423">The controlling issue as seen by the Court of Appeals, by the respondents, and by the petitioner, is whether drawing the line where the President has drawn it, the same line that existed through five previous Administrations, is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.279" offset="1279536">The respondents and the Court of Appeals are absolutely correct in our view in focusing on reasonableness as the relevant and controlling constitutional question, and we will join them orally, as we have in the briefs, on that issue as the issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.220" offset="1347245">But I want to do so against the background that this necessarily assumes and correctly assumes that we are dealing here with a non-public forum, and that assumption is a correct one.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.457" offset="1400221">The only public property, indeed, the only place that is at issue in this case is the federal work place, which the federal government most assuredly has not opened generally for expressive activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.461" offset="1476185">It is simply a recognition at the outset that that is the correct analytical framework, but even if it did not, we would contend that what the President did was still constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.720" offset="1541283">But in any event, there is general agreement that the focal point for analysis in this case should be whether the President's decision was feasible, that is, whether there are differences between these respondents and the Combined Federal Campaign eligible charities which are sufficiently relevant to legitimate governmental objectives that the eligibility criteria are reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.975" offset="1634279">We submit that there is not only a reasonable distinction, but that each of the three objectives stated in the executive order constitutes a separate and independently sufficient reasonable ground for sustaining the criteria, and I will discuss each of them separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.408" offset="1703973">First, while the government's exclusion of advocacy groups is consistent with the practice of employers generally, the government's involvement in charitable fundraising has a dimension that is not shared by other employers who participate in charitable solicitation efforts, and it is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.640" offset="1780982">Governments have taken upon themselves the obligation of caring for the needs of the poor, of assuring that certain minimum levels of food, clothing, shelter, and educational opportunities are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.030" offset="1834481">Segments of that obligation have been undertaken by the federal government, and under those circumstances it is perfectly proper for this same federal government to make some reasonable judgments concerning those organizations whose efforts are most likely to achieve that objective and thereby to minimize the extent to which this task must be performed by government itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.487" offset="1940329">It will not do in this respect to point to some individual instances where in the opinion of some legal advocacy groups have in fact succeeded through litigation in obtaining money for the poor, because in the first place those efforts sometimes succeed, and they sometimes yield nothing, but even more important, there is in fact a difference in the way that these groups go about performing their tasks.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.946" offset="2058194">The eligible groups render their services directly, and by contrast, legal advocacy groups attempt to influence the action of other persons and entities, including governments, and they frequently find themselves opposing each other in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.826" offset="2117648">Under those circumstances, it is surely reasonable, it is surely constitutionally permissible for the President of the United States to make some judgments concerning whether a dollar given to a direct providing traditional charity is more likely in general than a dollar given to a public advocacy group to lessen the government's overall burden of providing for health and welfare.</text>

            <text syncTime="657.200" offset="2763186">And that is the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.012" offset="2774471">I turn next to the second objective stated in the executive order, which is to minimize disruption in the federal workplace, reduce the costs of fundraising, and maximize the success of the campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.139" offset="2826925">In other words, the President, we submit, could reasonably conclude that the campaign would be less costly and would raise more money structured as he structured it, and this borne out by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.612" offset="2892858">The nature, the tone, and the magnitude of the controversy that was engendered by the inclusion of these advocacy groups during the interim years when the lower court orders have so required, the difficult barriers that these create for those who attempted to carry out the government's fundraising objectives are summarized in our brief at Pages 37 through 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.755" offset="2973420">I would particularly invite the Court's attention to Pages 346 through 392 of the Joint Appendix, which does give a fair sample of the kinds of problems that these volunteers who were charged with the responsibility of running the campaign encountered because of the inclusion of these particular groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.969" offset="3066207">Now, it is, of course, impossible to tell what the performance of the campaign would have been if those groups had been included, what the cost would have been in terms of dollars and time, and how much money would have been raised if things had been other than they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.401" offset="3136006">But two things are very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.031" offset="3146455">First, the inclusion of these groups did pose widespread and serious problems in the judgment of those who were charged with the stewardship of running the campaign, and second, and probably even more important, precisely because no one can make a comparison of what was with what might have been, this is the kind of decision that has to be made by someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.398" offset="3239973">Someone has to make those judgments, and it must be upheld so long as it is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.201" offset="3259199">Here it is the President who had made the judgment, and it is consistent with the judgment of his five predecessors, and is clearly reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.346" offset="3291800">The respondents rely on the Hecklers veto cases, and they contend that their First Amendment rights cannot be suppressed by those employees who disagree with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.694" offset="3333178">Their reliance is misplaced for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.674" offset="3349061">One is that none of their cases involved a non-public forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.578" offset="3372675">And in cases where a non-public forum was involved, the potential disruptiveness of the activity in terms of disruptiveness to an ongoing governmental activity has been a major factor in upholding constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.868" offset="3425861">And I will mention just two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.227" offset="3431294">One is the Perry case, in which the Court found it relevant that exclusion of a rival union from the school mail system would help to preserve labor peace within the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.704" offset="3469224">And Lehman versus City of Shaker Heights recognized that exclusion of political advertising from mass transit vehicles was justified in part because it would avoid involving the city in controversy and jeopardizing its revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.235" offset="3523350">This just isn't a Hecklers veto kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.745" offset="3537351">This brings me to my second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.648" offset="3544979">It is a non-public forum case in which the President has made some judgments about the best way to enlarge employee involvement in a fundraising effort while keeping down the disruptive effects of that effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.767" offset="3609449">The third reasonable basis for the President's distinction is avoiding both the reality and also the appearance of using federal resources to advance a particular political cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.534" offset="3648528">This one is squarely supported by the Court's holding in Lehman versus Shaker Heights, where concerns about a voiding the appearance of favoritism were held sufficient to sustain a policy permitting advertising generally on the city's buses, but excluding political candidate advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.556" offset="3720626">I would like to invite the Court's attention now to one feature that is common to all three of the President's objectives and that I believe is dispositive of the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.846" offset="3777782">Underlying each of those objectives is a Presidential resolution of an issue which is partially factbound and whose factual components cannot be verified one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.374" offset="3835879">It is not known, for example, and cannot be known whether in fact health and welfare organizations that provide their services directly have a greater ameliorative effect on the total governmental welfare burden than to entities such as these respondents, whose mission is to effect public policy through the bringing of lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.730" offset="3917276">Neither can it be empirically verified whether the inclusion of these groups in this campaign will or will not affect such things as the ability to campaign to raise money or its costs in dollars, employee time and disruptiveness, or an appearance of favoritism.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.679" offset="3981119">But one thing is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.100" offset="3990732">This Court has faced that same problem in other cases and uniformly has accorded governmental officials the benefit of a presumption in favor of their factual judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.848" offset="4045799">In Perry, for example, the school board's judgment was necessarily based on a determination that restricting access to the mailboxes would, and I am quoting from the opinion,</text>
            <text syncTime="986.534" offset="4080489">"serve to prevent the district schools from becoming a battlefield for interunion squabbles. "</text>
            <text syncTime="991.099" offset="4098775">And in Lehman, in Greer, and in Jones, those who were charged with specific governmental responsibilities made some judgments, some factbound judgments concerning the likely effect of their decisions on such matters as perceptions of political favoritism and the maintenance of discipline within a military base or a penal institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.612" offset="4184874">In each institution, that judgment was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.355" offset="4203787">Under this Court's precedents, therefore, the Constitution does not prohibit a Presidential decision on the ground that the factual correctness or incorrectness of his determination cannot be verified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.251" offset="4247359">I have just one final point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.525" offset="4256450">We submit that this just isn't a case in which there has been a first amendment violation or any serious implication of First Amendment values.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.371" offset="4307859">The significance of the Combined Federal Campaign is not the expressive opportunity that it offers to charities to convince people to give money to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.281" offset="4359477">It offers very little opportunity for that kind of appeal, and there are in any event ample other available means which are far more effective for that purpose, such as direct mail, door to door solicitation, commercial advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.161" offset="4419036">The reason that these respondents or anyone else would like to be included in the Combined Federal Campaign is not because of opportunities that afford expression, but rather because it is a very effective money-raiser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.971" offset="4486223">It is, in the respondent's own words,</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.523" offset="4500434">"qualitatively superior to any other alternative means of fundraising among federal workers. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.109" offset="4530840">This just is not like the situation, therefore, in Village of Schaumburg, where government has imposed a negative on any fundraising efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.734" offset="4569292">The only governmental action in this case has simply been to decline to confer upon a particular individual or group the financial advantage of a more effective fundraising opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.906" offset="4642017">The Court of Appeals attached controlling significance to the fact that the government has already determined these petitioners to be charitable because of their qualification for income tax exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.846" offset="4693740">That argument, which is central to the Court of Appeals decision, is highly instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.319" offset="4719653">The determination of what is a tax-exempt organization is made for purposes quite different from those that underlie the determination of eligibility criteria for the CFC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.446" offset="4760195">This is highlighted by the fact that if the two were the same, there could be over 300,000 participants in the campaign, a circumstance for which no one contends and everyone agrees would be undesirable and unworkable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1205.528" offset="4956532">In other words, if the distinction between the legal advocacy groups and other groups is not within the President's constitutional power, then I do not see any basis, any constitutional basis for distinguishing churches, universities, or any others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.922" offset="5050050">We submit that what the President did in this instance clearly is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.119" offset="5074814">Of course the lines could have been drawn in other ways, but the Constitution does not so limit the President, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.395" offset="5119954">I would like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Stephen Ralston</label>
            <text syncTime="1253.739" offset="5149315">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, it is also respondent's position that the issue presented by this case is a narrow and specific one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.647" offset="5196963">We would state that issue somewhat differently, however.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.090" offset="5210755">And our statement of the issue is, can the government prohibit charitable organizations from participating in the solicitation of federal employees for donations of their money because, Number One, those organizations use litigation to obtain health and welfare benefits for their clientele, and Two, because some federal employees find such organizations controversial or objectionable on some basis or other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.560" offset="5332590">And I think to frame that issue I would like to emphasize a few key facts that are well established by this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.907" offset="5369998">First of all, the only thing at issue in this case is access of the respondent to designated funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.291" offset="5403539">There are two types of moneys obtained in the Combined Federal Campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.794" offset="5421511">Undesignated is money that is put into a general pot to be distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.616" offset="5436871">Designated funds are money that particular federal employees decide freely, voluntarily, on their own to give to a particular organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.892" offset="5477936">That is all any of the respondents get is money that federal employees want to give us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.646" offset="5500923">Second, tens of thousands of federal employees have given the respondents in excess of $1 million in the time period that we have been in the Combined Federal Campaign, again, freely and voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.576" offset="5560692">The third fact is that the respondents do in fact provide health and welfare services, and the government really has never contested that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.623" offset="5600920">The record is replete, as was held the first time this entire issue was litigated, with examples of the health and welfare services we supply, and I will come back to describe some of those in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.465" offset="5664241">The only basis, the only basis for excluding us, and really the proper term is expelling us after we had been in the campaign, is that we accomplish these goals through litigation, litigation activities which this Court has held are at the core of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.677" offset="5745116">We are not Political Actions Organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.980" offset="5758282">We do not do lobbying activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.772" offset="5769462">Some of us don't do any at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.141" offset="5774896">The rest do whatever lobbying or legislative activities as what any charitable organization can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.105" offset="5798824">The record is clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.678" offset="5805093">And the Solicitor General has referred the Court to the letters that are in the record which provided the impetus for our expulsion and I agree, these letters should be read because they are replete with misinformation and a misunderstanding of what we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.340" offset="5887745">There are charges that we are political organizations, that we aren't charities at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.582" offset="5904672">These facts are simply wrong, and this was the main basis for the opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.946" offset="5922122">The fifth point is that the respondents have at all times sought to participate in the Combined Federal Campaign, a forum that it establishes in ways totally compatible with that forum and fully in accord with the regulations that set it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.828" offset="5997668">We are not seeking to wander the halls of government buttonholing federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.173" offset="6019088">We simply want to do the same things that other organizations are allowed to do, which is to have under the regulations here in question our names and 30-word statements in the brochures, and we have reproduced in the appendix to our brief a couple of these brochures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.153" offset="6087007">That is what is at issue, whether we can get that information before federal employees, and whatever other free speech activities are allowed by the particular local Combined Federal Campaign, to get that information before federal employees when they are deciding whether they will give them money at all, whether they will designate it, and if designating it, to whom they will designate, to whom they will give their money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.142" offset="6194945">And this campaign, these methods that the government has set up and which we do not contest, are the only way to reach federal employees effectively as an audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.888" offset="6249906">There are no equivalent alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.839" offset="6257743">The courts below in a series of cases held that, and to urge that direct mail, for example, is just as good is simply inaccurate from a fundraising point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.209" offset="6303196">The State of New York, for example, in its amicus brief has pointed out one of the great advantages of this method of raising funds is that it maximizes the funds available for the charitable activities of the organizations themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1561.080" offset="6378742">Do many people throughout the government employee ranks designate rather than not designate?</text>

            <text syncTime="1567.875" offset="6405910">Yes, Your Honor, in recent campaigns there has been approximately 60 to 65 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.839" offset="6433704">Before the changes in 1982, there was no encouragement to designate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.762" offset="6457423">So approximately 65 percent of the funds were undesignated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.315" offset="6471634">However, in 1982, the government, when it changed the regulations, encouraged designations, and in the past years the predominant amount of money has been through designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.364" offset="6519803">Again, we only get designated funds, that is, money that people want to give to us as individual organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.237" offset="6547284">The final point is, as the District Court found, based on what the government put in the record, the motivation for expelling us from the campaign was controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.155" offset="6599007">There were some federal employees who didn't think we should be in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.948" offset="6614158">They were opposed to our continued inclusion, and the government acquiesced to that and ejected us from the campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.834" offset="6649684">I think it is also important to focus on exactly what the rule is that keeps us out, because the government has talked a lot about having to draw lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.262" offset="6691480">Our position is, the line that is drawn is simply an unconstitutional one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.545" offset="6712587">We are excluded, and all elements of the rule result in our exclusion, Number One, because we litigate, Number Two, because our litigation consumes in excess of 15 percent of our budgets and/or $1 million, Three, we litigate on behalf of others, and Four, we are selective in our litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.439" offset="6796179">That is, the cases we select are related to particular causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.132" offset="6814883">If any one of these isn't present, we would be in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.355" offset="6831810">For example, legal aid societies which expend 100 percent or close to it of their budgets for the purposes of litigation are accepted into the Combined Federal Campaing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2043.926" offset="8310132">But they were attempted to be kept out because they were too controversial, even though their services were clearly within the scope of these regulations, and that is what the District Court so found, and again, I refer the Court to the Planned Parenthood amicus brief, which describes that entire incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.649" offset="8377005">Our basic position is that the fact that some people think that we shouldn't be in is essentially legally irrelevant and in fact a constitutionally unacceptable reason for ejecting us.</text>

            <text syncTime="2099.392" offset="8531963">And I would like to recount briefly the precise history of our involvement in the Combined Federal Campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.539" offset="8564564">The government in its brief simply leaves out a very important piece of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.142" offset="8582954">In 1980, three organizations that were basically legal organizations applied, the Special Contribution Fund of the NAACP, which is a separate organization, Puerto Rico Legal Defense Fund, and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.342" offset="8651709">The Special Contribution Fund was let in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.515" offset="8660486">We were excluded under the direct services rule, basically on the ground that we weren't legal aid societies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.830" offset="8685668">If we were, we were in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.660" offset="8692982">Because we weren't, they said we were out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.641" offset="8700923">We brought an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.682" offset="8709074">Judge Gesell not simply that that provision was vague, but that the direct services rule was inconsistent with the Executive Order enacted in 1961 by President Kennedy which the government relies on in giving a continuous history of 20 years of everybody understanding what it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.216" offset="8795278">All I can say is, I didn't understand the Executive Order to exclude us, nor did the regulations exclude us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.512" offset="8824430">I didn't even understand the direct services rule to exclude us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.846" offset="8841776">Judge Gesell found that the direct services rule, which has basically been resurrected by the government now, was inconsistent with the executive order because the executive order was not limited to health and welfare agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.042" offset="8886497">It stated health, welfare, and other appropriate agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.135" offset="8902902">In 1981, we were all let in, or five of us, excuse me, were let in because the government said they didn't have time to try to redo the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.243" offset="8947310">Late in 1981, they proposed... OPM proposed to the President a new Executive Order which would be very similar to the Executive Order and regulations that are here at issue which would exclude us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.571" offset="9000705">The President did not adopt that Executive Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.783" offset="9013557">Rather, he enacted a superseding Executive Order which retained exactly the language that Judge Gizzell had held did not exclude us, health, welfare, and other appropriate agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.343" offset="9067787">The government then issued regulations that specifically included us, not under court order, but under the provisions of the President's new Executive Order, and announced that it had decided to remove any doubt of our being able to participate by stating that we were entitled to be in as health, welfare, and/or other appropriate agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.206" offset="9155245">So, we were in, and the other two respondents came in, along with some other legal defense funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.603" offset="9184816">Now, between 1979, the year... I'm sorry, 1980, the year before any of us were in the Combined Federal Campaign, and 1983, when all of us were in, receipts from the Combined Federal Campaign rose from $87 million to $109 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.849" offset="9297769">That is an increase of 25 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.890" offset="9305919">The government says, well, the level of participation went down, but again, in the year before any of us were in, that is, 1980, 59 percent of federal employees gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.588" offset="9352731">The first year any of us were in, 1981, when five of us were admitted, receipts went up, and 60 percent of federal employees gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.825" offset="9393691">There was no controversy in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.788" offset="9409573">The government has produced no letters from anybody complaining about the fact that we were in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.212" offset="9431203">1982, there was a controversy engendered almost exclusively because one particular organization came in, and our position is that the government could have taken reasonable steps to deal with that controversy including informing the people who were writing the letters that they had all their facts wrong, which was in fact they case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.698" offset="9525139">They didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.006" offset="9530363">They simply said, all right, we are now going to change our mind and throw all these legal defense funds back out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.950" offset="9554187">So it is simply not accurate to state that there is this historical understanding that everybody always had that traditional charities, whatever that term is supposed to mean, were the only ones ever intended to be in the Combined Federal Campaign.</text>

            <text syncTime="2385.932" offset="9678112">If it means organizations that serve as conduits of money from one group to another, if one looks at the list, primarily such organizations are in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.337" offset="9719699">But legal aid societies, for example, were in as subagencies of local United Ways, and this was why when we applied in 1980, and were told, well, you would be in if you were a legal aid society, and you are out because you are not, and that is because we don't provide direct services, we didn't understand that at all, quite frankly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.903" offset="9806008">I still don't understand the attempted distinction, among others, between us and legal aid societies, since whatever we do, we do through litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.989" offset="9842370">So, this concept of traditional charities and the notion that somebody had that in mind all along, even if it can be defined, which I contend it cannot be define, is circular anyway, because it still doesn't get around to the question of whether assuming such a restriction existed, whether it was a reasonable restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.301" offset="9923559">The government also relies on the argument relating to appearance of impartiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.546" offset="9956577">Of course, we think the government should be impartial also, but it is not being impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.549" offset="9976535">It is essentially saying, look, we think there are some agencies that are really worthwhile, some agencies that aren't so worthwhile, and we don't want federal employees even to be able to think about giving to the agencies that we don't think should get the money, so we are not going to let even their names or 30 words be before the federal employees.</text>
