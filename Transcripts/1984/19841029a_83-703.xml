            <text syncTime="16.776" offset="207378">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents one narrow issue, whether the word 189 of the Atomic Energy Act to refer to all proceedings or only to certain types of formal agency proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.619" offset="262758">This case began when the respondents sent a letter to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission asking the Commission to suspend the license of the Florida Power and Light Company's Turkey Point nuclear plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.058" offset="300479">Under the Commission's procedures, such a so-called Section 2.206 request from the public must be evaluated by the Commission staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.814" offset="331512">If the request is found to present a substantial health or safety concern, the Commission will issue an order to the operator of the plant asking it to show cause why its license should not be suspended, modified, or revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.555" offset="382503">Here, the Commission staff evaluated respondent's request, in the process compiling a 547-page record.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.542" offset="410402">On the basis of this record, the director of the Commission's Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation concluded that respondent's request did not raise a substantial health or safety concern, and be therefore issued an opinion declining to take action against the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.654" offset="470902">Respondent then challenged this decision in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit, but that court decided that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.408" offset="505906">The court based its decision on the language and the two-part structure of Section 189.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.478" offset="526177">Section 189(a) provides for hearings in proceedings relating to the licensing of nuclear plants that are held before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.400" offset="561808">Section 189(b) then makes provision for review in Courts of Appeals of all orders entered during the course of proceedings of the kind described in Section 189(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="116.458" offset="606112">Here, the Court of Appeals read the word 189(a) to refer only to formal agency action, and it therefore concluded that the types of orders made reviewable in the Court of Appeals under Section 18(b) are only orders entered during the course of such formal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.003" offset="676224">The court therefore concluded that challenges to the denial of Section 2.206 requests had to be reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard first in the District Court with the decision of those courts in turn made reviewable in Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.179" offset="736933">This system of judicial review devised by the Court of Appeals in this case, which departs from the practice followed in several of the circuits, finds no support in the statutory language or legislative history, and advances no identifiable interest to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.772" offset="791372">If the Court of Appeals believed that the word "proceeding" generally applies only to formal agency action, it plainly was mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.443" offset="818017">The Administrative Procedure Act, which is incorporated by reference into the Atomic Energy Act, and therefore should control in this case, defines the term "agency proceedings" to include a wide range of agency action, formal and informal.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.568" offset="870471">Among other things, agency proceedings under the APA include all agency process respecting the grant, denial, or modification of a license.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.036" offset="1420400">The Court of Appeals, as your question suggested, based its decision on a semantic approach to the language of Section 189.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.975" offset="1452165">It entirely ignored the APA and the Hobbs Act, and instead noted that Section 189(a) provides the hearing shall be held in proceedings which raise licensing related issues before the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.720" offset="4199098">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to emphasize at the outset that in deciding this case, the Court below gave no consideration whatsoever to the relationship of the judicial review provision in the Atomic Energy Act, Section 189, the section we are dealing with now, to the overall scheme of regulation which the Act put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.209" offset="4341099">Now, whether they didn't do it because they did not permit briefing of the issue, and whether they simply overlooked it, or whether they considered the matter not to be relevant, I of course do not know, because they simply didn't consider it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.140" offset="4424796">I submit, however, that however lacking in neatness the language of Section 189 is, that this is a very important matter to be considered in interpreting the section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.120" offset="4504730">Now, a very important, if not the most important objective of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 was to make it possible for the first time for private ownership and operation of nuclear power reactors, and the most important... that private ownership and operation was the course to be made subject to a very close type of regulation, and perhaps the most important instrument of such regulation was licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.171" offset="4712978">The Act made it a crime to own or operate a nuclear reactor without a license, and provided elaborate provisions in Section 189 for how licenses were to be issued and provide for their revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.800" offset="4783405">Viewed from this point of view, what you had was an Act which was creating a large national administrative system in which licensing was key.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.608" offset="4834709">Section 189 therefore provided that in any proceeding respecting the issuance, amendment, or suspension of a license there would be Court of Appeals review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.550" offset="4898448">This, of course, was wholly consistent with this idea of a national system of regulation in which licensing was key.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.341" offset="4945573">It provided for judicial review of any proceeding, and it did not necessarily turn, as courts which have considered the question before, for example, D.C. Circuit, when it first considered this question, it made it applicable to proceedings relating to licenses at any stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.742" offset="5043166">Accordingly, earlier, this, the D.C. Circuit determined that consideration of the jurisdiction of the question whether enforcement or licensing action should be undertaken was the first stage of a proceeding of the type that Section 189 expressly conferred authority on the Courts of Appeals to review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1359.843" offset="5579617">What he did was amass the existing material relating to the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.431" offset="5609919">He went to the material publicly at hand within the Commission, and if you look at the record in this case, what you will find is, there were not, for example, submissions in response to this thing, to this letter, as respondent suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.762" offset="5691316">We, for example, Florida Power and Light, the licensee, did not file a response.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.166" offset="5716916">It was not because we didn't know it was there, but because we thought that the material was available to the director.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.688" offset="5750980">If you look at his decision, he looked at material relating to the two technical questions, steam generators and pressurized thermal shock, amassed them, saw, appraised the nature of the supposed threat, put this together in a coherent opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.750" offset="5823287">In effect, he gave Ms. Lorion exactly the response she had asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.839" offset="5855574">That is, he gave immediate consideration to it, and then, on the basis of the existing technical material, some of which had been previously submitted by us, some of which had been previously prepared by the NRC staff which was dealing with this technical problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.900" offset="5931852">He advised Ms. Lorion why he was not going to take the action she wanted.</text>
