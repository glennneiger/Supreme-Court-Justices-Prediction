            <text syncTime="19.728" offset="221459">These consolidated cases present two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.180" offset="235251">There is an initial jurisdictional issue, an issue that we have raised with regard to the second of the two cases, as to the standing of the Democratic Party and the jurisdiction under Section 9011(b) of the Act, their jurisdiction to bring it.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.006" offset="294497">I consider that that issue has been covered thoroughly, the arguments on both sides, in our brief and the brief filed by the Democratic Party, and did not intend to address it at this point unless there are questions from the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="50.266" offset="343607">I have one question, Mr. Steele.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.966" offset="350399">Is your argument diminished at all in its force by the fact that the FEC brought a suit on its own in this case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles N. Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="60.222" offset="383418">We do not consider that it is, because as we read the statute it seems to us that, though there is jurisdiction in the FEC to raise those issues, that the question in the statutory construction, that Congress did not intend private parties to be suing each other, is the same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.814" offset="445798">So we think that the two are severable.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.552" offset="464711">With regard to the central question posed by this case, which we would say is the power of Congress to limit aggregations and expenditures of wealth by political committees, which are organizations whose purpose is to influence the outcome of federal elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.628" offset="529077">Where presidential candidates have agreed to accept public funds in lieu of private financings for their campaigns, we would say that there is no limitation in the Constitution or particularly in the First Amendment on the power of Congress to limit those expenditures as it is done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.523" offset="600652">This case arose because the Appellees, two political committees, asked the Commission, in light of this Court's decision in the 1981 term in Common Cause versus Schmitt, in which this Court affirmed the decision of the court in the District of Columbia by a four to four vote, the Appellees asked the Commission for an advisory opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.305" offset="695738">They asked for an advisory opinion to the effect that that decision made such expenditures in excess of the limitations of 9012(f)... were permitted under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.612" offset="744953">The Commission answered in an advisory opinion that it did not think that the Court's decision in this case was dispositive of the constitutional issues, and reaffirmed in that advisory opinion its earlier opinion that Congress had in 9012(f) banned expenditures by political committees in amounts greater than $1,000 where presidential candidates have accepted the public financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.745" offset="845472">There are really two reasons that we see why this statute did not violate the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.963" offset="866370">First of all, Congress found that there was a great necessity to protect the integrity of the Government and the public perception of the integrity, the public confidence in the Government, from the corrosive effects of public financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.872" offset="921958">And that was well documented to Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.447" offset="972322">And Congress had long considered these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.899" offset="986115">They had felt that a system in which they could have... set up public financing which would substitute for private financing, was one which could reduce those effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.374" offset="1028016">The second reason that we think that the First Amendment does not bar what Congress here has done is that Congress has very consciously and deliberately in this statute left ample scope for individual and group expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.549" offset="1084753">Turning first to the question of the purposes of the statute, of what Congress sought to achieve, we think that the record demonstrates that Congress knew what the effects would be where it had passed the public financing statute after years of debate, a statute which limited expenditures, which prohibited contributions to the candidates, and which created a system in which public financing was not merely a subsidy to the candidates of the two major parties, but was seen as only a substitute in which public financing was the major part of the package in which other forms of expenditures were limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.610" offset="1248907">But Congress knew that committees such as these would take over the role that had previously been held by large contributors, and it was one of the factors that was very prominent in the debate in front of Congress; indeed, as we have set it forth in our reply brief, the debate which went on not only in 1971, which went on way back into the history of these statutes in 1966 and '67, when there were long, long debates in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.678" offset="1361233">But Congress estimated and looked at the question of whether, if you prohibited these private contributions and came forward with public financing, would there not be a situation where private financing would come forward making expenditures which were not in control of the candidate or in control of the candidates' parties, but which would be done by committees composed of the candidates' supporters, composed of people who were, as I say, in the business of raising and expending funds to influence the elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.784" offset="1505638">And Congress concluded that they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.603" offset="1512953">Congress concluded that in that situation you would have in effect a candidate who would be beholden to these large aggregations of private funds, a candidate whose campaign was limited to $40 million in this recent election under public financing, but who looked out there and saw that groups were available who could make those expenditures on his behalf, millions of dollars, campaigns that replace and support his campaign, that the effect would essentially be the same, that he would wind up in the election needing to woo that private money, needing to know that that private money would come forward on his behalf, and thus would be in the long run beholden to that private money in the same way that he would have been beholden in the situation where there were private contributions.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.532" offset="1692675">Couldn't Congress have achieved pretty much the same result here without limiting the speech of third parties by saying that, where this contributing takes place by a private group that appears to be coordinated, that the candidate will lose so much of the public financing as is represented by the coordinated expenditures?</text>

            <text syncTime="414.165" offset="1799150">In the course of the debates, Congress considered a variety of ways of trying to limit this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.021" offset="1830602">The difficulty in all of them, I think, for Congress was the belief that was strongly argued that if you did not reach out to the committees, that you were going to have a difficulty with the standard of committees that seemed to be composed of supporters; that at some point... what they were always debating was the reach of the statute, of how far it could reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.053" offset="1922762">And where they drew the line was to the very political committees that are in the business.</text>

            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="449.422" offset="1940211">Well, my thought stemmed from the fact that I think Congress would have been on a stronger footing so far as the First Amendment is concerned where it says, we're going to deduct some of the money we're giving you, to the candidate, where you're just dealing with the Government handing out money, rather than saying, we're going to forbid you from making a certain kind of expenditures for speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="469.050" offset="2018683">I think that the concerns that Congress expressed throughout it were, however, there's another countervailing interest, which is in not having someone make a determination in the two months before the election that the funding should be reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.326" offset="2075839">In other words, one of the things that Congress saw was a system where there would be an immediate block grant known in its amount to the candidate, and that there would be a grave danger that you would be interfering with the very speech of the candidate which the public fund was attempting to support if you got into a system where someone, the Federal Election Commission or some form of decisionmaker, would have to decide, well, that group is so allied with the candidate that we'll reduce the candidate's funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.246" offset="2191509">And I think that they saw great difficulty with systems that involve that kind of interference.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.299" offset="2415745">I think that Congress spoke of it in many terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.134" offset="2431105">They spoke of it as the fact that they knew from past experience, they knew from their own personal experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.855" offset="2453988">I mean, the debates are full of indications that they knew in their own personal experience the ways that private money would flow into the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.727" offset="2489410">They had historical examples in front of them of how previous statutes where they had had narrow definitions of the terms "contribution" and "expenditure", where political committees sprang up, that there was no ability to prove immediate coordination, where there was perhaps no need for coordination in the sense of direct contact about expenditures, but spoke of the need for control of expenditures where they were done by political committees, particularly ones that comprised... there was a good deal of conversation about the presidents clubs and things that were rot directly in the control.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.050" offset="2626709">And that what Congress foresaw and what Congress predicted, what Congress held long hearings on, was the very questions that are presently before this Court: How could it devise a system by some method which would allow it to reach out and counteract the evil it saw in political committees that were composed of people who were supporters of a presidential candidate?</text>
            <text syncTime="645.765" offset="2725557">Because it felt that if it did not control to some degree those, that it would have a system in which you would have unlimited private spending, where the candidate would be held back, where the candidates' party is held back, and where the balance would be overthrown.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.175" offset="2779265">And in that sense, I think that the '67 debates that we have set forth are very prominently figured there, because the original Long Act was a proposition which was passed by Congress in 1966 and which then in 1967, in a six-week debate in front of the Senate, was eventually made ineffective until further legislation was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.903" offset="2858154">The very subject in debate there was the question of whether a subsidy to the two major parties with no restrictions of any kind on it, no restrictions at that stage on contributions to the candidate's party or to the candidate, a variety of other restrictions, no accountability.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.096" offset="2926909">The Congress debated the issue, in a sense, of whether or not... what you had to do to have control of that private financing in a public financing situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="793.940" offset="3318327">As well as the question that was before the Congress... and as I say, I think that the one major thrust of our argument is that Congress knew the problem it was facing, discussed it in great detail, had hearings on it, had testimony in what was, I would re-emphasize, a very broad constitutional debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.937" offset="3402233">It was not solely a constitutional debate about the issue of the control of expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.574" offset="3420832">There was also a constitutional debate about the propriety of the check-off, which this Court resolved in Buckley versus Valeo.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.411" offset="3448208">There were proposals to have the check-off allow people to designate their parties on the check-off, which was felt by many necessary not to interfere with the political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.533" offset="3488646">There was also a very strong debate about how to structure a public financing law so that it would not interfere with the rights of third parties, and one of the factors, if there is no control on independent expenditures, is that the subsidy that is then put forth puts third parties at a greater disadvantage.</text>

            <text syncTime="910.679" offset="3785188">But that there is a difference in the constitutional balance with regard to expenditures; that the question is how those expenditures affect the process.</text>

            <text syncTime="967.014" offset="4010572">It covered individuals, groups, political committees, all kinds of associations.</text>

            <text syncTime="986.511" offset="4088522">The second point that I would want to make is that in this broad debate there was considerable concern expressed by Congress, that is that is enshrined in the statute, which was noted in Buckley versus Valeo, allowing for individual and group speech and associational rights to come forward in the political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.674" offset="4169188">They have been listed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1011.209" offset="4187369">First of all, under this very statute individuals are not limited in their expenditures.</text>

            <text syncTime="1020.649" offset="4225090">It seems to me, to the contrary, what it shows is that Congress was very sensitive to the balance it was making, and in a Constitution whose basic protections are for individual rights, while you have a question of whether those individual rights to associate and to operate through a group have been curtailed by the statute, nonetheless the very protection of individuals to spend is of great importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.146" offset="4307114">There are also protections in the statute for volunteer activities, for expenditures toward political meetings and groupings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1427.445" offset="5852309">So in essence the only difference here between the Appellees in this case and NRWC, and that case, is that NRWC failed to register under the particular provision, the particular regulation of the Federal Election Commission that would have taken it out from underneath 441(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="1485.882" offset="6086053">The argument on NRWC and the fact that you cannot distinguish the corporate form of NRWC and the corporate form of the Appellees was indeed made to the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.088" offset="6122833">I think what Judge Becker was saying in attempting to distinguish NRWC was, it is a different case for the following reason: He said that in corporations, when you're dealing with corporations, you're dealing with an economic entity rather than an ideological entity, and that was the basis of his distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.865" offset="6193991">I think that's a faulty basis, because NRWC is not an economic entity, it is an ideological entity, similar to the Appellees, which has in fact the same purpose as the Appellees, which is to attempt to influence federal elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.892" offset="6254073">My basic point is that if you look at what NRWC was as an entity, their corporate form, how they were structured, and you look at the 441(b) prohibition, which is absolute, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to find any distinction between that case and that particular party and these particular Appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.473" offset="6336411">They are all corporations, they are all nonprofit corporations, they are all ideological corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.109" offset="6358980">None of those three parties have any input at all from their contributors as to how they are run or how they are managed or how the expenditures are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.065" offset="6402762">So in the 441(b) situation which was present in NRWC, this Court unanimously upheld a total prohibition on independent expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.004" offset="6438497">What we have in the Fund Act is a somewhat less restrictive limitation, in that it does permit the $1,000 spending limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.444" offset="6472247">And we would urge the Court to closely look at the 441(b) and the NRWC analogy to see if there are any distinctions of constitutional dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.251" offset="6515506">There are always some distinctions, but we would argue that there are very, very few, if any; in fact, there are no distinctions of constitutional dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.125" offset="6558974">Earlier questions focused on the difference between coordinated expenditures and independent expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.427" offset="6580185">Part of the problem with that in this setting... and I think it's a problem that the Congress recognized... was that it is virtually impossible in the space of an election campaign... that is, from the time the candidates are nominated until the time the election is held... for the Federal Election Commission or any other decisionmaking body to determine what is and is not a coordinated expenditure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.508" offset="6660538">For example, with respect to Justice Rehnquist's question about a different type of statutory scheme where the candidates' dollar totals would go down if coordinated expenditures were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.780" offset="6697632">Well, if you put yourself in the position of the candidate, it's an impossible choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.167" offset="6711216">If you say to a candidate, you'll have $40 million unless at some time later somebody decides that somebody made a coordinated expenditure, the candidate's going to say, no, thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.356" offset="6751967">That is just a practical reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.475" offset="6760430">If the public funding scheme is going to work, if candidates are going to accept public funding, which every single major party presidential candidate has done since it went into effect, there must be a certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.164" offset="6799196">There must be a certainty that they will get the full grant that's coming to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.533" offset="6812675">Otherwise they're going to have to turn it down and say, I'll take my chances getting private contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.703" offset="6837335">And so as soon as you start to focus too much on the distinction between independent and coordinated expenditures, you get into, I think, a can of worms, because those are very difficult decision, they're very fact-oriented, and there's no way at all that they can be made within the space of the campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.719" offset="6925420">I think it's also important in considering how 9012 interacts with the other provisions of the Fund Act to remember that as a whole the Fund Act, as this Court found in Buckley, enhances pertinent First Amendment valves by releasing candidates from the rigors of fund-raising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.513" offset="6996577">In other words, it does two things: It gives candidates more time to discuss issues that are important to the country, rather than trying to raise funds; and in addition, it enables the candidates to in theory discuss those issues in a more open and free-flowing fashion and not worry about how it might affect potential financing support.</text>

            <text syncTime="1809.492" offset="7380473">And this Court in NRWC said that it was within the Congress' discretion to make a determination that organizations like corporations, labor unions, or, I believe the quote is, "other similar organizations" are worthy of this type of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.204" offset="7447346">And we would submit that this is... that the Appellees are other similar types of organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.624" offset="7473051">They aggregate funds and they spend money which is not theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.492" offset="7488515">And 9012(f) does not attempt to regulate the expenditure of funds by individuals, that is, when they are spending their own money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.229" offset="7511398">It does not attempt to regulate the expenditure of funds by groups; that is, when groups of people actually band together, pool their money and spend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.050" offset="7538670">All 9012(f) attempts to regulate is an organism which accumulates funds from contributors, and when those contributors have no control or say over how those funds are spent then you have a political committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.810" offset="7597707">And it is only in that circumstance that 9012(f) would apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.530" offset="8032593">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.248" offset="8047536">It is our position in these cases that Congress did not intend that section 9012(f) apply to limiting independent expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.585" offset="8080868">We say that because of the Congressional history and legislative debate surrounding Section 9012 in the Fund Act passed in 1971 and its predecessor legislation, the Honest Election Act of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.012" offset="8134576">And we say so because of the wording of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.066" offset="8154742">Secondly, we contend that if the statute is construed by this Court to reach independent expenditures, then it cannot survive and that it unconstitutional, because it may be sustained only if it fosters the goal of guarding against real or apparent corruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.662" offset="8241155">And we suggest to this Court that there is no legislative evidence of connection between independent expenditures and corruption, nor is there any record evidence of such a connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.370" offset="8283996">This statute is a criminal statute which operates in an inarguably First Amendment area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.857" offset="8313985">As such, we suggest that it should be read and construed narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.028" offset="8334673">Section 9012(f) was lifted almost word for word from Section 310(f) of the Honest Elections Act of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.918" offset="8386187">It is for that reason that we have argued to the Court that the legislative debate surrounding that statute is pertinent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.745" offset="8441462">Section 310(f) was the result of a compromise between Senator Long, who wanted simply to fund presidential elections... and the '67 Act also funded senatorial elections... and do no more, and those who, led by Senator Gore, wanted not only to fund presidential and senatorial elections, but in aid of that public funding wanted to limit expenditures by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.112" offset="8554938">310(f) was a compromise between those views.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.549" offset="8568731">We believe that the legislative debate surrounding 310(f) shows that what 9012(f), which is the successor to 310(f), was intended to do was force publicly funded candidates to live within the budget provided by the public grant, by limiting expenditures by party-connected non-authorized committees to pay... and this is the language from the Senate report about the Honest Elections Act... "for a candidate's expenses".</text>

            <text syncTime="2172.576" offset="8832776">What was happening in 1967 and what Congress had seen happening was that party-connected but unauthorized committees... that is, committees that had not been authorized in writing by the candidate to make expenditures on the candidate's behalf... were out paying expenses for the candidate, paying for his trips into a state, for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.172" offset="8919189">That is what Congress struck at in the '67 Act and, we urge by implication, in 9012(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.963" offset="8958373">Now, in 1971 there was precious little debate about the true intent of Section 9012(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.634" offset="8989093">What debate there is, however, we have set out in our brief, and that centers on a debate between Senator Pastore and his opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.376" offset="9044055">Curiously enough... and we readily concede this... Senator Pastore is the only one who discussed independent expenditures, and he argued both sides of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.149" offset="9079163">At one time he said 9012(f) was not intended to reach independent expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.034" offset="9094628">So long as the people are independent of the candidate, they are free to speak as they will, he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.105" offset="9118974">He is the only one, on the other hand, who suggested at one point in his debate that it might reach independent expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.676" offset="9145201">But in the end he came back to his original position, which was that it was not intended to reach independent expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.245" offset="9167457">His opposition, following the lead of Senator Gore back in 1967, who was then no longer in the Senate, wanted to expand Section 9012(f) and to have it reach all manner of groups, everyone save individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.124" offset="9239033">They were unsuccessful in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.459" offset="9244362">Their effort was turned back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.011" offset="9254602">The debate on the '67 Act and the 71 Act is extensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.265" offset="9283545">I have read many, many pages of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.134" offset="9291069">And I may be wrong on this, but I believe I can say to this Court that nowhere in that debate does Congress address independent expenditures by independent groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.608" offset="9340910">The concern back them was non-authorized but party-connected committees, because, frankly, big-time independent expenditures did not exist back then.</text>

            <text syncTime="2320.255" offset="9423562">We believe that it now reaches, that it was intended to reach, only party-connected expenditures for a candidate on his behalf or those that were otherwise somehow coordinated with him, at his request or suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.649" offset="9493152">And we readily concede that if the Court construes it that way, then Section 9012(f) today is redundant and unnecessary, because since '71 when the Act was passed Congress has now characterized such expenditures as in-kind contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.493" offset="9552502">In 1974 they did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.928" offset="9562220">So now the Fund Act would be redundant... or, excuse me, 9012(f) would be redundant, if this Court read it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.034" offset="9594611">But we are looking at Congressional intent in 1971, and the Fund Act has not been tampered with since.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.605" offset="9624913">Congress has been silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.073" offset="9638811">We believe that the very wording of 9012(f) itself supports our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.626" offset="9661067">That statute prohibits not all expenditures, not any expenditures, not independent expenditures, but only those which, if incurred by a candidate or his authorized committee, would further his election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.518" offset="9708610">We believe that that awkward wording itself suggests that what Congress was striking at were expenses paid for a candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.624" offset="9741002">And there are other common sense basic principles of statutory construction which we believe support our contention that the statute should be read that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.896" offset="9774125">One, Congress knew how to outlaw all or independent expenditures when it wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.967" offset="9802337">This Court had no trouble understanding that that's what Congress intended to do in 608(e)(1) in Buckley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.953" offset="9826370">Congress didn't do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.089" offset="9838909">Two, if Congress was really concerned about independent expenditures and the real or apparent corruption of expenditures, of independent expenditures on candidates, then they struck at that goal in a curious way when they exempted wealthy individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.355" offset="9927934">And wealthy individuals existed back before 1971 and they certainly exist now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.675" offset="9953220">The record in this case shows that ten individuals spent more than one million dollars to support Mr. Reagan's election in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.428" offset="9980179">One of them spent sore than a half a million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.999" offset="10002540">And finally, it is curious that Congress put no similar independent expenditure limitation, if that's what it is, in the Primary Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.938" offset="10042246">There is no restriction upon independent expenditures during the presidential primary campaign, even though that campaign is publicly funded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.442" offset="10076309">Now, this Court in Buckley upheld the Fund Act on two grounds: first as a means of eliminating the influence of large private corruptions... excuse me, contributions; and secondly, as a means of relieving candidates of the rigors of fund-raising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.367" offset="10132002">Section 9012(f) furthers neither of those goals, for: first, it addresses expenditures, not contributions; and secondly, candidates are already publicly funded; they no longer have to face the ordeal of fund-raising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.111" offset="10195010">Each of them in 1984 received $40 million in furtherance of his campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.400" offset="10220087">In addition, because 9012(f) exempts individuals and exempts the institutions of the press and broadcast media, it is woefully underinclusive and leaves the field of independent expenditures wide open to those influential groups and individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.380" offset="10308068">Where a statute, like 9012(f) does, operates in an area of First Amendment freedoms, it can be upheld only if it serves a compelling governmental interest, and even then only if it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.073" offset="10370762">Since Buckley it has been clear that when a statute limits campaign expenditures the only compelling interest sufficient to uphold the statute is the avoidance of real or apparent corruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.881" offset="10417991">We have already argued that Congress did not intend in 9012(f) to reach independent expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.785" offset="10441606">But if the Court finds that it did, then Buckley teaches that corruption must be the evil aimed at by that statute, and only corruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.740" offset="10485491">And it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.192" offset="10495313">There was much talk about corruption resulting from contributions, but not from independent expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.829" offset="10517883">Indeed, there was precious little, if any, talk about independent expenditures, because they almost didn't exist back when the Fund Act was being passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.154" offset="10563127">Secondly, there is no legislative connection whatever between independent expenditures and corruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.308" offset="10591758">First, as I said, because independent expenditures almost didn't exist; and secondly, because in 1976 this Court found... and the record before it was a complete record... that there was no evidence of corruption sufficient to uphold an independent expenditure limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.567" offset="10652780">It's no wonder, then, that Congress didn't find corruption in 1971.</text>

            <text syncTime="2646.731" offset="10729475">It was indeed concerned about corruption, and it was to relieve the possibility of corruption from direct contributions to candidates that it said: We will not permit those; instead, we will publicly fund the candidates, and they may not ask for nor may they accept contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.714" offset="10833338">Just as in 1976 there is no record evidence of corruption, there is none in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.784" offset="10857684">The district court exhaustively examined the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.736" offset="10869491">The record consisted of more than 200 stipulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.788" offset="10881717">And it noted the complete absence of any real or apparent corruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.009" offset="10914527">It found little more than what it considered things to be in the mainstream of American political tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.114" offset="10947023">But the Democrats apparently were concerned that there was no evidence of direct corruption, so what they tried to do was persuade the lower court that there was an appearance of corruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.041" offset="10998641">And they tried to do that through a poll, a public opinion poll.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.724" offset="11009403">The lower court discussed this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.794" offset="11033645">It properly rejected that poll because, in its view... and we hope it is this Court's view as well:</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.115" offset="11063007">"The constitutionality of legislation ought not to turn on a national plebiscite. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3025.021" offset="12242592">Justice Rehnquist, a while ago you were asking questions about this Court's Right to Work opinion and whether or not it simply controls this case and resolves the issue altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.961" offset="12274357">It does not, for two reasons:</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.611" offset="12280940">First, as Mr. Feirson pointed out, the FEC has a regulation which says that political committees may incorporate and yet still avoid the proscriptions on corporate expenditures contained in 441(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.923" offset="12342171">They may incorporate for liability purposes only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.125" offset="12355023">And two, the statute which is before this Court today restricts expenditures by political committees, which are defined in the Fund Act and in the Federal Election Campaign Act as including groups incorporated or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.717" offset="12413433">So that this case, albeit with an unincorporated political committee, would be before this Court today if this Court viewed the FEC's regulation as not disposing of that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.346" offset="12487934">Your Honors, throughout the FEC's and DNC's briefs they refer to us as being a nominally independent, professionally run, effective; that the candidate knows who is helping him and why.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.371" offset="12551986">At one point one of the Appellants refers to the ability of groups like Appellees to exert significant influence on the political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.377" offset="12584065">We think that these are all code words for saying that we're effective and that, because we're effective, our speech ought to be choked off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.500" offset="12620531">We do not understand the law to permit that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.471" offset="12640385">Mr. Steele suggested in his argument that the messages of the publicly funded candidates are somehow being interfered with by the independent expenditures engaged in by Appellees here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.330" offset="12699839">We are not aware that anybody in America feels that the candidates were not able to get their messages across.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.800" offset="12725753">They also refer to our expenditures as a mere subsidy or a supplement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.554" offset="12752711">Those too are code words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.173" offset="12763160">They suggest that we are somehow coordinated with the publicly funded candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.244" offset="12787506">That is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.179" offset="12795238">In fact, in 1980 Common Cause and the Carter-Mondale committee filed administrative complaints against both Appellees here and, after almost three years of investigation, the FEC came up empty-handed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.004" offset="12842572">It took no action against us whatsoever on the coordination claims or on any other claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.640" offset="12865038">The fact is, we're not coordinated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.044" offset="12886667">Finally and perhaps most importantly, Mr. Steele suggests that because of Appellees and their independent expenditures the candidates might somehow be beholden to our Appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.702" offset="12941315">First of all, there's no record whatever... no record evidence whatever on that score.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.756" offset="12961586">Secondly, please consider what Mr. Steele is really suggesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.827" offset="12981857">What he is saying is that, because our candidates... our clients, who pool small contributions of many ordinary citizens, citizens of ordinary means, and spend those in support of a candidate, that those expenditures might cause the candidate to pay attention to those voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.875" offset="13074017">Well, that is the American way, as we understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.077" offset="13086869">What Mr. Steele is really concerned about is that these expenditures might be effective, and that a candidate might realize that the voters are getting his message and would be responsive to those voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.135" offset="13143085">Well, that is the point of the process as we understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.522" offset="13160639">In short, it seems to be Appellants' position that groups like NCPAC and PCM and their many contributors are better see and not heard; that they are to troop to the polls obediently every election day and vote and go home; that they can participate through the party process, but through no other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.369" offset="13247993">We think that in this case silence is not golden, that this statute was not intended by Congress to reach independent expenditures, but if it was it can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.077" offset="13290833">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles N. Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="3294.933" offset="13322285">I would like first to deal with the issue of the statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.318" offset="13343810">We have set forth in our reply briefs in footnotes 2 and 3 where we think that that was dealt with by Appellees in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.006" offset="13378500">It seems to us that they effectively conceded that the statute covers their expenditures, not only in their papers to the district court below, but in their answer to the complaint, which stated that the expenditures they would make... it was also their statement in the advisory opinion request that they sought from the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.404" offset="13456136">With regard to the point relating to the statutory history and to the intention of Congress, again our reply brief sets forth at some length, as well as our opening brief does, the discussions that were held in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.179" offset="13519248">It seems very clear to me that, first of all, the term "independent expenditures" was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.702" offset="13549341">I would note that 608(e), but that that was clearly the import of what this Court dealt with in Buckley versus Valeo, 608(e) having been the broad expenditure limit that was struck down by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.510" offset="13600541">But the discussion in Congress related to the question of private money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.814" offset="13621753">There was considerable discussion about contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.516" offset="13632620">There was considerable discussions about expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.218" offset="13643382">So that the concept that Congress did not understand that these kinds of expenditures would come forth in a publicly financed system, one where there was an expenditure limitation on the candidate, expenditure limitations on his party, prohibition of private contributions to the candidate, limitations of contributions to the party, seems to me one that is totally at odds with the nature of Congress as experts who know a great deal about campaign financing, who discussed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.618" offset="13756962">Senator Gore in 1967, when he raised the whole question about the efficacy of the Long Act and said, rejecting one of the arguments that I think is made in favor of what this statute could have been, said about the Long Act: Well, that will only be a subsidy, listed explicitly nine points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.514" offset="13824567">The second of those nine points was precisely that expenditures would be made by unauthorized committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.067" offset="13846824">The whole debate that led to the Honest Elections Act of 1967 that was reported out was dealing with the question of how do we deal with unaccountable expenditures?</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.106" offset="13886948">It was the form of the complaint that was made against the statute as it had passed in 1966, and that was the statute that was carried forth to 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.931" offset="13934282">Finally, I would say that, with regard to the question of whether everything is a code word for effectiveness, I think that it is indeed true that what Congress was aiming at in Section 9012(f) was committees who would be able to conduct the kind of national campaign that cost millions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.012" offset="14022576">There is no question that what it sought to prohibit was political committees, precisely because they were able to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.766" offset="14049534">That does not mean to me, and I should think that it would not mean to this Court, that what Congress was there intending to do was to cut off the individual's rights of speech and association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.574" offset="14092793">Individuals are protected in their volunteer activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.193" offset="14103242">They're protected under the statute here in terms of making expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.312" offset="14119751">There are a variety of ways in which Congress has dealt with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.930" offset="14134275">So that the answer with regard to the effectiveness is, yes, precisely the reason that Congress saw these independent committees, who could not be found to be not independent in the course of the election, the danger that it--</text>

            <text syncTime="3579.301" offset="14459761">Again, I think that was the precise balance that Congress was really concerned about in all of these debates, was how to get a handle on limiting the large aggregations of wealth that came into political committees and the expenditure of those, without interfering with the rights of individuals, small groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.647" offset="14541054">A long discussion about the Pastore amendment, about groups of Columbia University professors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.099" offset="14558922">I've never known why they chose that as the hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.734" offset="14569475">But that was the precise balance that Congress was trying to make, how to reach the aggregations through political committees, but not interfere with the individuals' and small groups' rights to have some influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.875" offset="14618063">It would not be sufficient to mount a national campaign, but it was precise those shadow campaigns, as we have spoken of them, that Congress was concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.797" offset="14649723">If you don't limit unauthorized political committees in their expenditures, Congress felt you would have those kinds of campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.201" offset="14679294">And as we've set forth in our brief and again as is mentioned, that seems to have come true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.355" offset="14703953">Here you have a statute that prohibits it, that the Commission has said has prohibited these activities for a long time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3648.709" offset="14737390">If there was not that prohibition, some 8,000 political committees could do the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.429" offset="14760273">The size of that is considerably larger than the public fund, whatever the public fund.</text>
