            <text syncTime="13.386" offset="170422">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, on the night of October 4, 1980, an Oklahoma City police officer named Julian Rotramel shot and killed a man named William Tuttle.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.880" offset="228414">The shooting occurred outside a bar in Oklahoma City called the "We'll Do Club".</text>
            <text syncTime="35.517" offset="258925">The bar was located in what Plaintiff's expert called an interstitial city area, what he described as a rough part of town.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.998" offset="300825">The events leading up to the shooting are unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.777" offset="327992">The evidence was that Mr. Tuttle was a frequent patron of the bar, and that day he had been in and out of it several different times, He was said to be despondent over a quarrel he had had with his wife, and his despondency had caused him on a previous occasion following a quarrel with his wife to slash his wrist in the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.032" offset="433005">He was... he called the Oklahoma City Police Department and reported an armed robbery in progress and described to the dispatcher the armed robber as himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.086" offset="513253">He said,</text>
            <text syncTime="99.617" offset="515343">"He's a white male. "</text>
            <text syncTime="100.600" offset="519313">"He's about 37 years old. "</text>
            <text syncTime="102.335" offset="526210">"He has glasses, brown hair. "</text>
            <text syncTime="105.613" offset="539375">and such as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.363" offset="542301">The dispatcher put out an all-points bulletin to all officers, and there were two officers patrolling separately in the general vicinity of the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.718" offset="591725">One of them was Julian Rotramel, a rookie police officer who had been out of the Oklahoma City Police Academy about ten months following an 18-week training exercise at the Oklahoma City Police Academy.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.945" offset="668629">He was 22 years old at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.773" offset="679914">Another officer patrolling in the general vicinity was a veteran police officer named Lennox.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.675" offset="703529">Rotramel arrived on the scene almost within one minute after he received the call.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.016" offset="736965">He was within eight or nine blocks of the club.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.030" offset="752952">What happened after he went into the club is in sharp dispute in the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.839" offset="780224">Rotramel's testimony was that he walked into the darkened bar... it was a so-called "blind" building, concrete blocks, with a single door that operated on a trap spring that closed behind you... and found the person later found to be Tuttle; in any event, the person who matched the description of the robber at the bar, and that Tuttle walked toward him as if to leave through the door behind him.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.904" offset="908538">Rotramel said that he put his hand on his shirt or arm or chest, and anyway he held him, and that Tuttle said something that's in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.946" offset="964649">Why can't I leave, or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.961" offset="976665">And Rotramel replies,</text>
            <text syncTime="217.069" offset="985129">"I've got a call. "</text>
            <text syncTime="217.881" offset="988368">"Stay put. "</text>
            <text syncTime="218.428" offset="990562">It's Rotramel's testimony that Tuttle tried twice to reach for his boot, and that he straightened him up.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.203" offset="1045733">The two bartenders, female bartenders in the bar, testified they saw Tuttle make no such action to retrieve anything from his boot.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.684" offset="1083558">Rotramel lighted his flashlight, it was dark in there, and signaled to the bartender to come toward him.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.805" offset="1128071">His testimony was he asked if there was a robbery in progress, and that she uttered only one word, "robbery", and it doesn't indicate whether it was with a question mark like "robbery"?</text>
            <text syncTime="264.784" offset="1176032">or whether it was "robbery".</text>
            <text syncTime="265.845" offset="1180211">It's not clear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.142" offset="1185436">In any event, it does seem to be clear that Tuttle then broke loose from the officer's grasp and in the words of the Plaintiff's witnesses, darted through the door and that Rotramel spun around and went through the door after him, in pursuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.477" offset="1286791">And whether the door slammed shut or was propped open by the officer's foot is also disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.020" offset="1312913">In any event, at some point in whirling after him, the officer drew his service revolver.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.923" offset="1336528">Outside the bar, there was no witness other than Rotramel.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.389" offset="1362441">He said that he saw Tuttle down in a crouched position with his hand going for his boot.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.995" offset="1400894">He saw no weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.026" offset="1404969">He said he had hollered "halt" when the man went out, and "halt" when he saw him crouched with his hand in his boot, and that Tuttle looked over his shoulder at him and started to come up, and he fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.472" offset="1474768">It was Plaintiff's version that because of the exit wound on Tuttle, it could not have happened the way Rotramel said it happened, because the bullet exited higher than it entered in the back.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.871" offset="1544358">So he must have been in a bent-over position.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.465" offset="1554703">So, in any event, he didn't come straight up.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.120" offset="1561390">He was still in a crouched position.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.816" offset="6424136">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is an appeal from the jury verdict rendered in the Western District of Oklahoma, as affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.219" offset="6465723">The issue before this Court is not whether the City of Oklahoma City should have to pay damages to the estate of William Adam Tuttle; the overall question of liability depends on a number of issues which are simply not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.869" offset="6528312">First, liability depends in large part upon resolution of factual issues which were resolved by the jury in the case and are subject to limited review, due to the provisions of the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.347" offset="6590275">Second, most of the legal issues were addressed in instructions given by the Court which were simply either unobjected to or objected to in such a way as to be insufficient under Rule 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.279" offset="6649939">And, third, any other issues, other issues that have been discussed here this morning simply aren't raised by the cert petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.900" offset="6684420">In this case, the policy, the case was submitted to the jury in the court's instructions on three separate theories; one, that the shooting itself was justified under the policies of the City of Oklahoma City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.831" offset="6756205">As I was interested in Mr. Bailey's concession that if they'd a shoot to kill, shoot on suspicion policy, that that would have been... would not have passed constitutional muster and would have been a basis for liability, and that's precisely what the evidence showed at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.604" offset="6827258">The chief of police testified, and it was a matter of evidence, it was a matter of factual issue that was resolved against the City, that the officer was entitled to shoot on the basis of suspicion, if he had any suspicion that his life was in danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.192" offset="6889638">Very briefly, the facts, as opposed to being in a light most favorable to the City, in a light most favorable to Mr. Tuttle, who prevailed in the trial court, showed that Mr. Rotramel did go into the bar and was advised... was not a dark bar, but it was a well-lit bar... that he was advised upon entering the bar, he asked about an armed robbery, the bartender, another bartender advised him that there was no armed robbery in progress.</text>
