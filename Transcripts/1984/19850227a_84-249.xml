            <text syncTime="1286.702" offset="5274657">Well, this Court has held that the Supremacy Clause itself does not grant rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.106" offset="5292316">What it does is that it secures rights which the Constitution otherwise grants or that Congress has granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.160" offset="5316453">In this instance the Court on analogous cases has found that the Supremacy Clause should not be given the broad, expansive reading that the taxpayer does here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.932" offset="5355532">And the cases that we have cited in our brief show various instances in which a state court has declined to receive a federal claim, and that this Court has found those actions to be proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.839" offset="5403180">The cases that seem to be most telling are those of Douglas v. New York, Herb v. Pitcairn, and Missouri ex rel Southern Railway v. Mayfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.381" offset="5441423">The last case cited in particular says that the doctrine of forum nonconvenience, which is purely one that the state had adopted at its convenience for the parties, is one that the state may use and refuse to hear a federal cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.141" offset="5500460">We think that in this instance the Supremacy Clause would not demand that the state of South Carolina entertain the 1983 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.127" offset="5532329">The question that must be asked is does the state rule that is being applied, is it applied neutrally, or does it single out federal causes of action and prohibit the state from hearing those?</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.285" offset="5581021">We think that the correct application of that rule in South Carolina is that we have a neutral rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.291" offset="5609025">The neutral rule that we use is the subject matter jurisdiction of our own courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.093" offset="5628251">Our courts have jurisdiction over tax matters only in those instances in which the taxpayer brings an action paid under protest and then sues within 30 days to recover his money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.468" offset="5673704">That is not an unusual position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.353" offset="5685302">This Court has recognized such an argument in the case of Testa v. Katt and Mondou v. New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.589" offset="5710171">In those particular cases this Court has said that the federal claim need not be heard unless its ordinary jurisdiction as prescribed by local law is appropriate to the occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.131" offset="5752385">Well, what is the ordinary jurisdiction in South Carolina which is appropriate to the occasion?</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.368" offset="5773283">Well, here our courts have held in at least three specific cases that if the courts did not have jurisdiction over declaratory judgments, it does not have jurisdiction over injunctive relief; it has jurisdiction only over those cases where there is a payment under protest, and an action is brought to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.145" offset="5840470">So in this instance we think South Carolina has applied a very neutral rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.364" offset="5857292">It excludes all state actions, and it likewise would exclude all federal actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1496.105" offset="6112248">And we submit to the Court that they have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.491" offset="6121861">The question is not can they; the question is have they done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.176" offset="6136594">Well, in this particular instance, the first thing that we look at is the literal language of 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.032" offset="6163970">Well, on the face of that statute, it does not say that one must hear these actions in state court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1595.570" offset="6510145">One of the primary purposes that this Court found that Monroe v. Pape said that 1983 was enacted for was to provide a federal remedy in a federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1918.731" offset="7802788">In addition to that, the Congress recognized that states required exhaustion of administration remedies before they could proceed to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.753" offset="7834866">In a similar type of atmosphere, this Court in Smith v. Robinson and in Middlesex v. Sea Clammers has found that where Congress knew of a particular remedy, there is an intent that Congress wanted that remedy to be used, and that 1983 not necessarily be the remedy that the individual could pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.933" offset="7923578">We think a similar approach is warranted in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.654" offset="7938520">Since Congress was well aware of the states' remedies, it recognized those remedies, and therefore, there is an intent for Congress to say that the 1983 remedy was not required to be used in state tax disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.913" offset="7995467">Further pursuing that line of argument, for a moment let's look at what might happen if 1983 is allowed into the state tax system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.936" offset="8035591">First of all, it seems to me that it does violence to the very purposes for which 28 U.S.C. 1341 was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.458" offset="8073730">The purpose behind 1341 was to prohibit the disruption of state and county finances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.481" offset="8101733">And, in fact, what was happening was that foreign corporations would be able to establish diversity jurisdiction, thereby entering into federal court, obtain an injunction, and would, in effect, be litigating with the state on the basis of injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.657" offset="8162442">The corporation would not have to pay the taxes up front, and the state would be denied the use of the revenues during the entire time of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.429" offset="8197550">Well, some of the very large corporations in fact, for lack of a better word, were sort of holding the states hostage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.500" offset="8225867">They were using this as a weapon to compromise the amount of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.702" offset="8242690">Well, if 1983 is now available in the state court for state taxes, the same result can occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.975" offset="8267768">He may came into state court, simply say I do not wish to pay the tax on various constitutional grounds, and then obtain an injunction from the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.913" offset="8303503">The taxpayers say well, he could not get an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.198" offset="8320639">Well, to me that's a rather anomalous argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.150" offset="8332447">On one hand he is saying to the court I don't have to recognize the existence of adequate state remedies when I come into court under 1983, but once I am in the court under 1983, I recognize that I cannot get an injunction because there's an adequate state remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.260" offset="8396917">That seems somewhat circular to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.611" offset="8406321">If he comes into court under 1993, he brings in all of the attributes of 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.115" offset="8428264">The very language of the statute says that it may be filed in suits of equity as well as it law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.752" offset="8450834">If he can file them in equity, then he is able to obtain injunctions in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.371" offset="8469328">So he will be defeating the very purpose for which 1341 was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.191" offset="8488659">Secondly, under 1341 Congress was well aware of the need for states to have exhaustion of administrative remedies--</text>

            <text syncTime="2120.376" offset="8609345">Well, if the intent of Congress is expressed in 1341, to prevent the very things that 1983 can be used for in the state court, that negates any sort of intent that Congress required states to hear these actions in their own courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.636" offset="8670367">The administrative exhaustion remedy would do great violence to states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.724" offset="8698788">Many times taxes are resolved, disputes are resolved before proceeding to the courts due to administration exhaustion requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.931" offset="8739539">Well, as this Court has found in Patsy, the administration, exhaustion of administrative remedies need not be pursued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.018" offset="8767960">That sort of idea, when expressed in terms of state taxes, would lead to a great deal of confusion and unnecessary burden to the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.893" offset="8807457">Again, that is a reason why Congress did not intend to make 1983 mandatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="2257.248" offset="9156871">But in both instances the state already has its money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.716" offset="9170768">One of the additional points that we think is important for deciding: did Congress require states to hear 1983 actions is that of there being the requirement of a clear statement when Congress wishes to intrude into a fundamental state area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.262" offset="9248927">I cannot conceive of a more fundamental area than the ability of a state to raise its own taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.518" offset="9273900">If that is the case, then where is the clear statement in 1983 that it is to be made mandatory upon the state?</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.522" offset="9301903">I do not believe that there is a clear statement to that effect in 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.991" offset="9323846">And in a similar vein, when Congress seeks to waive the sovereign immunity of a state, it also must do so by clear language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.097" offset="9360208">Well, in this particular instance, this Court in Quern v. Jordan has found that 1983 does not contain a clear statement necessary to waive the state sovereign immunity in a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.089" offset="9412244">That decision, of course, is based on the Eleventh Amendment, and at is of course recognized that the Eleventh Amendment is not applicable in state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.695" offset="9446621">But the Eleventh Amendment does contain the very germ of truth which is critical to this case; that is, that states retain sovereign immunity when it is going to be sued in its own court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.402" offset="9493433">The state ought to have the right to not be sued in its own court unless Congress has clearly said you may be sued in your own courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.524" offset="9530004">Well, the effect of Quern v. Jordan is to 'say there is not a clear statement in 1983 to waive sovereign immunity because it is not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.364" offset="9565322">We think the same rule applies in the state court, that the state is not to be sued unless that statement is in the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.386" offset="9593430">In summary, what we would like to present to this Court are basically two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.724" offset="9618716">First of all, in order for 1983 to be found to be mandatory upon the states, there has to be either a constitutional source for that rule, or there has to be congressional authority for that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.514" offset="9669916">The Constitution does not provide that source, because that source has been presented to this Court as being the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.418" offset="9697501">The Supremacy Clause itself does not mandate that states hear 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.505" offset="9721848">All that it requires is that they apply federal law when they are hearing the particular claims of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.345" offset="9749224">And South Carolina has done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.278" offset="9756956">They applied the federal privileges and immunities provisions of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.432" offset="9777541">Secondly, in order for 1983 to become mandatory in the state tax system, there has to be congressional direction to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.954" offset="9815679">The legislative history, the literal language of 1983 does not support such a contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.210" offset="9840652">It is our view that 1983 in a state tax matter was never intended by Congress, and in fact, there are adequate remedies in the state which provide the taxpayer to vindicate any and all constitutional rights that he may have.</text>

            <text syncTime="2518.528" offset="10201978">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.278" offset="10205008">The supreme court said the trial court did not address the Section 1983 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.063" offset="10224130">The supreme court did this not because of any analysis of Testa v. Katt or the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.419" offset="10249521">It simply noted that this Court had not yet ruled on that precise issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.954" offset="10263627">In response to the Respondent's contention that this is not a Section 1983 case, Congress has clearly made Section 1983 available when there are deprivations of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.547" offset="10322037">I don't think Congress should be required to make a specific list of all the possible deprivations of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.201" offset="10344711">1983 could not be any more clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.069" offset="10356101">Also, as this Court noted in Maine v. Thiboutot, Congress intended for fees to be available in state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.557" offset="10386089">This Court pointed out that if fees were not available in state courts, federalism concerns would be raised, because there are 1983 cases which cannot be brought into federal courts, and those 1983 plaintiffs would be forced to come into state court without the attorney's fees that Congress meant for those plaintiffs to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.201" offset="10460695">The Respondents have attempted to expand the intent of Congress in the Tax Injunction Act far beyond what the legislative history indicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.409" offset="10497475">The Tax Injunction Act is not like the statutes the Court faced in Sea Clammers and Smith v. Robinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.146" offset="10524434">It is a very short bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.598" offset="10534256">It had only one purpose, and that was to deprive federal district courts of jurisdiction in certain kinds of cases under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.454" offset="10569678">Congress was not trying to create a comprehensive remedial scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.006" offset="10587859">Our arguments regarding injunctions not being available in state court any more than they already are are based on Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.845" offset="10623281">Congress has not attempted to alter the equitable principles which governed the availability of injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.665" offset="10646478">Therefore, if 1983 actions are available in state court, those same principles will apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.903" offset="10671451">Exhaustion is not an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.557" offset="10686079">Although Respondents have fears of exhaustion and circumvention of state remedies, that is not the question before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.877" offset="10719412">There was no failure to exhaust here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.596" offset="10730279">The Court can address that in a future case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2653.698" offset="10742608">If I understood your friend correctly, he suggested... and maybe I didn't understand him correctly... that 1983 actions in the state courts are in the category of cases that the state court can take or leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.307" offset="10801123">They can enforce 1983 or they can refuse to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2672.028" offset="10815960">I think that is what the Respondents have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.996" offset="10831843">The Supreme Court of South Carolina has said that 1983 is not available whenever it supplements the remedies that are available under state law, which would render 1983 redundant in most cases, and deprive people like the Spencers of the attorney's fees that Congress meant for the Spencers to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.025" offset="10899970">The Respondents have raised an issue of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.660" offset="10914494">This Court has ruled in Hutto v. Finney that there is no sovereign immunity problem regarding the availability of attorney's fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2703.380" offset="10941348">Well, as Justice Marshall suggested, probably Congress in enacting 1983 wasn't thinking about banks and bankers so much as it was thinking about some other people.</text>

            <text syncTime="2714.438" offset="10985652">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.471" offset="10989727">Including people like the Spencers, as this Court pointed out in Monroe v. Pape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.442" offset="11009580">And the issues regarding whether sovereign immunity had been pierced by Section 1983 are not really in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.365" offset="11045315">The Spencers obtained a declaratory judgment despite the state's argument that there was no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.852" offset="11071229">The state supreme court in this case affirmed a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.773" offset="11090977">As this Court noted in Pullian v. Allen, Congress clearly meant for people like the Spencers to have attorney's fees, even though some doctrine of immunity might bar damages relief or other types of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.730" offset="11142804">If there are no... oh, I would like to address one further point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.348" offset="11157224">In cases where Congress' intent is unclear about the obligation of state courts, Testa makes the rule clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.121" offset="11184391">In Testa v. Katt and Mondou there was no specific ruling, by Congress of whether the state courts were required to enforce the federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.810" offset="11219082">This Court ruled in both cases that the Supremacy Clause answered the question in those cases and required the state court to enforce them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.648" offset="11250429">The refusal to enforce the Spencers' federal rights in this case is not based on a lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.451" offset="11273626">It is based on state policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.736" offset="11282821">The Supremacy Clause does not permit the legislature of South Carolina to instruct its courts to award only the remedies that the state legislature wishes plaintiffs to have.</text>

            <text syncTime="2813.202" offset="11380623">My argument is not based on discernible intent to require states to entertain them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.756" offset="11402879">My argument is based on Congress, intent that 1983 actions be available in state courts, and then applying the rule of Testa that when Congress has given state courts concurrent jurisdiction over a federal cause of action, without making any sore findings state courts are obligated to enforce those federal causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.884" offset="11475395">That is a well-established principle, and I think Congress follows it when it enacts federal causes of action.</text>
