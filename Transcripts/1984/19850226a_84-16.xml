            <text syncTime="82.654" offset="467239">This case is here on appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.522" offset="486674">The lower court held invalid a leasing regulation of the California State Lands Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.776" offset="511647">That regulation authorized the negotiation of rent for leases of state property based upon the volume of commodities crossing the leased land.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.983" offset="552502">The regulation did not prescribe rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.435" offset="566295">The lower court concluded that such a form of rent, regardless of amount, constitutes an unreasonable burden on commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.577" offset="610912">It further concluded that such a form of rent constituted a tariff when used with regard to lessees engaged in interstate or foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.949" offset="652395">And, finally the Ninth Circuit held that the Commission was limited in recovering on its ground leases not a return on its ground leases but only a recovery of the cost, its out-of-pocket costs, when charging rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.410" offset="726269">This is a remarkable decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.798" offset="743823">The decision accords second class status to the state as a lessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.135" offset="769110">It means that the state in many instances will be constrained to take less in the way of rent than would another lessor in similar circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.443" offset="818324">Do you think the result would have been the same under the reasoning of the Court of Appeals if the measurement had not been related to traveling over California territory but simply a percentage of the volume of material taken out?</text>

            <text syncTime="185.936" offset="880287">Well, of course, Your Honor, this is one fact that we would like to drive home to the maximum extent possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.791" offset="911738">The charge is not made merely for the entry of goods into the political jurisdiction of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.529" offset="930651">It is tied explicitly only to those parcels of property limited in number which are made... privately appropriated by the lessees to their own use for commercial gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.539" offset="986762">I really don't know what type of rent the Ninth Circuit would have considered permissible other than a non-variable, flat annual rent such as the Commission also charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.696" offset="1039320">There is a final line tossed off in the opinion concerning this is not to say that all forms of volumetric rent are forbidden, but there is really no analytical clue in the decision of the Ninth Circuit concerning what type of variable rent it would have found permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.058" offset="1112777">It seems to me the thrust of the Ninth Circuit's decision is that any form of variable rent, at least with regard to the state and when it deals with interstate or foreign lessees, any such variable rent is prohibited to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.781" offset="1367732">In fact, it is so different that we don't see there is any application in this case because it does deal with taxes and this Court in Michelin versus Wages, for instance, that even with regard to taxes the question there is what type of taxes?</text>
            <text syncTime="320.256" offset="1417573">Is it merely for the privilege of entry or is it tied to some service the government provides?</text>
            <text syncTime="324.725" offset="1435441">We submit it is an a fortiori case, if you will, when you are talking not about a tax at all but a form of rental.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.914" offset="1464280">What the decision in effect calls for is a subsidy, a subsidy to these oil companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.484" offset="1494478">The decision is also unfair to the other lessees of the Commission because what this ruling of the Ninth Circuit means is that certain lessees, among them these oil companies, are entitled to special treatment and these other lessees, the lessees of the state that are engaged in intrastate commerce, yes, they may be asked to pay a variable rent, whereas this special class, they cannot be asked to pay such a rent.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.423" offset="1722266">Cases of this Court are not all that clear that you have got to have competitors in order to avail yourself of a doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="518.100" offset="2208979">Well, the Court of Appeals realized that really the issue was the form or mode of rent rather than amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.640" offset="2247118">But, what seemed to bother the Court of Appeals was not so much the initial lease where at time one there is no lease at all and the question is should the oil company enter into the lease based on volumetric rental.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.964" offset="2304483">That situation, at least in terms of what the Court said, didn't seem to bother it.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.102" offset="2320992">What it focused on was this renewal context where you have a refinery... and there are some of them with internal leases that do involve this situation... a refinery on the upland, hard by the wharf site that is leased from the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.794" offset="2379715">And, what the Court seemed to be concerned about was a perceived potential for the state demanding and getting extortionate rents.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.317" offset="2417854">Now, I think there are some ready answers to that concern of the Ninth Circuit, but we don't think analysis under the commerce clause provides answers to those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.275" offset="2461635">First, if indeed there is a potential for extortionate rents, that concern, it seems to us, applies regardless of the form of rent that you are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.582" offset="2510955">It applies as well that type of concern with a flat annual rent based on a stated percentage of fee value.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.319" offset="2533838">What if the stated percentage proposed by the state is 90 percent?</text>
            <text syncTime="602.938" offset="2548362">The oil companies certainly would be taking issue with that kind of proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.425" offset="2570305">So, it is not really the mode of rent, it is the amount, regardless of mode, that could present a problem in those situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1969.951" offset="8016417">Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.486" offset="8030524">Let me start with this point, I think, and sort of pick up where we were a minute ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.425" offset="8070230">As successors to the English Crown, the original 13 states, we are thought generally considered to have acquired the tide and submerged lands underlying the harbors and the rivers of each of their states from the moment when those 13 states were formed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.755" offset="8155598">It also, I think, has not been disputed on this record, and I don't believe can be, that as the other states joined the Union they came to acquire similar rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.913" offset="8196244">If one needs to have a citation, one is Shively v. Bolby at 153 U.S., but there are many cases that state that proposition and I won't belabor it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.752" offset="8235637">Now, the second point, one has this basic picture that the states started out owning the tide and submerged lands that underlay the harbors and the adjacent coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.678" offset="8295301">Now let me say that in U.S. v. California it was established they didn't own out to the three mile limit, but Congress promptly in effect reversed that decision with the Submerged Lands Act and it has since been clear... and this, I believe, corresponds pretty well to the general thinking about the law at an earlier date... that they had this band that borders along the ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.294" offset="8385789">Now that is the first basic proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.829" offset="8395924">A second basic proposition is that the commerce clause, the import/export clause and the tonnage clause were of fundamental importance in the very adoption of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.903" offset="8448169">Every historian that I have read and many of the cases of this Court including Michelin Tire and others, speak strongly of the fact that in the years of the Articles of Confederation, the first ten years roughly of the Republic, they are proliferated, there grew a bale of assorted tariffs, barriers, and restraints of one kind or another that the states adopted not only with respect to foreign imports but with respect to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.823" offset="8559869">And, the Constitutional Convention was caused preeminently because of disagreement and through that condition and dissatisfaction with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.845" offset="8595918">And, one of the fundamental objectives of the founders was to end it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.797" offset="8611800">Now, those founders were lawyers and if one looks at the basic characteristics of the charges we are dealing with here, one has to say that if the state's interpretation is correct, then it must have been intended by the founders that those provisions which were so important be totally ineffective, because the facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.663" offset="8707200">If one wishes to import any commodity, if one wishes to bring it in interstate commerce by transportation by vessel, one is going to have to have a dock, some sort of facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.570" offset="8758817">It can't fly through the air from the ship into the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.290" offset="8773760">Today petroleum, which wasn't thought of then, is one of the major commodities that moves in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.378" offset="8802076">It is a major commodity that moves in vast quantities into the coast of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.865" offset="8827990">California, as it happens, uses about two million barrels a day of petroleum and it only produces something on the order of 800,000 from the internal sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.221" offset="8865502">Today it is commencing to produce a great deal on the outer continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.442" offset="8886400">All of that requires pipeline transportation and that pipeline has to be laid in tide and submerged land and quantitatively most of that land belongs to the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.986" offset="8952542">The numbers are in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.169" offset="8957244">They come to 93 percent of the total if you include... If you exclude the cities.</text>

Let me say as I go further in that connection that one of my puzzles in this connection has been the degree to which this case raises issues of the Montana Power and the Louisiana v.

            <text syncTime="2981.965" offset="12064457">And, similarly, while I see no such concession as to commerce, I see no connected argument anywhere that this kind of a charge is all right under the commerce clause and I hesitate, therefore, to embark on a debate that may not be before this Court at this time at all and yet I am a little concerned that if I say nothing on it the subject may be the subject of a decision to which I have contributed very little because one hesitates to answer an argument that hasn't been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.103" offset="12189009">Let me say, therefore, simply these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.657" offset="12207190">That is it is my belief that the Court's most recent cases recognize the necessity of preserving something like the doctrine of the user tax cases here, to start with Evansville which says that the charge of one dollar per passenger at an airport was all right because it didn't exceed cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.920" offset="12296215">It is a 1972 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.105" offset="12304992">It is a relatively modern decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.688" offset="12311366">To continue, in Montana Power this Court speaks of the invalidity of a tax which bears no relationship to the taxpayer's activities and it goes forward and refers to Nippert v. Richmond and Michigan-Wisconsin Pipeline v. Calvert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.451" offset="12394435">Now, both of those cases were cases where impractical operation they taxed more severely on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.290" offset="12425782">And, let me say simply that if one looks at the Army Engineers' statistics that our friends and the others have cited, it will practically appear that quite literally when it comes to crude oil this law has its application essentially 100 percent to imports and to interstate commerce and as to products it must be in the order of 90 percent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3379.036" offset="13652702">And this is pretty much that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.904" offset="13664195">So, I would conclude that that doctrine arranged an essential there as to interstate commerce as well as foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.546" offset="13718739">It seems to me that the use of title as a vehicle for the imposition of creation of a barrier, however small, at the state border is just as undesirable for interstate commerce as it is for foreign and I note that in Michelin Tire this Court has sought to amalgamate the concepts of the import/export clause and the commerce clause to the extent feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.315" offset="13837857">In that case what was done was to take commerce clause ideas and apply them to the import/export clause, but I would submit as one looks at the necessity of a protection against a true sort of barrier at the border that the same logic applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.078" offset="13920927">Let me add that there are plenty of situations that illustrate the necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.315" offset="13945795">It is a fact, for instance, that oil from Alaska comes ashore in Long Beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.369" offset="13970037">It then is put into what is known as the four-corner pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.273" offset="13989681">It traverses the City of Los Angeles, it crosses the state's highways, it crosses the land of probably a hundred or a thousand maybe assorted cities and counties as it goes between Los Angeles and Midland, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.382" offset="14050076">And, every time it crosses a street or a highway, it is crossing some state's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.686" offset="14071288">If the rule is that the state... I say simply that if the rule is that the state can charge anything it wants for the use of its property, then I submit we will be back in the same situation as a peddlar in the Middle Ages.</text>

            <text syncTime="3510.421" offset="14178285">I was able to find the reference to the Corps of Engineers' report.</text>

            <text syncTime="3521.292" offset="14221753">published in August 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.494" offset="14230530">That report indicates there are approximately 1513 miles of coastline including the interior bays in California and of that amount 418 miles is in the ownership, the frontage, of local public entities pursuant to grants from the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.771" offset="14303673">Now, of course, that 418 figures doesn't include the frontage that is owned by private parties and I just don't have a figure for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.759" offset="14323631">I should also say that the proportion of local cities to state ownership is probably even greater if we focus on what is desirable or useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.483" offset="14366471">That northerly 350 miles between San Francisco and the Oregon border really is not necessary or needed for this type of lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.321" offset="14393848">Second, I do want to clarify... and I can do it by reference to the record... that we are not talking about a volumetric charge here that is added on to an eight percent return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.529" offset="14434703">This is just like a percentage lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.179" offset="14445257">There is a minimum rent, but that minimum rent is applied as a credit against the volumetric rent and you very well may have situations where all that is paid is the minimum rent because the volume has not been sufficient enough to generate a volumetric rent over the minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.323" offset="14513906">The citations to the record for this are to two leases that talk about the minimum application at page 42 of the Joint Appendix, also page 64, a Union and a Standard lease, and also in the affidavit of the Commission at pages--</text>
