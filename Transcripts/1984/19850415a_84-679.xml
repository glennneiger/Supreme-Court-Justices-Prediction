            <text syncTime="93.262" offset="507529">The case arose in the context of a suit before the United States District Court in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.107" offset="538876">A Judge Schwarzer dismissed the action on motion on the basis of the following critical allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.363" offset="575865">The Plaintiffs alleged that they had invested in a company known as TONM that was engaged in exploration for gold in Surinam.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.152" offset="627065">They said that they did so by obtaining information directly or indirectly through the Defendant broker of a number of matters, but the following was the essential point, and that was that there was a developed gold find in Surinam, and that there would shortly be announced a joint venture with a major mining company in order to exploit that gold find.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.829" offset="741795">The complaint recites that they were told that this was inside information obtained from a president or a vice president of TONM.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.157" offset="787039">They said that they purchased shares of stock in TONM over a period of time from November 1979 until 1981 on the premise that this was inside information from that source.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert S. Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="474.972" offset="2034333">The complaint alleges a statement by Mr. Neadeau that the Plaintiffs allege misled them into believing that they had inside information and a jump on every other TONM shareholder in that he made a statement to them that they allege in their complaint... it must be to make it a charging allegation... was a clever confirmation while nonconfirming.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.579" offset="2144779">They said that he said yes, that he couldn't confirm or deny, but the realities were that when he said the reason he couldn't confirm or deny was because the information was not yet public, they would have to wait for that annual report to see that, but he did want to tell them that Mr. Lazzaro was a very trustworthy and good man.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.723" offset="2237357">There is only one inference from that, and if that is not... if that is not an improper transmission by Mr. Neadeau, then in the brokerage industry I believe they are going to talk about somebody being Neadeaulized because that is nothing more than a ploy, at least as they allege it, that's their charge, a ploy to indicate that they had inside information, an unfair jump on the TONM shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.743" offset="2349370">And they say that they acted on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.663" offset="2357102">They say in reliance on it, on the premise that they had inside information, they bought from other shareholders, and they bought at two, they bought with an advance knowledge of market conditions, and they did in fact watch the stock over a period of time from November of 1979 up to the first quarter of 1981, and indeed, in the last quarter of 1980, hit a high water mark of seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.256" offset="2491476">So based upon the information, the jumps that they thought they had, they did indeed have a jump.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.541" offset="2520629">They rode that stock from approximately two up to seven, and had they sold at that point, they would have actually achieved the results of their contemplated fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.749" offset="2573396">They didn't; they held.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.459" offset="2580293">The stock did not pan out.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.001" offset="2590428">A public announcement was made contrary to the inside information announcing that the joint venture wouldn't go through; the stock went down.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.378" offset="2623969">So it is our position that on those facts, as disclosed on the face of the complaint, that Plaintiffs were guilty of a 10(b)(5) violation.</text>

LaHue, however it is correctly pronounced, it was said that when Congress passes such a very general federal tort even for very good and important purposes such as the civil rights statutes, it is presumed to be aware of the common law land the existing of common law defenses and to accept them into that tort structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.999" offset="4638428">This is particularly appropriate with regard to Section 10 because of the savings clauses that are found in Section 16 of the '33 act and 28 of the '34 act which accept common law remedies and deem them to continue in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.940" offset="4710213">The federal courts uniformly, in applying Section 10, have adopted common law defenses based upon the conduct of plaintiffs, for example, laches, waiver, estoppel, ratification, consent, limitations, all of those based upon conduct by the plaintiffs have been accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.793" offset="4797671">One of them has been in pari delicto.</text>

            <label>Mr. Geoffrey P. Knudsen</label>
            <text syncTime="1930.457" offset="7856296">Well, the scope of the fraud, as alleged in the complaint, would have some effect in terms of interpreting whether the Plaintiffs could be considered to be of equal fault or in pari delicto, but the complaint itself is meant to alleged a... just a fraud 10(b)(5) violation in the context of a market manipulation, and that the plaintiffs were injured by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.095" offset="7958800">What makes it a little bit different is that the complaint alleges that the Plaintiffs, who ended up losing their money, were utilized as an instrumentality of the Defendants' fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.164" offset="8019091">In other words, it was the intent of the Defendants to provide intentionally false information alleged to be inside to the Plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.289" offset="8059633">They initiated the contact, they did it for purposes of having the Plaintiffs trade, driving the price of the stock up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.387" offset="8099966">They never intended the Plaintiffs to benefit from that market manipulation, and in fact, as the Complaint alleges, when the Plaintiffs indicated some desire to sell when the stock got up at its higher levels, they continued the fraud so that they would continue to hold on to their stock by saying, wait, it will go higher, it will go higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.033" offset="8194529">So it is not a situation where the Defendants and the Plaintiffs embarked upon a conspiracy to somehow utilize inside information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.787" offset="8233609">It is solely a situation where the defendants are alleged to have embarked upon scheme to defraud the market and defraud these plaintiffs.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce N. Kuhlik</label>
            <text syncTime="2788.028" offset="11286591">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.049" offset="11302683">I would like to focus on what the Commission believes is the dispositive factor in this litigation, and that is the furtherance of the public interest in deterring violations of the federal securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.888" offset="11362033">We think that there can be no doubt that allowing this lawsuit to go forward in the circumstances as we now believe them to be will further, will best further the deterrence of violations of Section 10 (b) and Rule 10 (b)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.852" offset="11437893">Now, deterrence of wrongdoing is an important component of the in pari delicto defense as it has developed at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.698" offset="11477285">The courts engaged in a flexible balancing of relative fault in order to determine which party was the primary wrongdoer who should be deterred in the first instance, and we think that in the federal regulatory scheme presented in this case where private actions such as those under Rule 10(b), or excuse me, Rule 10(b)(5), makes an important contribution to enforcement of the federal securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.367" offset="11599956">We think that the Court's decision in Perma Life Mufflers which held the defense unavailable in a private action under the antitrust laws because the defense would not further the deterrent purpose of the Sherman and Clayton Act, we think that that case requires that the defense be applied here only if it will further the purposes of the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.145" offset="11707058">Now, I would like to turn first to the deterrence of wrongdoing by brokerage professionals and insiders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.960" offset="11734330">I don't think there can be any doubt that allowing the lawsuit to go forward will deter brokerage sales people such as Mr. Lazzaro here from perpetrating frauds on their clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.549" offset="11784694">That is the whole purpose of the action to be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.201" offset="11803293">And the only question then becomes whether or not there is some other overriding factor on the other side in terms of perhaps encouraging wrongdoing by persons in the position of the Plaintiffs that would, as I say, override this deterrent impact on the brokers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.676" offset="11889184">And we think that that overriding factor on the other side just isn't present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.888" offset="11909978">In the Commission's view, allowing this action to go forward will not unduly encourage illegal tippee trading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.794" offset="11941638">In the first place, allowing the suit to go forward will deter brokers from giving information in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.968" offset="11970268">It will cut that inside information off at the source.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.320" offset="11983747">It won't be there for the tippees to trade on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.162" offset="11995137">In the second place, investors in the position of the Plaintiffs, in the Commission's view, are often unsophisticated, certainly as compared with the brokerage professionals here, it might be believed that they were unsophisticated, unschooled in the law, and we think that for that reason the brokerage professionals are far more likely to respond to the deterrent impact of not allowing the defense here than ordinary investors would be to the deterrent impact on their trading of allowing the defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3217.679" offset="13005135">They are continually in a position to come into inside information, to represent or to misrepresent to their clients, to their friends, to their investors that they have access to this sort of information.</text>

            <text syncTime="3240.192" offset="13095205">If a plaintiff wants to trade, he has to do it through a broker, and it is up to the brokers to be... they are required to be conversant with the law, to be conversant with Commission rules, regulations and the statute, and it is up to them in the first instance to guide the trading of their clients into lawful channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.797" offset="13185589">And that position of trust was abused here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.730" offset="13201367">And if the Commission is to be able to uncover these sorts of frauds perpetrated on investors, the only realistic way for most of these frauds to come to light is through private actions such as these, and I think there can be no doubt that the investors would have little incentive indeed to bring these sorts of actions to light because by doing so, they expose themselves to possible criminal and civil sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.169" offset="13319127">So without the incentive of recovering their investment, it is most, most unlikely that these sorts of frauds would be uncovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.654" offset="13353086">And finally, we would note in regard to the position of the parties here, that in the Commission's view, the in pari delicto defense should be available in those securities actions where the plaintiffs, perhaps the investors, have instigated an illegal scheme, are truly involved in a conspiracy with a broker for their mutual benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.769" offset="13453501">But that is not what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.842" offset="13461860">That is why I would like to turn then to the comparative fault of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.356" offset="13483907">The Petitioner claims that under the common law, a plaintiff who is guilty of fraud is barred from recovering under the in pari delicto doctrine under all circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="3456.793" offset="13961635">So in that respect, even if all of the information is false, it may well be that the investors here have attempted to violate the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3475.556" offset="14036658">Under the common law, it was not enough simply, or it is not enough now, as the common law has developed, that the plaintiff simply has engaged in a fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.591" offset="14072812">A more refined balancing takes place that takes into account the deterrent purposes of the law and the actual degree of wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.308" offset="14115653">And we cite a number of cases in our briefs where, for example, a plaintiff who believed he was defrauding others by engaging in a fixed foot race was allowed to recover, notwithstanding the in pari delicto doctrine, from the parties who had defrauded him, because the race in fact was fixed against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.551" offset="14196632">Finally, I would note that we believe it makes little sense to adopt a rule that would distinguish solely on the basis of whether the investors had noticed that the information they were trading on was inside or indeed was information obtained in breach of an insider's duty because we wouldn't want to allow brokers to escape liability simply by couching their tips in terms of inside information.</text>
