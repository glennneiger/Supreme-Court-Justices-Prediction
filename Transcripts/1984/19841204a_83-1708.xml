            <text syncTime="80.503" offset="454950">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here today, I believe, because the District Court did precisely that which this Court subsequently declared in its decision Southland versus Keating that a federal judge should not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.117" offset="537393">That is, the District Court undermined the expectations of the petitioner who desired arbitration pursuant to a contract related to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.775" offset="588070">This case involves a civil suit filed in the Federal District Court by a customer against the securities broker/dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.191" offset="629761">The complaint asserts four claims under state law, all of which are subject to a valid preexisting agreement to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.030" offset="673125">The customer, in addition to asserting those four state law claims, asserts one claim under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.828" offset="720250">The petitioner sought arbitration of the four state law claims, but the District Court denied that arbitration, because that court in its subjective determination felt that the factual and legal issues involved in all of the claims were intertwined.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.471" offset="806872">The Ninth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.884" offset="816485">In this regard, the Ninth Circuit is joined by two other circuits who have come down in effect in the same way on a similar issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.870" offset="852429">On the other side of the coin, there are three circuits that have come down on the opposite side of this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.213" offset="881791">Thus, there is an even split between six circuits that have considered this issue called intertwining.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.629" offset="911466">The question thus presented today is whether the District Court erred in denying the petitioner's motion for an order compelling arbitration of the respondent's state law claims and staying that arbitration pending judicial resolution of the respondent's claim under the federal securities laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="385.784" offset="1676122">The complaint alleges that the registered representative altered the client information forms in certain ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.646" offset="1703499">It further alleges that after the account was open for a short period, that the registered representative engaged in unauthorized trading for this account, and that the registered representative started dealing in options, and in naked options.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.169" offset="1769641">The complaint further alleges that both the registered representative and the branch office manager in this particular branch assured the plaintiff that the account was okay and that everything was doing well, even though the statements in the confirms might have indicated otherwise to the doctor, and in fact when the account apparently had lost about $100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.722" offset="1859815">Now, out of this common nucleus of fact, the doctor alleges violations of the California state securities laws, alleges common law fraud and deceipt, alleges breach of fiduciary duty on behalf of the broker/dealer firm, and alleges negligence, and with respect to three of those claims he is seeking punitive damages which clearly are not available under a Section 10(b) claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.482" offset="1978934">He lastly alleges also a Section 10(b) claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.736" offset="1999936">Now, the Court, as we have said, indicated that the facts and the legal issues were so intertwined that to separate those issues and to send the four claims to arbitration after first adjudicating the 10(b)(5) claim would be a waste of efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.270" offset="2086036">The problems with that decision and the intertwining theory are both legal and practical.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.636" offset="2115502">First, from a legal standpoint, the Court seems not to be listening to the music of Cone when Cone indicated that the federal court should have a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="562.809" offset="2384250">Now, the decisions of the Ninth, Fifth, and Eleventh Circuits are in contravention of those statements, and they are frustrating the rights of parties who feel that they are entitled to arbitration pursuant to a valid contract to get that arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="793.812" offset="3308253">So, while we would encourage this Court to take a look at whether Wilco does apply in fact to implied rights brought under Section 10(b), we can't stop there We must also look at the intertwining, whether or not that fits with this Court's and Congress's scheme of things that it provided for in arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1177.545" offset="4843104">I sincerely believe, and of course the State of California very frequently and most recently has again embraced arbitration of disputes between customers and their stockbrokers, and it says if there is a valid arbitration agreement, we are going to enforce it, and you must arbitrate those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.111" offset="4953445">So, the plaintiff now, under the approach of the Ninth Circuit, all he has to do is take those same claims across the street to the federal court, add on a claim or an alleged claim under the '34 Act, and say I am home free, I do not have to arbitrate, and that is one of the evils, I believe, of the intertwining approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.407" offset="5050620">This Court further has declared in the Prima Paint case that with regard to an application under Section 3 of the Arbitration Act that the court can consider only two issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="1257.305" offset="5162215">One is the arbitration clause, part of a written contract or a maritime agreement or a written contract affecting and arising out of interstate commerce, and I think it is beyond peradventure now that these margin agreements and agreements with regard to option accounts that contain arbitration clauses in many instances, not uniformly, are certainly contracts arising out of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.743" offset="5271930">The only other limitation that this Court said in the Keating case would affect a party's right to arbitrate are such limitations that are provided by either law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.134" offset="5341520">Well, it escapes me whether it is anything in the intertwining theory that speaks of that being a ground to revoke the arbitration clause itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1317.936" offset="5404736">It is more of a procedural argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.577" offset="5415290">These statements of Congress mandating arbitration and the statements of this Court simply leave no room for denying arbitration on the basis of some subjective and, I submit, debatable theory that the arbitration claims are intertwined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.713" offset="5503793">In your recent Cone decision, this Court recognized that if it is necessary in order to give full force and effect to a valid arbitration clause, that you must divide the dispute and have that dispute resolved in separate forums, that that should be done, and that is precisely what the petitioner is requesting be done here, is that if in fact claims under the '34 Act or 10(b)(5) are not subject to arbitration, then we want the claims divided, and the Court recognized that as a valid principle in the Cone case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.477" offset="5670872">The Ninth Circuit and other circuits have attempted to rationalize their holding using Wilco as a basis for the rationalization, but that rationalization fails for these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.328" offset="5730326">First, as I mentioned earlier, Wilco involved what this Court perceived to be a conflict between two Congressionally mandated statutes and ended up in its analysis saying one prevailed over the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.288" offset="5790095">That is quite a different story that we have here, when we have a clear Congressional mandate favoring arbitration, and for a court to say we have some theory here regarding an implied right of action that will overcome that Congressional mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.061" offset="5873164">It seems that doesn't square with Wilco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.485" offset="5890927">This Court in the Keating case made reference in a footnote to an attempt by the California Supreme Court to analogize Wilco, and this Court stated that Wilco was two federal Congressional statutes, and that it is a far different thing when you are dealing with a state's attempt to legislate a new exception to arbitration, and this Court didn't buy that, and said that the state could not legislate a new method to escape arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1653.224" offset="6745863">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, respondent in this case, Dr. Byrd, sees the issue before the Court as being whether the District Court has discretion to deny arbitration of claims which are otherwise arbitrable when those claims are factually and legally intertwined with a nonarbitrable federal securities claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.806" offset="6828201">This draws into question the scope of the Federal Arbitration Act and its impact on federal protective legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.131" offset="6853487">Dr. Byrd starts from the premise that his claim under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is not arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.337" offset="6882326">He did not seek arbitration of that claim in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.980" offset="6896850">Nevertheless, the issue has been raised by the Securities Industry Association in their amicus brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.093" offset="6921301">In Wilco versus Swan, this Court held that arbitration of claims brought under the Securities Act of 1933 could not be impelled to be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.378" offset="6958499">While the Supreme Court has not held... ruled on whether '34 Act claims can be arbitrated, every Court of Appeal which has addressed the question has found that the logic of Wilco versus Swan is equally applicable to claims brought under the Securities and Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.419" offset="7022656">Recently the Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a rule requiring brokers to disclose that claims brought under the securities statutes are not subject to arbitration, and finding that the failure to disclose that fact is deceptive and fraudulent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.778" offset="7088067">Consequently this case concerns only the arbitrability of the pending claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.434" offset="7110741">The Courts of Appeal which have addressed this issue are evenly split.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.736" offset="7127877">The Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Circuits have held that the District Court has no discretion retain jurisdiction over pending claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.942" offset="7156717">I suppose our judgment, if we were to make it, that Wilco was not applicable to a claim under the '34 Act, ever though that question is not squarely presented, might affect our judgment as to the force of the intertwining argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1776.956" offset="7240831">However, I would contend it is not before the Court, and it is not part of the motion that was made in the District Court, and that in any case if the Court does consider that issue, that it should determine that the '34 Act claims are not subject to arbitration based on the same reasoning as the Court applied in Wilco versus Swan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.905" offset="7312615">The Circuit Courts of Appeal which have held that the District Courts do not have discretion to keep the pendent claims have done so on the basis of finding that the Arbitration Act compelled severance and separate arbitration in all circumstances without regard for the attendant conditions of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.230" offset="7401850">The Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits, however, have held that the District Courts have discretion to retain jurisdiction of the entire case to promote the protective purposes of federal protective legislation where the pending claims are factually and legally intertwined with the federal securities claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3124.920" offset="12632609">It is of interest to me that the attention of the argument focused quickly on punitive damages, which are, of course, not available under the federal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.236" offset="12673882">Doesn't that indicate that the state issues substantially predominate in this case, and if that is the case, shouldn't we look to this Court's reasoning in United Mine Workers versus Gibbs, where this Court, in talking about the entertaining of pendent claims stated that if the state issues substantially predominate, if there would be different levels of proof, likelihood of perhaps confusion of the court or the jury, that the Court should feel free to dismiss those pendent claims rather than retainment.</text>

            <label>Justice Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3230.796" offset="13056106">That's what I thought, yes.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eugene W. Bell</label>
            <text syncTime="3232.088" offset="13061330">And to return to the question asked earlier about arbitration, I believe the rationale of the New York state opinion with regard to an arbitrator's power to award punitive damage would be applied in almost any state that considered it, and that is that punitive damages are not a matter of a plaintiff's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.630" offset="13139489">It is a way that a state has or a judicial system has of enforcing its policies and making sure that people don't have reckless disregard for those policies, and they are assessed against a person for reckless conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.312" offset="13210228">They are not awarded to anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.214" offset="13217856">He just happens to be the incidental beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.297" offset="13230186">So, punitive damages aren't a matter of right, and I can see why the state would say that arbitrators aren't the people we want to feel we have empowered to award punitive damages and enforce this policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.535" offset="13287133">A question that was raised earlier with regard to the grounds of revoking under the Southland-Keating case, the Court recognized that in addition to whether it is a contractor involving maritime or interstate commerce, you could lock legitimately at any grounds that exist in law or in equity to revoke the contract generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.476" offset="13414819">And to say that the intertwining was a ground for revoking it just files in the face of the conduct, because once a court finds intertwining, he doesn't revoke the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.124" offset="13457451">He says it can go forward, but in my discretion I will either let it go forward or I won't let it go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.508" offset="13487022">He doesn't revoke the agreement and say that it is a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.392" offset="13502486">So that argument just doesn't seem to swing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.243" offset="13517951">And lastly, with regard to the rebuttal on the question of freely bargained for contracts and the provisions in the contract, I have examined the record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.350" offset="13558388">There isn't one scintilla of evidence before this Court in the record that any facts were considered at any level by the District Court or beyond or even presented by Dr. Byrd that this contract was not freely negotiated, that he had any doubts about the contract, or that... I am sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.263" offset="13641980">Thank you.</text>
