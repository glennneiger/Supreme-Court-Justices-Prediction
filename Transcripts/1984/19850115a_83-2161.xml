            <text syncTime="16.182" offset="193600">Thank you, Your Honor, and if it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.614" offset="207288">The issue in this case is whether the express tax authorization provision in the 1924 Indian Mineral Leasing Act which would allow Montana to tax the Blackfeet Tribe's mineral royalties has been eradicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.592" offset="263190">The 1924 Indian Mineral Leasing Act allowed the Secretary of the Interior to enter into long-term leases for oil and gas on unallotted lands on treaty reservations with the consent of the affected tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.481" offset="318779">That Act also allowed for the taxation of all minerals, not just oil and gas, produced on these same allotted lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.918" offset="356500">No regulations were ever drafted to implement the taxation provision of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.294" offset="378025">The State of Montana has taxed oil and gas production on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation since 1936 when this Court held in British-American Oil Producing Company that the 1924 Act applied to the Blackfeet oil and gas leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.416" offset="458482">In 1977 the Solicitor held that the 1938 Indian Mineral Leasing Act replaced completely the 1924 Indian Mineral Leasing Act, so that the tax authorization that was specifically included in the '24 Act was limited to pre-1938 Act leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.912" offset="560568">This case was filed by the Blackfeet Tribe shortly afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.997" offset="580839">The Blackfeet Tribe alleged and insisted that some of the state's taxes fell under royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.752" offset="611873">They alleged that the 1938 Act completely replaced the '24 Act, and that that replacement did away with the taxing provisions in the '24 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.747" offset="655863">And they alleged that the language in the 1924 Act which refers to such lands that can be taxed is limited to lands that are leased in fact under the 1924 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.609" offset="719288">In Montana the oil and gas producers file all the tax returns with the state, and they are solely responsible for all tax payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.386" offset="762443">The producers are not parties to this case, and the tribe doesn't challenge the taxes on the producers' share.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.963" offset="796715">The predecessor taxes to the Montana taxes challenged here were challenged in 1935 within months of a written opinion that was issued by the Department of Interior stating that Montana's taxes could not be imposed on the production of oil and gas on the Blackfeet Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.236" offset="885845">The taxes on both the producers' share and the royalty owner's share in that case were specifically challenged in British-North American Oil Producing Company.</text>

Reynolds this Court said that when there's a repealer such as the one in the 1938 Act that repeals acts or parts of acts inconsistent with the Act, that that in itself means that there remains... there remains the specific provisions in previous acts so long as they're not contrary to the later general act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1883.139" offset="7661381">One other point about the wording of this 1938 Act is that Sections 1 and 2 do essentially incorporate and refer to the words of the 1924 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.309" offset="7738077">Congress was obviously looking at that act when it enacted the 1938 Act, and it chose to incorporate the most important provisions of that Act governing leasing, but significantly, it did not carry forward and incorporate the tax provision of the '24 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1934.481" offset="7866808">But our argument does not raise any specific issue of repeal, although we do recognize that the '24 Act may still continue to exist to govern prior leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.510" offset="7926890">The second premise of our argument is that the legislative history and purposes make clear that the '38 Act is a replacement statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.940" offset="7972657">The legislative history is clear that prior laws were considered inadequate; that the '38 Act was proposed as a more satisfactory law for leasing of Indian lands for mining purposes; and it was proposed as an act to regulate mining on Indian land and not to amend prior laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.104" offset="8073280">There were three major purposes of the 1938 Act: to bring uniformity to the area of Indian law or Indian mining; to bring mining leases into harmony with the Indian Reorganization Act; and to ensure that the Indians received the greatest economic return from their land.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="2430.038" offset="9848980">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.055" offset="9893074">The state concedes in this case that there's nothing in the language or the legislative history of the 1938 Act to authorize state taxation of leases issued under the Act, and that, in our view, is a sufficient answer to the state's claim in this case; because it is well established that in the absence of an express authorization, states have no authority to tax on Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.488" offset="9982831">There are a number of reasons why that principle is particularly forceful here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.711" offset="9999759">First of all, in 1937, just a year earlier, the same Congress that passed the 1938 Act revised the special Kwapaw Taxing Act that we discuss at page 19 of our brief in which Congress, in response to this very concern that states might be viewed to have power to tax absent some express authorization in the statute, put in statutory form the rule that it understood to be applied in such cases; and that is that Indian resources are held without being subject to state taxation in the absence of a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.092" offset="10129221">And the Kwapaw tax statute is significant for another reason: because that tax, even though it applied in the special circumstances of Oklahoma that we describe at some length in our brief, induced Congress to authorize taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.692" offset="10179585">Congress nevertheless narrowed that particular tax to limit the type of tax, to limit the amount of the tax, to limit the minerals that it applied to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.509" offset="10218874">And in our view it seems quite unlikely that Congress, having done that for Indians that Congress had believed were appropriately subject to state taxation, would have intended to preserve by mere inference the much broader and open-ended tax authority that had been enacted in 1924.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.878" offset="10284389">And this is especially so since the '24 Act was specifically patterned after the Kwapaw taxing statute in Oklahoma.</text>

            <text syncTime="2555.909" offset="10352516">What I am suggesting is that the... is the tool of construction for construing the 1938 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.783" offset="10376026">I'm not suggesting that the Indian Reorganization Act or this Kwapaw statute of their own force narrowed the prior taxing authority, but for example, when Congress enacted the 1938 Act, it expressly did that to bring the '38 leasing schemes into harmony with the policies of the Indian Reorganization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.015" offset="10448960">It's that fact that makes the Indian Reorganization Act relevant, because Congress decided that the leasing program should be coordinated with the IRA, and for that reason it is appropriate--</text>

            <text syncTime="3079.101" offset="12445238">Your Honor, we would agree with Mr. Kneedler that the 1942 edition of Cohen should be looked at here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.248" offset="12477839">And Mr. Kneedler cites us to Cohen for the proposition that the '38 Act superseded the '24 Act and that that supersession does away with the tax authority.</text>

            <label>Ms. Deirdre Boggs</label>
            <text syncTime="3106.570" offset="12555161">--Of his 1942 edition of "Federal Indian Law"... excuse me... talks about the authority of states to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.846" offset="12600301">This was after 1938 that he put out this edition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.619" offset="12615347">And there in that section he refers to the 1924 Act as the example of states' authority to tax as granted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.990" offset="12668846">It's clear that in the earlier page that Mr. Kneedler refers to that Felix Cohen is referring to the leasing provisions, not the taxation provision, in the 1924 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.327" offset="12722136">The tribe insists that this is a case involving statutory construction, and it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.972" offset="12748781">And the tribe went through the fact that the '38 Act incorporates and carries forward all parts of the '24 Act except the taxation authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.568" offset="12791099">The reason for this is that Congress had very specific defects in mind with the Indian mineral leasing that it set forth to cure; and it has told us what those defects are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.680" offset="12863615">One is that on some reservations no leasing was permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.403" offset="12878452">A major defect is that in many cases where leasing was permitted... for example, in the 1919 Act... the tribe had absolutely nothing to say about whether or not there would be leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.294" offset="12934041">They didn't have a thing to say about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.876" offset="12944385">Another defect was that in many cases there could not be long-term leases, which, of course, prohibited production.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.329" offset="12974165">And, in general, the defects inherent in the 1919 Act for metals where the public land laws applied to minerals... mineral leasing on Indian reservations were seen as things that needed to be cured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.500" offset="13034874">They do not see taxation as a problem that needs to be cured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.252" offset="13053891">The replacement theory I think doesn't work, can't work in this case where you have a repealer that repeals only things inconsistent with the act stated, especially when we have Congress telling us what they're doing with the '38 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.731" offset="13115749">And what they're doing is taking care of specific defects which do not include taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.935" offset="13132572">I'd just like to quickly say one other thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.327" offset="13142185">I wasn't clear on whether Mr. Kneedler indicated whether or not the U.S. knew or didn't know about the taxation in the state of Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.623" offset="13179383">Part of the evidence submitted to the district court by the tribe included sheets where the U.S. Geological Survey specifically credited to the tribal royalty the amount of taxes paid by the producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.354" offset="13246257">There are sheets and sheets of this where the United States has given credit to the producers on the royalty payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.870" offset="13276350">And the other thing that again was in the district court record... it's not part of the printed record here; it's attached to briefs in the district court... is a letter, 1978, from the Geological Survey, again to the producers, indicating that this past policy of crediting to the royalty payments the taxes or some of the taxes that they paid will no longer happen, indicating again that the practice had been to do that pretty consistently.</text>
