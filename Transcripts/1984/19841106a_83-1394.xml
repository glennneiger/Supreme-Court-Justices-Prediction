            <text syncTime="92.676" offset="492276">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in 1976, Congress enacted the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, known as FLPMA.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.067" offset="537834">This was the first statute to give the Bureau of Land Management comprehensive authority to manage the public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.987" offset="565524">In the course of enacting FLPMA, Congress sought to provide a solution for a long standing public land management problem that involved the lack of information about unpatented mining claims that had been located on millions of acres of federal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.349" offset="631039">Since the 1860's and 1870's, when that system of mining claims on federal lands was established, millions of claims had been located on federal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.305" offset="670849">The problem was that no one knew where they were or what their status was.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.193" offset="690389">The general mining laws didn't provide any mechanism for notification to the federal government when a claim was located or when it was abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.631" offset="732080">The only time a claimant had to report to the federal government concerning his claim was if he elected to proceed to patent, that is, to take steps to obtain full ownership of the land on which the claim was located.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.974" offset="789445">Most claimants didn't bother to take that step, so BLM did not have any information on the status of these claims, and that situation made it very difficult for the federal land managers to take actions with respect to federal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.334" offset="850885">Unless BLM did some fairly extensive research at the local county courthouse and then tried to track down all of these potential claimants it identified, it simply couldn't be sure one way or the other about whether the land at issue was encumbered by such claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.712" offset="920475">And that interfered with the ability to go ahead and take action with respect to a piece of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.849" offset="945031">Now, Congress sought to remedy that situation in Section 314 of FLPMA.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.087" offset="969899">Under that section, a claimant must make an initial filing with the Bureau of Land Management within three years of the passage of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.293" offset="1002813">The claimant then must update that information annually by filing a piece of paper prior to December 31st.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.764" offset="1132694">It could be that someone simply was careless in drafting and didn't realize that they had done what they had done.</text>

            <text syncTime="1359.176" offset="5558255">But I don't think the American Mining Congress was necessarily simply thinking about the interests of big groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.449" offset="5591378">Mobil has filed an amicus brief in this case, and it seems to have a similar problem, so I don't think the American Mining Congress was focused solely on the big people on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.888" offset="5633174">The situation of the mining claimant is that they come and they go in a lot of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.392" offset="5659192">Many of them are not in a situation of appellees here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.411" offset="5671209">They don't have a stable producing operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.148" offset="5690226">There are people who come onto the land, who locate their claim, who decide after a year or two that it is really not worth it, they just don't find what they thought they might find, and they move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.853" offset="5728991">In those sorts of circumstances, they are the ones who know whether they want to keep the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.157" offset="5750203">It is reasonable for Congress to have concluded that they could assume the minimal burden of providing a piece of paper each year to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.030" offset="5789700">Now, appellees and amici have suggested alternatively, and the District Court also accepted this argument, that some sort of substantial compliance would be sufficient under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.921" offset="5837243">If you come close enough, then you ought to assure that you are not going to lose your claim, they suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.760" offset="5864619">I would like to suggest briefly why we don't think that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.879" offset="5881129">The face of the statute does not seem to suggest that there is this leeway to sort of deviate from the statute to one extent or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.453" offset="5927418">It doesn't suggest a sliding scale of compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.488" offset="5939538">Remember that this system involves millions of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.042" offset="5957720">I think Congress was aware that if it established this sort of a sliding scale standard, the Secretary could be faced with thousands, tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of factual situations in which people come in and say, well, two weeks late, a month and a half late, that didn't hurt you, that is substantial compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.972" offset="6045491">And at the same time, I think the Secretary is going to be faced with a situation under that sort of standard in which he doesn't have any good way to decide what the cutoff should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.161" offset="6086242">You are going to have people arguing that it is arbitrary and capricious to cut it off at one point or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.417" offset="6111215">You are going to have not only claimants who are disappointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.017" offset="6121664">You are going to have third party people who thought they were going to be able to relocate or to locate claims after someone else's had lapsed under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.040" offset="6157713">We don't think that there is any indication that Congress intended to impose that sort of administratively complex system in the context of a statute that was designed to simplify things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.632" offset="6212152">It is like the argument about abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.917" offset="6225318">There is no indication that Congress was envisioning some massive factfinding process that would require the BLM to take evidence on the intent to abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.875" offset="6265129">In your heart you may want to keep your claim, but I think the point here was, if you don't submit something that is objective evidence that land managers can rely on, Congress made the determination that you would lose your claim in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.152" offset="6334196">If there are no questions at this time, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold A. Swafford</label>
            <text syncTime="1562.526" offset="6371708">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.692" offset="6380381">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as pointed out by the appellants, the Lockes own ten unpatented mining claims near Ely, Nevada, which they have operated for 24 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.641" offset="6468152">On April 4th, 1981, the Bureau of Land Management in Reno issued an opinion stating that the Locke's claims were deemed to be abandoned because they had filed an annual affidavit one day late.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.799" offset="6524786">The Lockes had fully complied with the statute the prior year in regard to their initial filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.988" offset="6557595">Under the Act, they were required to file certificates of location for each of their claims, maps, affidavits, and they did all of that prior to the deadline in October of 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.315" offset="6610885">The court found below that the BLM had then opened a file on the Lockes showing their claims to be active mining claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.103" offset="6649964">Now, the statute at issue herein provides that the failure to file any of the instruments required in the Act shall be deemed conclusively to constitute an abandonment of the claim by the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.180" offset="6702314">The District Court viewed that as an irrebuttable presumption which to us seems pretty obvious on its face, and decided the case in accordance with this Court's decision in Vlandis versus Klein and other irrebuttable presumption cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.706" offset="6772427">The Court found that because that presumption of abandonment wasn't unnecessary or universally true, especially where the Lockes had operated their claims for 24 years, and indicated by filing their documents that they didn't intend to abandon, they should have a hearing or some method by which they should have an opportunity to rebut the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.888" offset="6861138">Now, the appellants attacked the District Court's decision by saying that this doesn't present an irrebuttable presumption at all, and they argue further that the court ought to decide the case in accordance with Texaco versus Short.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.665" offset="6924250">We think this is a pretty novel interpretation, and the Court should look at the statute, look at what it says on its face, and not search for other meanings in other cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2365.881" offset="9585083">Well, your position has already conceded that the earlier filing of an intention to retain a claim is valid, so you do concede that the government can come in and impose some additional conditions on holding an unpatented claim?</text>

          <turn speaker="harold_a_swafford" startTime="2385.260" stopTime="2633.637">
            <label>Mr. Harold A. Swafford</label>
            <text syncTime="2385.260" offset="9662614">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.331" offset="9678915">I think in a certain circumstance, but not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.365" offset="9691035">I don't see how it could be done here under this statute, is why I have problems with it, because it did set up abandonment, I think, as the standard for losing your claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.756" offset="9740668">Now, there are differences in Texaco versus Short with this case, I mean, major differences, in that the treatment... it is the treatment of operating mines that is really different in the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.533" offset="9803780">In the Texaco versus Short context, operating mining claims are protected because the statute is only directed to eliminating claims where work has not been done for more than 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.542" offset="9859787">In this statute, Congress chose to protect operating mines, I think, by requiring that they be abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.148" offset="9894164">Because of that difference, I think the Court should not adopt and force this case into a Texaco versus Short situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.587" offset="9931989">Here, we do have the clear, irrebuttable presumption, and I think the District Court was right, and this Court should affirm that, on deciding this case in accordance with Vlandis versus Klein.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.979" offset="9981517">Now, the Court also found that the Lockes had substantially complied with the statute by doing many things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.536" offset="10023731">Now, the government says you can't substantially comply with the cutoff date, but the Act required numerous things to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.173" offset="10050271">The Act required the Lockes to file in 1979 their certificates of labor... location, the maps and the affidavits of labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.414" offset="10099277">In 1980, the Lockes produced $1 million worth of materials, and they filed their affidavit with the White Pine County, Nevada, Recorder's Office, and they also filed that with the Bureau of Land Management in Reno, although it was one day late.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.376" offset="10167091">The Court looked at all of the acts, the things that the Lockes had done, and stated that they had substantially met all of the requirements of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.100" offset="10214007">The Court relied on Hickel versus Shell Oil Company in that line of cases which dealt with performance of annual assessment work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.456" offset="10251414">In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that if you substantially complied, that is sufficient under the assessment work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.229" offset="10290493">The lower court did not see that any of the purposes of the Act would be defeated by having the Lockes... by ruling in their favor on substantial compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.238" offset="10342529">In other words, they found that the purposes of the Act were to eliminate this long buildup of six million long dormant claims on the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.029" offset="10389759">Those purposes had already been accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.445" offset="10399372">And further, that the Lockes had indeed registered with the BLM, so the BLM knew they were active claims at the very time that they terminated them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.437" offset="10439391">So the purposes of the Act had been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.537" offset="10447751">Now, the appellants have now apparently adopted a substantial compliance standard here by permitting annual affidavits to be filed by January 19th if they are postmarked by December 30th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.548" offset="10507832">A literal reading of the statute would require a December 30th filing, and this seems to be a departure from the Act's strict requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.754" offset="10552658">In view of the nature of the irrebuttable presumption that we think this Court should rule on in accordance with the Vlandis versus Klein line of cases, and in view of the substantial compliance of the Lockes with the terms of the Act, we urge this Court to affirm the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.602" offset="10640012">And if there are no more questions by the Court, that concludes my presentation.</text>
