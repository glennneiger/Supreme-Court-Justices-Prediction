            <text syncTime="113.589" offset="596084">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is the case of Herb's Welding versus Gray.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.660" offset="616355">It is a case involving the coverage under the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act to workmen on fixed platforms in inshore Louisiana waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.933" offset="649478">Our position is that Congress did not provide for the coverage of this particular class of claimant, and that there is no justification for extending coverage to him and those like him.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.639" offset="688244">The facts are stated in the Court of Appeals opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.241" offset="698693">The person was working as a welder on an oil production platform within the three-mile limit offshore Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.977" offset="725651">There was a gas explosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.596" offset="732129">He was injured while he was welding.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.846" offset="741115">From the record, we find that he did nothing on this work... on this platform except to weld, and he welded generally on everything, including gas lines, gradings, railings, and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.487" offset="783643">The record establishes that he was doing some welding on a gas lift line and at one place in the record, and a gas flow line in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.426" offset="819378">That is significant because a lift line has absolutely nothing to do with transportation of the gas; a gas flow line conceivably could.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.716" offset="856577">The question here, Your Honors, is not situs.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.020" offset="873818">In other words, in a Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act case, the Court has considered both situs and status.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.006" offset="897746">We concede that if this person is found to be a maritime worker, that the platform itself is a place where this particular type of work is performed, and therefore situs would exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.314" offset="946960">The question in the case is status.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.231" offset="954588">In saying that, I have to start off by saying that there is really nothing maritime in the traditional sense about this type of platform.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.520" offset="987816">I would like first to get into the concepts and the differences between the opponents and the applicants with respect to the details in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.876" offset="1021253">I suggest to the Court that the case here, the decision in this case is controlled by the Court's previous decision in Rodrigue versus Aetna Casualty and Surety Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.000" offset="1065661">The opponents take the position that Rodrigue was a jurisdictional case.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.802" offset="1080916">I suggest that it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.820" offset="1088962">I suggest that at that particular point makes no difference, because in Rodrigue this Court clearly decided that platform oilfield labor was no different from labor in the oilfields on land or anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.997" offset="1145700">In other words, the type of work that this guy was doing at the time he was hurt is no different from oilfield labor anywhere else, either offshore on the Outer Continental Shelf, on the platforms inshore, or in Wyoming.</text>

            <text syncTime="584.982" offset="2481602">Now, of course, there is no question that the Rodrigue case involved a platform three miles out, so this guy with respect to his claim under some compensation Act would have been covered under the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers Act because of OCSLA.</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.479" offset="9411574">But I don't think the '84 amendments really tell you much one way or the other about the case we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.919" offset="9445429">Now this court has recognized that Congress in 1972 clearly intended to end this anomaly of walking in and out of coverage with respect to longshoremen and ship repair types, the people who are the more familiar sort of employees covered by the Act, but there were always other employees covered by the Act, including people like, of course, the construction worker in Perini, including people like Mr. Gray, who by necessity is on water part of the time as a regular part of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.306" offset="9578967">It is of necessity in the offshore oil industry because these structures are out in the middle of the ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.294" offset="9598924">They are surrounded by water on four sides, and it is inevitable that in the course of performing duties, people are going to be going on and off the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.816" offset="9636959">We don't think there is a reason to think that Congress meant to eliminate the anomaly of walking in and out of coverage with respect to these more familiar longshoremen and ship repair people, but to leave the same sort of anomaly, the walking in and out of coverage, with respect to these other employees who have been found by the courts to be covered during part of their activity, while they were on actual navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.115" offset="9734134">I think that is precisely the sort of thing Congress was trying to get away from in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.669" offset="9752420">Now, offshore oil workers like Mr. Gray are inherently amphibious, as I have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.871" offset="9773213">They are a far cry from the truck driver who comes from an inland point, who drops off his cargo in the terminal, and who goes back to the inland point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.477" offset="9807591">Congress wanted to exclude those sorts of people when it used the status requirement, the maritime employment requirement... here we've got someone who is in a much different situation, who works constantly on or directly adjoining water virtually the whole time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.038" offset="9881883">And I think it may be worth noting in response to Justice Powell's question about the Lousiana compensation statute, at the time Congress was considering this problem, it noted that the state compensation benefits were quite low, and I would point out that Lousiana in fact was the lowest of the examples that Congress set out in its report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.352" offset="9963071">So if you're concerned about that sort of discrepancy, so was Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.506" offset="9987731">By way of perspective, I think it is useful to take a minute to look at the pre-1972 situation of offshore oil workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.112" offset="10022108">Substantial categories of these workers were covered, as Justice O'Connor's questions have suggested, and I think it is worth noting that the suggestion in some of the briefs in this case, the amicus briefs, that somehow by finding coverage for Mr. Gray, the Court would be bringing a whole new industry within the Longshoremen's Act, is not so at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.441" offset="10111447">It is really inaccurate to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.810" offset="10120955">Obviously, most directly, Congress had provided under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for coverage, so if you had an oilfield that spanned both sides of the three-mile line, the employer knew that he would be subject at least outside that three-mile boundary to the longshoremen's regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.070" offset="10185948">But you also had people who were inside the three-mile boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.438" offset="10199427">You had the people on these movable rigs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.724" offset="10212593">And some of these movable rigs, while they qualify as vessels, look very much like fixed rigs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.394" offset="10239238">There are these jack up rigs that have legs that extend and retract, and they can sit right down on the seabed floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.066" offset="10269958">Those people, if they did not qualify as the longshoremen's scheme, and you would also have situations like that of Mr. Gray in which you had someone who was traveling between fixed platforms, and who would be covered if his injury was on actual navigable waters during that sort of travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.032" offset="10365880">And they would continue to be covered under the Perini haven't mentioned are those like that of Mr. Gray, who was injured while he was working on a fixed platform inside the three-mile limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.192" offset="10430454">He would be sort of an odd man out before 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.012" offset="10445710">it probably wouldn't have been on actual navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.582" offset="10480087">But his situation in which he was having to go back and forth on actual navigable waters and on the fixed platforms, and depending on the circumstances, possibly to a movable rig, and certainly to the Outer Continental Shelf, certainly suggests that Congress would have wanted to solve his situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.448" offset="10567545">Mr. Shelton of the Drilling Contractors Association testified before Congress when it was considering these amendments, and he said the same thing that Mr. Brown has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.237" offset="10610699">This is an area in which people are subject to job by job assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.057" offset="10629925">You have workers going out to different structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.743" offset="10640688">The employers are confused because there is the series of compensation systems, and whether an employee is covered under one as opposed to the other may depend on what kind of structure he is on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.884" offset="10689275">Extending coverage to a situation like this is clearly consistent with the sort of rationalization that Congress was attempting to achieve in 1972.</text>

            <text syncTime="2682.096" offset="10870043">I think as a matter of common sense you would find this sort of employee to be maritime in the sense that these employees are always on the water or right next to the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.721" offset="10908600">Indeed, the whole industry has an intimate connection with the ocean, with the water, with the vessels that are used in a variety of operations.</text>

            <label>Mr. T. Gerald Henderson</label>
            <text syncTime="2968.882" offset="12017236">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Robert Gray was injured, as has been noted, on a fixed gas and oil production platform located in the Bay Marshan Field, which is divided by the three-mile line separating Louisiana territorial waters from the OCS waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.761" offset="12092782">Gray estimated that approximately 25 percent of his work in the year preceding the accident had been conducted on the OCS, and a review of the map which was entered into evidence before the administrative proceeding indicated that the platform field is an interrelated field with gas operations covering waters that otherwise are not distinguished at all except for the line that runs through that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.328" offset="12194973">In that regard, I think some of the figures that were given by Mr. Brown this morning, the number of workers, 20,000 workers, 60,000 nationwide, I would imagine that those aren't workers that are strictly in state waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.588" offset="12260071">Those are workers who work offshore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.290" offset="12266862">And I would imagine that the overwhelming number of them are already covered under the Longshoremen's Act pursuant to the OCSLA provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.979" offset="12301658">The workers also, like Gray, are moving in and out of coverage in these waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.550" offset="12327884">Gray could be on the OCS as easily as he could be in state territorial waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.203" offset="12354529">It has also been noted that Gray would have been covered had he been on the OCS through the Extension Act, that he would have been covered on transit through the oilfields, and that had he had work on a movable rig, he would have been covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.831" offset="12420985">But because of the combination of the injury in territorial waters and the fixed platform situs, the issue becomes a question about whether Gray is entitled to longshoremen's benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.889" offset="12469259">In looking at status, it is necessary to examine the nature and purpose of Gray's activities, whether those activities have a significant connection to maritime navigation or commerce, and whether the purpose of the activities was to facilitate maritime commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.065" offset="12533938">In Caputo, the Court noted that with respect to landward extension the language of the '72 amendments is broad, and suggests that the Court should take an expansive view of the extended coverage, as well as the focus on maritime connected nature and purpose of the job rather than the location also serves this particular purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.979" offset="12617635">Focusing on Gray's work, the map introduced in evidence during the administrative proceedings depicts the number of platforms existing in both state and OCS waters, and Gray was responsible for welding maintenance work on all these platforms, and was required daily to travel among them in the performance of his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.059" offset="12697987">On some days, he would have to travel to perhaps two or three or four platforms, and on other days he would have work duties on, for example, like the E structure of the platform where he was hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.652" offset="12752322">He was on that for approximately three or four days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.187" offset="12762458">But in any event, he would have to be transported back to the M structure, the Mike structure, where he was housed daily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.627" offset="12804253">In addition to the regular and recurring travel by boat, Gray was required to board the structures, load and unload his equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.648" offset="12836332">His work records document repair work that he did on swing ropes, which is the method by which one gets from a crew boat onto the structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.938" offset="12877501">He did repair work on boat bumpers, life raft launches, cranes, and decking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.627" offset="12904250">But primarily he was responsible for maintaining and repairing and installing oil and gas lines connecting the Bay Marshan Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.550" offset="12939881">As noted by the court below, the maintenance of these lines is vital to the drilling and removal of gas and oil, and offshore oil and gas activity should be construed as maritime commerce because of its primary relationship with the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.642" offset="13004247">It takes place on structures located in the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.427" offset="13015427">It involves transportation across water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.713" offset="13024518">And it of course poses hazards which are complicated by the maritime location.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.117" offset="13046147">Certainly Gray meets this test because his work activity is involved in each one of those requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.187" offset="13078435">The test as formulated by the Fifth Circuit for land-based workers, drawing on the earlier Second Circuit case, is whether the work bore a realistically significant relationship to traditional maritime activity involving navigation and commerce on navigable waters.</text>

            <text syncTime="3581.029" offset="14465850">I think that takes this case out of the coverage under the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.499" offset="14487689">Justice White, you asked the question of whether there was any change in maritime employment in the 1972 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.384" offset="14507228">The forthright answer is, no, sir, there was not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3614.733" offset="14600642">Well, he was an odd man out before 1972, and if Congress wanted to take him out of the category of being an odd man out, Congress had the opportunity in 1972, and they had the opportunity again in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.992" offset="14653723">That doesn't really apply to this case, but there is no action by Congress in either case to take him out, and under those circumstances the failure to pass, whether it was conscious or just a refusal or somebody didn't get around to it, the failure to pass the Tower case is, I believe, significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.936" offset="14717462">If there is a problem with respect to this worker's coverage, Congress should correct it, I suggest, and Congress has that power, as this Court noted in Victory Carriers versus Law under Articles I and III of the Constitution to do so.</text>
