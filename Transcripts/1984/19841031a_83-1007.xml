            <text syncTime="85.337" offset="468144">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is about one small restriction on the power of the IRS to investigate people, the John Doe summons rules of Section 7609(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="102.199" offset="535644">The power is enormous.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.983" offset="542749">And what Section 7609(f) says is that before the IRS can bring all of that power to bear on people whose identity it doesn't even know yet, first it has to show a court of law that it has a reasonable basis for wanting to investigate these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.479" offset="620699">The question is: Do those John Doe summons rules apply when the person who can provide the IRS with the identities it seeks is also a taxpayer who is under audit.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="138.139" stopTime="157.218">
            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="138.139" offset="679422">Mr. Savage, does 7609(f), the John Doe summons procedure, apply only to summons to the people who are third party record keepers, as defined in 7609(a)?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_d_savage" startTime="157.218" stopTime="514.151">
            <label>Mr. Michael D. Savage</label>
            <text syncTime="157.218" offset="755700">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.218" offset="759670">In fact, Section 7609(a) does not apply when Section 7609(f) applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.324" offset="792167">Section 7609(f) deals with summonses which are seeking identities or information about unknown taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.930" offset="830514">Section 7609(a) applies when the IRS has the identities and is seeking information about those people from designated record keepers.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.256" offset="883804">Now, whether Section 7609(f) applies in this case depends on how you read that statute, how you read Section 7609(f), and at first glance the statute does seem ambiguous... but only at first glance.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.533" offset="949006">The problem is that Congress used the word 7609(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="215.657" offset="989443">It said that a summons is a John Doe summons if it fails to identify the person with respect to whose tax liability the summons was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.398" offset="1040434">I don't think there would be any doubt, though... I don't think the government would contend that Congress didn't expect 7609(f) to be used to obtain identities of more than one person.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.860" offset="1118279">One of the examples Congress uses in the legislative history, one of the examples it uses of how the summons was to be applied was in the case of a corporation in which the IRS was trying to get the names of the shareholders of a corporation who had been advised that a corporate reorganization was a tax-free transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.808" offset="1206051">Now, the government takes the position that as long as the summons identifies one person with respect to whose tax liability it was issued, it's not a John Doe summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.651" offset="1261430">But that can't be a correct interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.187" offset="1275536">Suppose, in the example of the corporation that had advised taxpayers that the reorganization was tax-free, suppose that the IRS served a summons which said,</text>
            <text syncTime="299.078" offset="1323184">"Furnish us with the letter that you gave to John Smith advising him the transaction was tax-free, and also furnish us with the names and addressed and Social Security numbers of all the other shareholders in the corporation who received the letter. "</text>
            <text syncTime="317.189" offset="1395595">I don't think the government would contend that that summons was not a John Doe summons simply because it identified one of the shareholders, John Smith, who the IRS said was under audit.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.282" offset="1455990">So the real problem with the statute is that the word "person" is used in the singular.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.084" offset="1471141">If the statute said that a John Doe summons was a summons that did not identify a person or persons with respect to whose tax liability it was issued, then interpreting the statute in this case would be much easier.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.129" offset="1543344">But that is clearly what the statute means.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.016" offset="1558913">Otherwise, the IRS could get around the John Doe summons rules simply by identifying one of Tiffany's customers who was under investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.241" offset="1603843">The statute itself confirms that the word "person", the term "person" must be read as "person" or "persons".</text>
            <text syncTime="379.613" offset="1645326">The statute says that it applies to any summons described in subsection (c) of Section 7609.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.070" offset="1687122">One of the summonses described in subsection (c) of Section 7609 is a summons served under Section 7602.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.812" offset="1738113">One of the summonses... the summons served under Section 7602 is your standard, run-of-the mill summons, served on a taxpayer who's under audit, and who is obviously identified in the summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.870" offset="1790358">The summons served on Tiffany Fine Arts was a Section 7602 summons, and it seems to me that Section 7609(f) says quite clearly that it applies to that kind of a summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.279" offset="1843961">So the language and the meaning of the statute is not so ambiguous after all.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.818" offset="1878129">Now, the Service contends that Section 7609(f) shouldn't be used to... shouldn't be read to interfere with its ability to audit companies such as Tiffany, who are taxpayers, but who also have information on other taxpayers, which is concededly of interest to the Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.882" offset="1958377">I'm not so sure that Section 7609(f) can be read in any other way when a purpose of the summons is to identify those other taxpayers, particularly if you read "person" to mean "person" or "persons", which you must.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.026" offset="2034968">But when the Service argues that Section 7609(f) shouldn't be read to interfere with its audit functions, it's really arguing, in effect, that it should be permitted to determine all by itself when Section 7609(f) applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.305" offset="2100065">And this case shows exactly how that can happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.274" offset="2115948">Tiffany tried to show in this case that the whole thrust of the summons served on it, the whole purpose of the investigation was to audit its customers; that this was the kind of a summons which Congress intended to be covered by Section 7609(f).</text>

            <text syncTime="1204.374" offset="4944278">Now, the rule, the interpretation of Section 7605(f) that we are urging on the Court, we are not suggesting that the Court should rule that the IRS must comply with the John Doe summons procedures whenever it seeks identities of customers of a record keeper who is under audit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.622" offset="5029332">The rule we are urging is that when the overt acts of the agent and the published institutional posture of the Internal Revenue Service demonstrate that a purpose of the summons is to investigate the customers, then the John Doe procedures must be complied with before the summons can be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.785" offset="5113969">The interpretation essentially is the rule set down in the Thompson case in the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.141" offset="5147406">And it's a good rule for a number of reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1260.445" offset="5168617">It asks, was this summons issued with respect to the tax liability of someone who is not identified in the summons?</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.949" offset="5198606">And if the answer to that question is yes, then the John Doe rule applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.602" offset="5217205">Second, it gives vitality to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.454" offset="5228594">It recognizes that the Service does have the power to sidestep the John Doe summons rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="1930.075" offset="7847109">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, our starting point in this case is to point out that this is not a third party summons in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.167" offset="7911474">It is what is known in tax practice as a taxpayer summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.636" offset="7929342">It was a summons issued to Tiffany and its subsidiaries, and it names Tiffany and its subsidiaries as the taxpayer whose liability is under examination in this summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.296" offset="7983990">A major focus of the proceedings below was to determine whether this was a summons legitimately issued for that purpose, and whether the records and information requested were properly producible for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.591" offset="8057238">That phase of the case was litigated under the standards first articulated in United States v. Powell and reiterated many times by this Court, and was quite properly, that part of the case, litigated the same way it would have been litigated prior to 1976 when all of Section 7609 first came into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.824" offset="8166116">And there were affidavits submitted by the agent on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.478" offset="8196731">The criteria of the Powell case are very succinctly stated in that case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.850" offset="8230273">They are something less than probable cause, the Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.904" offset="8246469">All the Commissioner must show is that the investigation is conducted pursuant to a legitimate purpose; that the inquiry may be relevant... he doesn't have to show that it is relevant, it may be relevant to that purpose... and that the information sought is not already within the Commissioner's possession; that the administrative steps required by the Code have been followed, and that it has not been issue for an improper purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.972" offset="8354720">And the examples given were to harass the taxpayer or put pressure on him to settle a collateral dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.793" offset="8381992">And the combination of the agent's affidavits and the legal argument by the United States attorney showed that the agent felt that he had to be able to trace transactions from source documents to books of account, and he would need knowledge of the names of the licensees or the customers for this purpose, and also--</text>

            <text syncTime="2091.126" offset="8491288">So the names, the bare names, as opposed to the transactions or licenses or agreements would be relevant?</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.684" offset="8537577">And also to reconcile reported income with deposits and receivables and to verify that the transactions reported by the Petitioners actually were the transactions that occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.843" offset="8594211">And this was soundly based on based on principles that this Court established in Holland v. the United States back in 348 U.S., one of the leading tax cases, the net worth tax case in which the court pointed out that certainly Congress never intended in the provision there at issue, which was one that limited the government's authority to deviate from the taxpayer's method of accounting, certainly the government... Congress never intended to make that provision a set of blinders which prevents the government from looking beyond the self-serving declarations in a taxpayer's books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.087" offset="8755125">To protect the revenue from those who do not render true accounts, the government must be free to use all legal evidence available to it in determining whether the story told by the taxpayer's books accurately reflects his financial history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.632" offset="8825342">And, in light of those legitimate purposes, showing of why these names be relevant to the audit of Tiffany and its subsidiaries, the courts enforced the summons, applying the Powell standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.908" offset="8894410">The District Court, upheld by the Court of Appeals, under concurrent factual findings, ruled that this would have been an enforceable summons prior to 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.735" offset="8945819">And the legal question before this Court is whether anything in the Tax Reform Act of 1976, which added Section 7609, should change that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.745" offset="9005796">And we think the answer to that question emerges with the greatest clarity if we look at Section 7609 as a whole, as a package, because it was treated by Congress as a package and discussed in the committee reports as a package.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.056" offset="9083014">Before turning specifically to 7609(f), the first provisions in 7609 dealt with notice and rights to intervene for certain identified persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.184" offset="9147589">And there are two aspects of Section 7609 that make it highly implausible that Congress would have wanted or would have intended that statute to change the result that you would have reached under the Powell standards prior to its enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.081" offset="9227105">One is that the very title of Section 7609, which says</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.287" offset="9263990">"Special Procedure for Third Party Summonses. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.039" offset="9283007">that is part of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.757" offset="9289904">As I pointed out at the outset, we are not dealing here with a third party summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.495" offset="9308816">There is no reason to think that special procedures that Congress adopted for third party summonses should change the result that would have been reached with respect to a taxpayer's summons.</text>

            <text syncTime="2510.717" offset="10169708">I must confess I've been a little troubled by the affidavit that both briefs quote, in which the agent says one purpose of the audit was to check out Tiffany.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.591" offset="10209205">It seems to me it's almost the equivalent of saying that the investigation has at least two purposes, one of which was to investigate Tiffany, and the other of which was to investigate the tax liability of certain unidentified persons.</text>

            <text syncTime="2560.216" offset="10367716">The whole case is being litigated on a premise that somehow Congress implied by enacting this provision that there's something improper about the Service's using information that legitimately comes into its possession with respect to one taxpayer, if it shows something about another taxpayer; there's something improper about using it for purposes of pursuing or initiating an investigation about that other taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.571" offset="10497074">The whole Code is built on the contrary premise; that it's up to the Service to pursue whatever information comes into its possession that shows that the tax laws are not being complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.713" offset="10553708">I mean there is even a provision in the Code, Section 7623, which authorizes regulations which have been adopted that provide for rewards for information that comes to the Service showing that somebody has committed tax fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.992" offset="10622776">I think it's a mistake to interpret the statute as if somehow the Service has its hands in the cookie jar if it's legitimately pursuing an audit and discovers that someone else also may not have paid the taxes that they were supposed to pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="2647.357" offset="10716294">Well... but I'm not sure that's a complete answer, because Congress has said that when you're going after identified taxpayers, you want to follow a little different procedure, maybe not--</text>

          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="2656.296" stopTime="3106.989">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="2656.296" offset="10752029">--Yes, they said... but all of that was said in the context of a third party summons and against legislative history saying that this third party record keeper, who isn't himself under investigation, won't have the incentive to make the claims against enforceability of the summons that are available under the law, and therefore, there should be a safeguard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.245" offset="10843771">And the package of safeguards that they enacted was 7609.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.213" offset="10863729">First, a provision, when you identify the person really under investigation, the person or persons, you're supposed to notify them in certain circumstances and give them a chance to intervene and raise not some additional defense, but just the defenses that the summoned person could have raised if he had an interest in raising them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.444" offset="10944604">And then in 7609(f), they said and if there's nobody that you can identify, that you can bring into court, then we'll substitute an ex parte hearing before the judge, and you have to be able to show that the criterion of (f) have been met in order to issue the summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.290" offset="11024016">This is not even in the enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.090" offset="11031226">This is just issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.242" offset="11035824">All other summonses can be issued administratively, and the question is what are the standards in the enforcement proceedings with respect to the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.765" offset="11069887">Now, both aspects of 7609 were responsive to decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.486" offset="11100816">The provisions in parts A and B were responsive to this Court's decision in Donaldson v. the United States, in which it held that a taxpayer under audit, under investigation, had no standing to intervene in, no right to intervene in a summons enforcement proceeding against his former employer, where the Service was seeking information about him from the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.290" offset="11227980">Congress did not overrule Donaldson in that factual context at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.646" offset="11265388">Congress was not concerned with the Service's uncontested access to employer records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.685" offset="11301541">It was bank records and records in which there might be claims of privilege of similar sorts that Congress was concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.226" offset="11339784">It was only the American Bankers Association that testified in favor of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.861" offset="11362250">And so Congress limited the record keepers, the category of record keepers, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, to whom these provisions apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.586" offset="11409166">It defined the third party record keepers here as... various categories of banks, consumer reporting agencies, persons extending credit through credit cards, brokers under the Securities Exchange Act, attorneys, accountants, and then later added barter exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.934" offset="11494534">And it's only if the third party summons is issued to one of these kinds of record keepers that the notice provision goes out and that there's a right to intervene in the enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.444" offset="11552630">And both the House and Senate committee reports made it clear, very explicitly, that the standards to be applied, the defenses to be raised were not to be expanded at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.954" offset="11622638">They said that the taxpayer is allowed to intervene to assert the defenses which are available under present law, but would have standing to raise issues which could be asserted by the third party record keeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.915" offset="11682511">And it specified: such as asserting that the summons is ambiguous, vague, or other deficient in describing the material requested; or that the material requested was not relevant to a lawful investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.390" offset="11732353">In other words, the committee intends that the noticee will be allowed to stand in the shoes of the third party record keeper and assert certain defenses to enforcement which witnesses are traditionally allowed to claim, but which may not be available to intervenors under many court decisions on ground of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.935" offset="11806540">At the same time, it should be made clear that the purpose of this procedure is to facilitate the opportunity of the noticee to raise defenses which are already available under the law, and that these provisions are not intended to expand the substantive rights of these parties, the noticee or the third party witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.365" offset="11888251">And they even add that the noticee will not be permitted to assert defenses that affect only the interests of the third party record keeper, such as improper service on the third party record keeper, or undue burdensomeness in complying with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.608" offset="11953244">So Congress informed itself, very carefully, of the standards this Court had developed in Powell and its progeny, and merely wanted to allow identified taxpayers to raise the same defenses in certain circumstances where they would be precluded by the rule of Donaldson from doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.021" offset="12030880">Now, the fact that this was to apply only to third party summonses is made further clear by a provision we quote on page 20 of our brief, just above the middle of the page, subpart (4) of it, which says that this whole provision, the notice and the intervention provisions, shall not apply to any summons served on the person with respect to whose liability the summons is issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.361" offset="12176225">So it isn't only the title that says that these provisions have been put in solely for third party summonses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.883" offset="12206318">There is an explicit exception with respect to that aspect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.871" offset="12226276">The significant thing here is that Section 7609(f), then, the John Doe provision, uses the same language reaffirming that it refers only to the third party summons situation, and that is the introductory language of 7609(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.236" offset="12327736">And if it's read in conjunction with the heading and with the language used in that exceptions provision in (a), it means the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.342" offset="12360232">I turn now to the bottom of 3A of our briefs Appendix, but it's also in some other materials, the introductory part of 7609(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.320" offset="12432121">"Any summons described in subsection (c) which does not identify the person with respect to whose liability the summons is issued. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.242" offset="12471827">That doesn't mean persons that the Service might also have an interest in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.181" offset="12499517">It means whether the summons identifies the taxpayer whose liability is at issue and is being used to justify the request for the materials in the summons.</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3106.989" offset="12554792">--May I interrupt you again, Mr. Wallace, with... supposing one paragraph of the subpoena plainly did not relate to Tiffany's liability, but somehow said also the name of the customer who bought a million dollar island in Jamaica or something, if you had some descriptor plainly seeking that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.300" offset="12619993">Would you agree that if there was a severable part, that should be treated as a separate subpoena for which 79... the separate procedure would apply?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="3132.306" stopTime="3392.426">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="3132.306" offset="12656042">It may be that there would be a part of it that could not prevail under a 7602 proceeding on as meeting the Powell criteria with respect to our audit of Tiffany, and if so, we would have to follow the 7609(f) procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.285" offset="12732007">Now, in interrelating these two different parts of 7609, it's significant in corroborating that this is the right reading of the statute to think as a practical matter that if we had, in fact, known of the names of some of these licensees and requested not their names, but requested all records of transactions with licensee A and licensee B, those persons would not have had a right under 7609(a) to notice, nor would they have a right under 7609(b) to intervene, because this is not a third party summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.188" offset="12951540">And indeed there is also the other problem that Tiffany is not a record keeper within the meaning of 7609(a) and (b) either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.127" offset="12991350">But the more significant point for our purposes is that this is not a third party summons, so those persons would be in no different position than manufacturer M who might be a supplier to Tiffany, and if we ask, as you often would in a summons, for all records of transactions with this particular supplier, that the supplier doesn't have any right to interfere with our securing those records from the taxpayer who is under audit, even though it's quite true that those records might tell us something about possible tax liabilities of that supplier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.585" offset="13137218">It's quite common in conducting these audits for the Internal Revenue agent to verify the information received from one taxpayer against another taxpayer's files and to pull those files.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.345" offset="13200225">It's part of what he needs to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.547" offset="13209002">If a taxpayer has reported a sales transaction in which a portion of the sales price is attributed to goodwill and another portion to other assets, he wants to see if the other party to the transaction has reported it the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.223" offset="13271696">It may be that that will ultimately lead to his asking his supervisor to authorize an audit of the second person because he, as he conducts his investigation, discovers that the second person may be the one who has not reported his income properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.852" offset="13342227">But that's what the job of the Service is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.837" offset="13354139">And there has never been any impediment to the use of other taxpayer files in conducting audits that are already underway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.432" offset="13420594">Only last term, this Court in the Arthur Young case pointed out that to a large degree, the effectiveness of our self-reporting system of taxation depends on confidence of taxpayers that the Service can pursue persons who might not be paying their fair share of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.618" offset="13545251">And there has never been a holding by this Court or any provision of the tax laws which tells the Service that it has to turn a blind eye on information that has properly come into its possession, through legitimate investigation, that may show that some other taxpayer should also be investigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.583" offset="13633127">And there is no reason to read the provisions at issue in this case differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.137" offset="13655383">They are entirely consistent with that principle.</text>
