            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="140257">We'll hear arguments first this morning in 83-1132, Park 'N Fly, Incorporated, against Dollar Park and Fly.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.356" offset="177664">Mr. Popkin, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan E. Popkin</label>
            <text syncTime="13.158" offset="192815">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.443" offset="205981">This case is a case of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.978" offset="220087">The statutes involved are Sections 1064, 1065, and 1115(b) of Title 15 of the United States Code, the so-called incontestability provisions of the Lanham Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.785" offset="275362">The sole question before this honorable Court is whether this statute, whose constitutionality is unchallenged and the literal meaning of which has been conceded and which is clear, should be interpreted in a way other than as Congress uttered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.180" offset="348923">The factual background of this case is that Park 'N Fly, the Petitioner, was organized in 1967 and started its operations in St. Louis, Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.969" offset="392077">The business of Park 'N Fly was the so-called offsite airport parking, and that business consists, if Your Honor please, of the acquisition of and building of a parking facility in areas proximate to airports.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.997" offset="456234">At those locations, customers or patrons come to park their cars, and then there is a shuttle or bus service that Park 'N Fly provides, or that such offsite airport parking facilities provide, that moves the customer from that offsite facility to the airport, takes him right from his automobile to the gate area or to the area where his baggage will be off-loaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.629" offset="558739">And then upon his return from his trip, buses are circulated at three to five minutes and those buses pick the patrons up, again very close to where they disembark, return them to the parking lot and return them right to their vehicles, from whence they then depart.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.026" offset="632299">Park 'N Fly, as I say, started in 1967 in St. Louis, and they have expanded now so that they are in Cleveland, Boston, New Orleans, Houston, Montreal, Memphis, San Francisco and Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.934" offset="687993">Their operation has truly become national in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.986" offset="704188">The history of the trademark that Park 'N Fly obtained was that in 1969 Park'N Fly, shortly after it opened its second facility in Cleveland, decided to apply for registration under the Lanham Act, and they filed for registration originally in August of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.482" offset="786108">Initially the registration that they sought for their mark, Park 'N Fly, was denied by the examiner at the Patent and Trademark Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.088" offset="820590">It was denied because he found that the mark was merely descriptive of the service that Park 'N Fly was rendering.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.242" offset="849220">Park 'N Fly applied for re-examination of that mark, applied to that examiner within six months, as it had a right to do, and supplemented its presentation with a brief setting forth in detail why it felt that indeed this was not a merely descriptive mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.786" offset="923304">Upon reexamination, the patent examiner, trademark examiner, found that the mark was not merely descriptive and so it was admitted to registration in August, August 31st of 1971, approximately two years after the date on which Park 'N Fly had initially sought registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.069" offset="1012433">In May of 1977, Park 'N Fly filed an affidavit pursuant to the provisions of Section 1065, an affidavit of incontestability, setting forth therein the statutory requirements, namely, that the mark Park 'N Fly as registered had been in constant use for five years, at least five years, and that there was no successful challenge against its validity at that point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.921" offset="1135940">Well, at that moment in May of '77 the certificate, if you will, of incontestability was issued and the mark became incontestable within the meaning of Sections 1065 and 1115(b) of Title 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.450" offset="1206053">During the year 1977, Defendant Dollar Park and Fly was engaged in the identical business in the Portland, Oregon area.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.840" offset="1247535">In early 1977, the Plaintiff, the Petitioner here, Park 'N Fly, became aware of the existence of Dollar Park and Fly in Portland, Oregon, and attempted, unsuccessfully, to extrajudicially discourage them from their continued use of the name Park 'N Fly.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.736" offset="1323186">When those efforts, which were mainly letters, proved unsuccessful, suit was filed in the District Court for Oregon in June of 1978, and the trial judge, Judge Frye, found for the Petitioner and issued an injunction restraining and enjoining the Respondent from using the name Park and Fly because Park and Fly was confusingly similar with Park 'N Fly.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.119" offset="1428721">The Petitioner spelled its name with an apostrophe N, instead of spelling out "and", and the Respondent spelled out "and".</text>
            <text syncTime="332.094" offset="1468531">On appeal, this case went to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and that court, speaking through Judge Kennedy, reversed on October 13th, 1983, and in reversing held that incontestability was not available in a proceeding for injunction or for enforcement of a trademark, but that incontestability applied only in a defensive posture, that is, when somebody was attempting to cancel a mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.565" offset="1598517">And so the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held, the gist of their holding was, that the mark Park 'N Fly cannot be cancelled because of the incontestability provision, but cannot be enforced, because the Ninth Circuit found on its own, without the benefit of holdings from the court below, that the mark was merely descriptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.162" offset="1684825">And so that--</text>

            <text syncTime="393.751" offset="1715232">Exactly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.317" offset="1717426">They cannot have their mark cancelled, but on the other hand they are not entitled to stop anybody from using it.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.005" offset="1744175">So that the gist of the holding was: You are free, Park 'N Fly, Petitioner, to use that mark, but so is the rest of the world because you cannot stop them from using it.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.861" offset="1783673">The sole question, as I indicated earlier, involves the interpretation of the incontestability provision of the Lanham Act, specifically of 1115(b) of Title 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.752" offset="1831215">Yes, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.450" offset="1925988">There's only been one judicial holding or one holding as to whether or not this mark is descriptive, other than what the Ninth Circuit did, and that was what the patent examiner did, the patent and trademark examiner.</text>

            <text syncTime="476.553" offset="2046464">If it were one of the seven defenses, what the Ninth Circuit has done would be still wrong because there has been no... nothing... no clearly erroneous finding.</text>

            <text syncTime="513.574" offset="2194526">Let me pursue this just a little further, because I'm confused by your answers to Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.264" offset="2221276">Can we not approach this case under the assumption that the term is merely descriptive, but nonetheless determine what the effect is then of the statutory scheme under these circumstances?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_e_popkin" startTime="536.373" stopTime="720.975">
            <label>Mr. Alan E. Popkin</label>
            <text syncTime="536.373" offset="2285746">--Yes, Your Honor, you may approach it in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.991" offset="2296195">We would not concede that the mark is merely descriptive, but our position is that it doesn't matter, because our position is that under the clear language of 1115(b) mere descriptiveness is not a defense to incontestability.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.167" offset="2360874">And in looking at the statutory language there are, of course, many aids and guides that a court can have in unraveling arcane or ambiguous statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.142" offset="2408730">But there's a threshold question and that threshold question is is the statute ambiguous, is it difficult to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.930" offset="2439973">And if it isn't then, as this Court observed in the Escondido case decided last term, statutory language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.472" offset="2486053">Let's look at this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.188" offset="2492949">The language states that:</text>
            <text syncTime="590.274" offset="2501308">"The registration shall be conclusive evidence of the registrant's exclusive right to use the registered mark, except when. "</text>
            <text syncTime="600.982" offset="2544149">--and then they list seven defenses, Congress did, except when one of those defenses or defects is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.969" offset="2572048">The first phrase is "shall be conclusive evidence".</text>
            <text syncTime="612.354" offset="2589602">It's hard to imagine, at least for a person who is used to trying lawsuits, anything clearer than something that says "conclusive evidence", because that means to us that it is, the issue is concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.947" offset="2648012">There is no rebuttal available.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.815" offset="2659506">When the evidence becomes conclusive, that means that the issue is settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.303" offset="2685419">It is interesting to speculate also on what Congress did not say.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.690" offset="2706944">They didn't say that this was conclusive evidence only in a cancellation proceeding, or exclusive or conclusive evidence only when a defensive use was being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.347" offset="2753547">They said that this was conclusive evidence, without limitation on the type of proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.668" offset="2774863">They also didn't say that it was prima facie evidence or admissible in evidence, which they said in the immediately preceding section.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.507" offset="2810285">1115(a) of Title 15 deals with the effect of registration under former Trademark Acts, and there Congress said that this shall be admissible in evidence and shall be prima facie evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.986" offset="2884159">But when they came to the effect of incontestability under the Lanham Act, Congress said it shall be conclusive evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.341" offset="2921566">The next phrase,</text>
            <text syncTime="696.543" offset="2926373">"exclusive right to use the registered mark. "</text>

            <text syncTime="747.942" offset="3132009">I say two things to that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.328" offset="3137547">First of all, that is what... Congress intended the procedure that they put forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.482" offset="3158131">In order for my opponent's position to make sense, we have to presume that an administrative agency, the Patent and Trademark Office, will not do its job properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.104" offset="3204629">Then the mark, after it has been passed upon and some mistake made by the Patent and Trademark Office, presumably, is published in the Trademark Gazette for 30 days so that the world has an opportunity to see it; and then five years of constant use, during which time anybody may step forward and say, I wish to challenge that mark, on any ground without limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.540" offset="3318314">So that the opportunities for review are just extensive for five years, the period of limitations, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.313" offset="3357498">And what I believe, Your Honor, is that Congress balanced the needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.700" offset="3375052">Yes, it is conceivable that the Patent and Trademark Office will make a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.186" offset="3396995">Yes, it is conceivable that somebody situated in Portland, Oregon, or in Poise, Idaho, or somewhere else will not come in contact with that mark during that five years of constant use, so that they won't raise the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.648" offset="3466794">But Congress in its wisdom said, this is a scheme that we believe is appropriate, because the fact that somebody doesn't get to challenge that mark during a period of five years, that doesn't preclude them from having the opportunity to compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.258" offset="3533250">They're free to compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.527" offset="3538265">Just don't use that name.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.544" offset="3546415">Park 'N Fly in this case has many competitors and they don't identify themselves as Park 'N Fly.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.982" offset="3580166">There are a multitude of names available.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.917" offset="3591868">So that the consumer doesn't suffer, and the man who has invested for five years in developing his mark knows at that period of time that there is some stability, that he is not going to be confronted eternally with the same defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.296" offset="3661354">Now, in the final phrase of Section 1115(b) of the statute the Congress says</text>
            <text syncTime="890.169" offset="3700851">"except when one of the following defenses or defects is established. "</text>

            <text syncTime="911.350" offset="3785593">It's an exhaustive list of the substantive trademark defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.569" offset="3806490">1116 of the same Act points out that injunctions are issued according to principles of equity, so equitable defenses such as laches or unclean hands are still available.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.746" offset="3859153">But the substantive trademark defenses are set forth in 1115(b), Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.300" offset="3881410">Now, it's also interesting in helping to interpret this Act to look at the defenses section.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.338" offset="3917563">Defenses four, five and six of the Act set out, amongst other things, the nature of the defenses that can be urged.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.027" offset="3956329">And in using the language and in looking at the language, they talk about the defense being available when a mark is charged to be an infringement, or when the mark whose use by a party is charged to be an infringement, or that the mark whose use is charged as an infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.106" offset="4040652">It is quite clear from the context that what Congress was anticipating was the use of incontestability in an infringement proceeding, and that has to be an offensive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.200" offset="4101047">The interpretation espoused by the Ninth Circuit and adopted by the Respondent here must fail for several reasons, that interpretation, i.e., that there is a dichotomy between offensive and defensive use of the mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.310" offset="4165413">First of all, there is nothing within the four corners of the statute that suggests that or even hints at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.964" offset="4192058">There is nothing, not a syllable, in the legislative history that points to this dichotomous interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.569" offset="4222464">And third, if one looks at Section 1064 of the Act, 1064 concerns itself only with cancellations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.027" offset="4264365">1064(a) and (b) talk in terms of cancellation before five years and 1064(c) talks in terms of what the grounds are for cancellation after five years... precisely the same thing that 1115(b) deals with, the period after five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.291" offset="4349419">If both of those statutes are concerned only with cancellation, they are utter redundancies; one is not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.129" offset="4384737">And we must presume that Congress had something in mind when they enacted both of these sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.616" offset="4410650">And finally, the logical situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.485" offset="4426115">The inherent value in a mark is the ability that it has to identify goods and services, and if the position of the Ninth Circuit is in fact true then Park 'N Fly in each of the cities in which it chooses to operate may have four or five or any number of competitors all of whom will identify themselves as Park 'N Fly, and there will be nothing that Park 'N Fly can do to arrest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.020" offset="4540322">That cannot conceivably, I submit, be the scheme that Congress had in mind when it enacted the Lanham Act Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.360" offset="4573655">There is no basis, as I say, in the statute nor in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.180" offset="4600926">The position taken by the Respondent is that to interpret the statute as we contend would frustrate the purposes of the Lanham Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.219" offset="4637080">And we think and we submit, as our briefs have shown, that the contrary is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.789" offset="4659336">The very purposes of the Lanham Act will be fulfilled, rather than frustrated, by applying the plain meaning of this statute to its interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1966.425" offset="8005935">I'll try to explain, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.242" offset="8013145">Under Section 1064 it says that a mark cannot be cancelled after five years, unless there are certain specific grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.233" offset="8057135">And mere descriptiveness is not one of those grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.935" offset="8067898">Now, this may sound inconsistent to you, but keeping in mind the Congressional scheme it is not, because what Congress wanted to do... the 1905 Act permitted marks to be cancelled at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.509" offset="8126203">A party would have a mark registered for 20 years and then a prior user would come out and cancel that mark after 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.948" offset="8155983">And Congress saw this as an evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.133" offset="8164760">And this is all pointed out in Roberts' book, "The New Trademark Manual", which is very instructive on a lot of these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.454" offset="8190046">Congress wanted to prevent the cancellation of marks after a certain period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.108" offset="8212616">And the reason that a merely descriptive mark should not be cancelled after five years is because possibly it can acquire secondary meaning after that five-year period or at an time, and once it acquires secondary meaning then there is an enforceable cause of action for trademark infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.820" offset="8283460">But we have not reached that point in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2055.014" offset="8360260">The first one is that it will block somebody else trying to register the same or a confusingly similar mark.</text>

            <text syncTime="2082.966" offset="8472064">If secondary meaning was ever acquired, then the registrant could go into court, into federal court, armed with the federal registration and bring a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.906" offset="8507800">A third reason is, under Section 1126 of the Lanham Act... this is a section that refers to registering your mark in foreign countries.</text>
