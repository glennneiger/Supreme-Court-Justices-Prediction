            <text syncTime="67.115" offset="407713">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case concerns the federal government's ability to fire or discipline employees who have engaged in serious misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.741" offset="450241">Under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, an employee who is fired or subjected to another form of so-called adverse agency action may challenge that action in one of two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.449" offset="497052">Any employee may seek to have the action set aside by filing an appeal with the Merit System Protection Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.965" offset="527041">Alternatively, an employee who belongs to a bargaining unit may invoke the grievance procedures set out in the contract between his union and the agency that employs him.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.090" offset="567583">No matter which of the routes the employees follow, the statute sets out the standards of proof and substantive rules that must control the decision in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.606" offset="601646">One of these statutory standards is the harmful error rule, which provides that an employee may have otherwise justified adverse action against him overturned if he is able to demonstrate harmful error in the agency's application of its procedures in arriving at its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.708" offset="666012">Reversal also is in order if the employee may demonstrate that the agency committed harmful error in the application of a procedural rule set out in the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.106" offset="715645">The issue here is the application of this harmful error rule to two federal employees who undoubtedly engaged in serious misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.031" offset="747305">The two were employed by the General Services Administration as officers in the Federal Protective Service when their employer received information that they had falsified law enforcement records to cover up misbehavior and had misused government property.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.999" offset="803207">After conducting an investigation, GSA concluded that the charges had been proved, and it ordered the two employees separated from federal service.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.274" offset="836330">The employees, who were members of a bargaining unit, elected to challenge this action by filing a grievance through the negotiated procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.682" offset="869976">The case went to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.613" offset="881679">The arbitrator found that--</text>

            <text syncTime="205.456" offset="961091">They may differ, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.805" offset="966420">In this case, the arbitrator found that the employees had committed the acts alleged, and that those acts fully justified the separation of the employees from federal service.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.272" offset="1004350">The arbitrator also found that GSA had misinterpreted its contract with the employees' union, and that misinterpretation led it to commit two procedural errors during the investigation into the employees' misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.989" offset="1051161">The employees had not been informed that they had a right to request the presence of a union representative when they were interviewed by investigating agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.937" offset="1090972">And the agency had delayed unnecessarily before informing the employees that they would be fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.358" offset="1108631">But the arbitrator concluded that these procedural mistakes in no way prejudiced the grievance case, did not affect the course of the agency's investigation, and had no impact on the agency's decision to fire the two employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.949" offset="1163070">Despite these findings, however, the arbitrator, in order to penalize the agency, ordered it to reinstate the two employees in the Federal Protective Service after they had served a two-week suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.796" offset="1210404">The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.468" offset="1229108">The court accepted the arbitrator's findings that the grievants had committed the acts alleged and that those acts fully warranted their being removed from federal employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.396" offset="1268814">The court also accepted the arbitrator's finding that the procedural mistakes had no effect on the outcome of the case, and the court acknowledged that the statutory harmful error rule controls arbitral decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.705" offset="1318028">But the court went on to conclude that a union may assert its own institutional interests during the course of an individual employee's adverse action challenge, if that challenge is brought through a negotiated grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.000" offset="1367243">As a result, the court found that an arbitrator must set aside otherwise justified adverse action taken against an employee on account of non-prejudicial that that error was in some undefined sense harmful to the employee's union.</text>

            <text syncTime="382.224" offset="1668174">--The arbitrator focused solely on the procedural mistakes that were made by the agency, and in fact the actions of the employees in this case were serious violations which the arbitrator noted could be subjected to criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.298" offset="1716448">The case had been referred to the United States Attorney, and he delayed taking action because he believed that it could be settled through the agency process.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.284" offset="1744347">So, even violations of law obviously are affected by the arbitrator's decision and the Court of Appeals' affirmance in this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="424.349" offset="1836611">Well, there are two points to make in response to that, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.281" offset="1848314">First, most procedural violations will be addressed during the course of an adverse action challenge anyway, because any consequential violation of the collective bargaining agreement which had an effect or might have affected the agency's decision will be taken into account and may lead to the overturning of adverse action.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.324" offset="1924487">In those cases in which procedural errors had no effect on the agency's decision, the Act gives unions their own distinct remedial procedures that they can use.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.280" offset="1960327">Any union can file a grievance of its own challenging any violation of the collective bargaining agreement, and if it prevails, it might ask the arbitrator to issue a cease and desist order to the offending agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.958" offset="2007034">In clear cases of contractual violations, the union could also file an unfair labor practice charge with the Federal Labor Relations Authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.401" offset="2456863">The harmful error rule forecloses the arbitrator from taking that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.072" offset="2471491">So, to that sense, procedural violations won't be addressed by the arbitrator except to the extent he will prevent the agency from committing... or direct the agency not to commit further violations in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.791" offset="2514437">I think, Your Honor, the interpretation of the harmful error rule that is provided by the Court of Appeals can only benefit one narrow class of federal employee under any reading of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.068" offset="2567517">An employee whose adverse action was affected by procedural error will have that action overturned.</text>

            <text syncTime="649.907" offset="2738881">Well, Congress recognized that there are a variety of advantages to arbitration, and certainly we don't dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.089" offset="2759570">Arbitration is faster and is often less expensive than litigation, and may well be less acrimonious.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.995" offset="2787259">But Congress did not make arbitration preferred in the sense that it intended there would be outcome determinative differences between arbitration and appeals through the Merit Systems Protection Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.000" offset="2827279">It was quite explicit on that, providing that they were to be governed by the same standards and that... in fact, the legislative history said they should be applied identically.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.375" offset="2860716">So, I don't think arbitration was the preferred method in the sense that it intended every employee with a claim of procedural error to go to arbitration because he knew that he would win in arbitration and might not win before the Merit Systems Protection Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.574" offset="2909512">But that in fact is the only... the only category of employees who are benefitted by the Court of Appeals' ruling are those who have been demonstrated to be unfit for federal service who are challenging a procedural error that concededly did not effect the outcome of their case, and who chose to go through the negotiated grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.349" offset="2988611">And this result, for a variety of reasons, is clearly not what Congress intended when it enacted the Civil Service Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.790" offset="3014420">I think the problem with the Court of Appeals decision is plain on the face of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.895" offset="3038766">In so many words, the Act places on the affected employee the burden of demonstrating that harmful procedural error was committed while the agency was arriving at its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.282" offset="3076383">Given any straightforward reading, this appears to place on the employee the burden of demonstrating that the agency's result in the case might have been affected by the error, and that is the definition of the term given by the Merit Systems Protection Board, which is the agency that is given responsibility for interpreting the Act's standard of proof provisions, and it is the only interpretation that gives effect to the full Congressional purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="986.310" offset="4084500">When Congress placed the harmful error rule in the statute to address these problems, it did so expressly to provide that a federal employee adverse action would not be overturned simply because of technical or procedural mistakes on the part of their employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.512" offset="4161300">And it did this with the express purpose of overcoming the widely held view that federal employees cannot be fired no matter how egregious or unacceptable their conduct, and it cannot be consistent with this intent to keep employees on the federal payroll after they have been demonstrated unfit simply because their employer committed a concededly non-prejudicial procedural mistake while attempting to fire them, but that is the effect of the Court of Appeals' ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.108" offset="4259625">That is its primary effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.450" offset="4265059">Here, for example, the court reinstated in the Federal Protective Service two employees after the arbitrator, in his own words, found that their actions had rendered them unworthy of their employer's trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.467" offset="4313124">And the decision will lead to other results that Congress wished to avoid as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.491" offset="4329215">While the Civil Service Reform Act gives unions broad leeway to negotiate the procedural rights, it also insists that arbitrators and the Merit Systems Protection Board apply identical standards in judging adverse action challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.270" offset="4392327">Congress placed that provision in the Act expressly to promote consistency between board and arbitral decisions, and to prevent forum shopping on the part of the aggrieved employees between those two decision-makers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.338" offset="4432556">But it seems undeniable that the Court of Appeals decision will frustrate both of those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.741" offset="4454185">It guarantees that there will be inconsistent decisions because it establishes two entirely distinct harmful error rules, one to be applied by the board, one to be applied by arbitrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.618" offset="4493682">Had one of the employees in this case gone to the board, for example, he would have lost, while his identically situated co-worker was being returned to his job at the Federal Protective Service by the arbitrator's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.315" offset="4540494">And this state of affairs in turn guarantees that forum shopping will occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.637" offset="4557735">The Act gives the aggrieved employee the right to choose between which two forums he will bring his challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.122" offset="4583752">If employees realize that arbitrators are applying their own outcome-determinative, more generous standards in cases involving procedural error, every sensible bargaining unit employee who has a procedural claim will choose to go through the negotiated grievance route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.393" offset="4648850">The result will be consistently more favorable treatment for the 60 percent of federal employees who are bargaining unit members than for the 40 percent who are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.127" offset="4679779">Not only is this result inequitable, but it distorts the procedural scheme that Congress envisioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.122" offset="4703707">The Act establishes a single uniform system for disposing of adverse action challenges which gives the bargaining unit employee the right to choose between two... what are supposed to be two roughly equivalent fora for bringing their appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.061" offset="4759504">While Congress certainly recognized that a variety of factors would impel employees to choose one route rather than the other for their challenges, the Act's emphasis on consistency makes it plain that one of those factors should not be the existence of substantive rules that make one forum predictably more likely to grant relief than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.194" offset="4835991">The Court of Appeals sidestepped all of these considerations by asserting that the union's role as the representative of the employee in an adverse action challenge means that it can assert its own institutional interests during the course of the employee's adverse action appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.792" offset="4898371">But this reasoning is squarely inconsistent with the language and purposes of the harmful error rule and with the Act's emphasis on consistency between board and arbitral judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.600" offset="4937659">As noted before, the emphasis of the adverse action procedures is squarely on the protected employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1427.349" offset="5848601">The question is, does the arbitral award violate the harmful error provision of the Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.004" offset="5875246">It is not disputed that if the award is not inconsistent with the Reform Act, it should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.218" offset="5904086">We contend that the Court of Appeals correctly decided that the extension of the harmful error rule to be applicable to important rights of the rest of the members of the collective bargaining unit, the collective rights, if you will, of employees represented by the union, is entirely consistent with law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.702" offset="5994051">The government claims specifically that only error harmful to the rights of the individual grievant may be considered in the arbitral context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.890" offset="6046819">This contention is based on an interpretation of the statute by the Merit Systems Protection Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="1526.284" offset="6244409">In that situation, which happened the previous year, again, the agency had not provided the grievant with the opportunity to be represented by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.782" offset="6290384">So the arbitrator in this case, knowing that this violation had occurred just the previous year, would, I suggest, be reluctant just to issue a cease and desist order, because he knows the agency last year did exactly the same thing, and was put on notice by another arbitrator not to do it again, and yet they go ahead and do exactly the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1590.014" offset="6499259">In this case, these were police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.716" offset="6510126">One of them... both of them were accused of tampering with agency records to cover up misconduct, and the arbitrator recognized that the employee who had access to agency records should not be returned to that position, specifically ordered that upon reinstatement this employee should not be returned to a position of trust such as he had occupied before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.014" offset="6615243">The other employee, who was not directly involved in that kind of tampering with records, Mr. Rogers, who was just guilty, if you will, of picking up the beer and misusing a government vehicle for that purpose, there was no such limitation in his case because it was not appropriate in view of the facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.692" offset="6726002">Now, of course, that involves a certain amount of trust, but it is not the same as being a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.655" offset="6745855">Our point is that in this award, the arbitrator did not violate the statute, he only violated an interpretation of the statute made by the Merit Systems Protection Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="2295.628" offset="9321738">It says that a particular penalty is not appropriate, constitutes an abuse of discretion or an abuse of authority, based on many factors, and mitigates a penalty without using the harmful error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.606" offset="9381610">It is important to realize here the nature of the differences between the arbitral context and the Merit Systems Protection Board, and how Congress specified in the statute arbitration and collective bargaining were to fit into the overall scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.380" offset="9456739">Taking the latter first, in Title 7 of the Civil Service Reform Act, even the government does not dispute that collective bargaining is of primary importance, and that the intent of the statute was to promote collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.409" offset="9520895">In that scheme, arbitration was expressly the mechanism by which the procedures negotiated in collective bargaining were to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.496" offset="9565199">This can easily be seen when you realize that in the previous scheme, under the executive order, Executive Order 11491, arbitration was not mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.175" offset="9615877">The Congress expressly departed from this past practice, if you will, by mandating arbitration in the new scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.721" offset="9650149">They also departed from the scheme under the executive order by requiring or by permitting, I should say, that adverse actions could be aggrieved and arbitrated under the new scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.216" offset="9696125">In the past, adverse actions had been excluded, had been excluded from the coverage of grievance procedures negotiated by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.864" offset="9734681">In view of the fact that the union is the one who selects an arbitrator, in fact, invokes, has the authority whether or not to invoke arbitration, and the union has the authority to negotiate the exclusion of adverse actions from the arbitral process, the union jointly with the agency selects the arbitrator, pays the arbitrator, pays the costs of the arbitration, in view of all of these circumstances expressed in the language of the Act, the Courts of Appeals have found that the union is an important party in the arbitral process, a party whose significant interests are to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.675" offset="9929973">The government implies in their argument that some kind of a per se rule is here involved, that any kind of violation of a collective bargaining agreement could cause an arbitrator to throw out this discipline that has been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.666" offset="9989846">In a later case, Devine versus Brisco, the Federal Circuit addressed this exact question, and held that there must be a demonstration by the union of prejudice to its rights, and the kind of demonstration that the Court was talking about in Brisco was exactly what occurred here, and they referred to this, the filing of an unfair labor practice charge indicating that the union in fact believed that its rights had been prejudiced to the degree that they are going to file a charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.035" offset="10111367">In the face of Brisco, I think that this argument of the government cannot really be given any credence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.871" offset="10146685">Clearly, the Federal Circuit, which has been charged with the oversight of this whole arbitral process, has determined that contractual violations which are demonstrably harmful to the union have to be considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="3253.002" offset="13151184">There is no reason to believe that the board would ever take a union's institutional rights into account, because the board's own regulation defines harmful error as error that affects or might have affected the outcome of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.390" offset="13200817">It follows from that we are not arguing that the arbitrator here abused his discretion, or that the arbitrator was wrong because he departed from the board's interpretation of the harmful error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.869" offset="13250659">The arbitrator was incorrect because he departed from the statutory standard that Congress laid down to control in a parallel way both the decisions of the board and the decisions of arbitrators.</text>

            <text syncTime="3419.332" offset="13816575">That is right, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.563" offset="13821486">Congress explicitly gave employees a choice, one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.776" offset="13834339">And to answer one of your questions, Chief Justice Burger, there is no indication in the opinion of the Court of Appeals or the arbitrator that the type of crime or violation committed by the employees should make any difference in the remedy that is provided, because it is not the employee's situation which is being considered by the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.028" offset="13919289">It is the violation of the union's institutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.521" offset="13929320">And in either case, no matter what the employee did, that violation presumably is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.313" offset="13948441">I think two quick final points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.027" offset="13971325">There certainly is no reason to believe that arbitration will be made meaningless in any sense if inconsequential procedural errors cannot lead to the overturning of adverse agency action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.744" offset="14014166">Any important violation would be remedied in precisely the same way that it would be remedied before the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.769" offset="14034332">In fact, coming to any other conclusion would be entirely inconsistent with the Congressional emphasis on avoiding forum shopping.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.543" offset="14065366">It seems undeniable that forum shopping will occur if the arbitrators are permitted to take into account the violations that the board, by statute and by its regulations, cannot take into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.529" offset="14109356">Finally, one final point, it is true that there are a variety of management rights that are not negotiable with unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.834" offset="14134538">One of the things which the federal circuit has also found is not negotiable is the harmful error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.628" offset="14153764">A union and an agency cannot agree to dispense with the harmful error rule because Congress believed it was so important that unfit federal employees not be retained on the federal work force because of inconsequential procedural mistakes.</text>
