            <text syncTime="51.225" offset="337658">In my petition for certiorari, I asked the Court to establish for the first time a standard by which all courts, particularly our Court, can have to determine when and when not surgery can be mandated upon a defendant in a criminal case to recover from his body evidence that would be used in the prosecution of that person for a crime which it is alleged that he committed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1265.779" offset="5195911">I just didn't want there to be any question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.273" offset="5205942">In regard to the risks, Mr. Garrett has suggested this morning that the Medical College of Virginia has never lost a patient in a minor procedure of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.932" offset="5268531">I don't believe that that assertion is supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.265" offset="5281906">If my recollection is correct, there are some mortality statistics quoted on a study done at the Medical College of Virginia, and the mortality statistic was greater than zero, and that means that somebody has died.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.084" offset="5341152">So I don't believe that that assertion would be supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.537" offset="5362990">I believe that the test that is being urged on the Court by the petitioners is simply a major-minor surgery distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.604" offset="5403219">I think at Page 12 of the petitioners' brief petitioners flat out state, if the medical personnel characterize the surgery as minor, no constitutional violation; if the medical personnel characterize the surgery as major, then constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.219" offset="5489632">And even if the reasonableness test as opposed to the per se test is the proper test for the Court to adopt, I don't think the Court can adopt that position of having the Court simply delegate to a witness the ultimate question before it, and particularly a question of constitutional magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.472" offset="5562670">Any reasonableness test, I think, is a balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.742" offset="5575731">I think that there has first got to be a need, and secondly, the inquiry has to go to the invasion of the privacy or the affront to the dignity of the individual and the risk.</text>

            <text syncTime="2429.633" offset="9851349">And then whether you have the bullet to make the comparison with, the replicate firing from Mr. Watkinson's gun, that is only half the story, because then you go back to the questioned specimen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.952" offset="9904639">Now, that questioned specimen could have been damaged on its entry into the body, and in fact Dr. Mendez-Picon did testify, printed at Page 34 of the Joint Appendix, that it was damaged in hitting the collarbone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.953" offset="9972662">It retained its cylindrical state, but it was damaged somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.965" offset="9984678">It was bent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.836" offset="9988127">So, there has been some damage to the bullet that we know about in its entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.338" offset="10002128">And then the firearms identification expert testified that the length, the deterioration to the bullet from the bodily fluids is positively correlated with the passage of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.488" offset="10054791">He could not testify as to any particular rate at which that deterioration would occur, but there is a positive correlation, and furthermore, since he knew the gun was a.32 caliber revolver, he says, well, that pretty much limits you to a lead bullet, and that is apparently the softest substance out of which bullets are made, and I think his wording was that they deteriorate much faster.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.523" offset="10146847">And so, I think it is entirely speculative as to whether or not there is going to be any possibility to identify that bullet after two and a half years, and if the bullet after two and a half years, and if the bullet comes cut and it is not identifiable, they have nothing more than what they have now, and they can show... they bring in the doctor and show that he was treated for a gunshot wound, and bring in the doctor and say, here's the ex-ray, this little white spot is the bullet, and do that whether or not they are allowed to comment upon the refusal to allow the surgery.</text>

I think the reading of the cases shows that for that kind of operation, you don't even need... you don't need to go to the hospital.</text>

            <text syncTime="2743.830" offset="11108153">And I think that the invasion of privacy and affront to dignity, I don't see how it could be any greater than when the doctor is actually going to be breathing for the man.</text>
