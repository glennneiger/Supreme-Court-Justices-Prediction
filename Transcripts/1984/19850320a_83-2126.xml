            <text syncTime="74.881" offset="434399">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the issues in this case which primarily arise under the principles announced by this Court in United States versus Ross are as follows: first, whether there was probable cause to believe that the defendants' vehicle in this case contained contraband, and secondly, assuming there was such probable cause, whether the police acted properly in searching without a search warrant three suitcases in the trunk of the car and the bandaid box which was found on the dashboard of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.852" offset="562294">Of course, the state contends that the answer to these questions is in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.637" offset="581416">The facts in the present case are that at noon on the day in question, Officer Taylor, a narcotics officer with the Oklahoma City Police Department, received a telephone call from a confidential informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.462" offset="624779">The informant stated that he had been within the room in question, Room 113, within the last ten hours and had observed a large quantity of marijuana, some cocaine, and some other white pills.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.020" offset="674934">The informant stated that some of the drugs in question were in a blue suitcase.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.074" offset="691130">The informant gave the officer a description of the men that were in the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.458" offset="708684">The informant also stated that one of the names of the men who were in the room was named Tim Castleberry, and that the other man was named Nick.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.881" offset="738360">The informant stated that these men were driving a blue 1980 or '81 Thunderbird with Florida license plates.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.368" offset="764378">Officer Taylor took this information and immediately proceeded to the motel in question, which is located on an interstate highway in Oklahoma City--</text>

            <label>Mr. David William Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="173.211" offset="827698">--Yes, Your Honor, the informant specifically told the officer that some of the narcotics was in a blue suitcase which was... which the informant stated that he had observed in the last ten hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.499" offset="872838">Officer Taylor drove to the motel, went in, and drove through the parking lot and observed parked in front of Room 113, the room which the informant had referred to, he noticed parked immediately in front of the room a blue 1980 or '81 Thunderbird with Florida license plates.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.361" offset="940338">Taylor parked his car, went in, and found out from the room clerk that the room was registered to Tim Castleberry, which is the name of the person referred to by the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.181" offset="971581">He said Castleberry had paid for only the previous night, and that checkout time was at 1:00 p.m., and that he would be leaving at 1:00 p.m. At this time, it was approximately ten minutes until l: 00 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.422" offset="1016616">The officer then returned to the car, which was approximately five space away from the blue Thunderbird, and called for a backup.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.909" offset="1042529">While waiting there for his backup to arrive, he observed the defendant Castleberry come from Room 113 carrying a blue suitcase which matched the description of the one given to him by the informant which stated that some of the narcotics were in that particular suitcase.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.486" offset="1100835">Taylor watched him put the blue suitcase in the trunk of the Thunderbird.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.806" offset="1118075">He then saw the defendant Raineri also leave Room 113 carrying two green plaid suitcases, which he also observed him place these in the trunk of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.762" offset="1157886">He then observed Castleberry come out of the room a second time and place a blue suitcase in the back seat of the car behind the driver's side.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.434" offset="1188606">At this time Officer Taylor felt like he needed to take action.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.653" offset="1205533">He got out of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.469" offset="1208773">He drew his gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.255" offset="1211907">He approached the two men.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.321" offset="1216191">He advised them he was an Oklahoma City police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.390" offset="1228417">He stated that... he had his badge displayed and his gun pulled.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.342" offset="1244299">He asked both men to place their hands on the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.194" offset="1255689">It should be noted that there was a third person come out of the room who at this time stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="284.515" offset="1272929">"I am not involved in any of this. "</text>
            <text syncTime="286.215" offset="1279721">"I am scared. "</text>
            <text syncTime="286.798" offset="1282020">"I am not any good at this. "</text>
            <text syncTime="288.317" offset="1288185">In response to the request by the officer... and I need to add that Officer Taylor testified that as he approached the trunk of the car, he was able to detect a strong odor of marijuana coming from the trunk of the car, which was open.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.309" offset="1344087">He said after he gave his command, Castleberry, who was standing on the driver's side of the car, near the trunk, slammed the trunk shut.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.665" offset="1377524">He said that the defendant Raineri, who was standing on the passenger side of the car, immediately complied with the request, but Castleberry, after slamming the trunk shut, stepped back further toward the driver's side and placed his hands behind his back.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.156" offset="1431545">The officer testified that he gave Castleberry two more commands to put his hands on the car, and Castleberry refused, and finally threw an object into the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.579" offset="1469161">Officer Taylor approached and attempted to force him to place his hands on the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.816" offset="1490164">A certain amount of wrestling ensued, and they both went to the ground while Officer Taylor was trying to subdue Castleberry.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.569" offset="1517122">During this time, Castleberry was able to reach up, lock the inside of the driver's car, and slam the door shut.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.707" offset="1537707">The car keys to the car were at this time in the door on the driver's side of the car where the two men were.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.527" offset="1568949">At this time the backup, Officer Citty of the Oklahoma City Police Department arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.515" offset="1588907">He stated and it was the testimony of both these men that he came up, that he was given the keys to the car by Officer Taylor, and advised by Officer Taylor that he had smelled an odor of marijuana coming from the trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.256" offset="1639898">He took the keys, opened the trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.025" offset="1647003">He, too, said he smelled an odor of marijuana coming from the trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.977" offset="1658810">He unzipped the two plaid suitcases that the defendant Raineri had taken from the room and placed in the car, and he found there a large amount of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.998" offset="1694859">There were 25 pounds of marijuana in one of the suitcases and 34 pounds of marijuana in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.069" offset="1715130">He then proceeded to... he had to forcefully open the blue suitcase that the defendant Raineri had... defendant Castleberry had brought from the room and placed in the car first.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.592" offset="1753269">He forcefully opened that, and in that suitcase was found $2,700 in cash and approximately ten ounces of methaqualone.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.781" offset="1790049">The state contends, of course, that the search of these four containers, the three suitcases which were found in the trunk and the bandaid box on the dashboard, were properly conducted without a warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="544.316" offset="2312185">It is the bandaid box.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.799" offset="2314066">We think that the suitcases and the bandaid box were all searched pursuant to the automobile exception rule in Ross and of course the more recent case announced by this Court, United States versus Johns.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.854" offset="2350324">We also feel that the bandaid box was properly searched as a search incident to a lawful custodial arrest under the doctrines of this Court in United States versus Robinson and New York versus Belton.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.012" offset="2394941">It is the state's position that the officers had probable cause to believe that the vehicle in question contained contraband, and that a search of the entire vehicle for drugs was justified by the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.220" offset="2439767">The fact that checkout time was at hand, that the baggage had been loaded into the car, that the informant had stated that some... that one of the suitcases contained drugs, that a strong odor of marijuana was coming from the trunk, coupled with the actions of the defendant Castleberry and the third party as Officer Taylor approached the car, all support the belief that the drugs had been removed from somewhere in the motel room and were now somewhere in the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.037" offset="2551049">Therefore, the entire automobile could have been a hideaway for the drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.922" offset="2566618">This Court specifically held in the Johns case that when the officers approached the trucks in question and detected the distinct odor of marijuana which was around the back of the truck, they had probable cause to search the entire truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.980" offset="2618758">The Court in Johns stated also that the officers in the Ross case had probable cause to search the entire vehicle in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.836" offset="2654180">The state believes that the facts in this case present an even more compelling case involving probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.155" offset="2675496">In this case, the convictions of the defendant were reversed by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in a two-to-one decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.476" offset="2700782">The court stated the reason why they reversed was because they felt like if an officer had tried to apply the Ross and the Sanders and the Chadwick doctrine, they felt like that taking all those cases together, that if an officer knows of the specific location within a vehicle where contraband is located, the officer should get a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.973" offset="2782807">However, if he only knows that there is contraband generally in the vehicle, the officer can go ahead and search it without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.477" offset="2812795">The court held in this case since the suitcases and the bandaid box were suspected locations of contraband, they should have been detained while the search warrant was being obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.101" offset="2855323">However, in the Johns case, the Court observed that when the officers detected the odor of marijuana coming from the back of the trucks, they no doubt suspected that the odor was coming from the packages which were in the back of the truck, but the Court, of course, in that case did not require a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.878" offset="2918435">In Ross, the police were advised of the specific location of drugs in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.596" offset="2937243">In that case they were advised by an informant that the drugs were in the trunk, but this Court upheld the search of the brown paper bag and the zippered pouch in the trunk of the car without requiring a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.504" offset="2992936">Under the same rationale, the search of the suitcases found in the trunk in the present case should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.724" offset="3017804">The rule announced by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals we feel means that there would now be endless litigation over whether or not the police suspected of a particular location of contraband within a particular container in a vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.519" offset="3080916">Furthermore, this Court in Johns specifically noted that the fact that a container is involved does not in itself either expand or contract the well-established exception to the warrant principle recognized in the Carroll case.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.160" offset="3127519">In Ross this Court stated that there was no distinction between containers and compartments, and that the object of the search is limited... and that the officer's search is limited only by the object of the search, and the places in which there is probable cause to believe that that object may be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.704" offset="3197736">In both Ross and Johns and in Justice Powell's concurring opinion in the Robins case it was noted that in neither Sanders nor in the Chadwick case did the police have probable cause to search the vehicle or anything in it other than the footlocker in the Chadwick case and the suitcase in the Sanders case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1097.903" offset="4526533">We think the fact that at gunpoint he refused two commands to place his hands on the car, that he finally threw the item, the bandaid box in the car, that he struggled with the police officer, that he locked the car and slammed the door shut during the process of this, he obviously didn't want the police to get the bandaid box, and he obviously didn't want them to get in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.901" offset="4606467">He didn't want them to get in the trunk of the car, too, because the actions of Castleberry in slamming the trunk shut as he approached, as the officer approached the car, should also be considered, I think, to be a probable cause fact.</text>
