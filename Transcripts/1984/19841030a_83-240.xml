            <text syncTime="95.024" offset="508186">The federal statute known as Payment in Lieu of Taxes, or its acronym, PILT, is perhaps a new concept of awarding federal funds for the non-taxable lands by conferring upon local communities, local units of government, the discretion of how these funds may be best spent to offset the impact caused by the presence of federal lands within their particular communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.463" offset="657920">It is the result of years of careful study as to how most effectively to offset this adverse impact of federal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.490" offset="702015">And it substitutes prior programs of designated use, such as designation for school districts or designation of roads, to allow the discretionary use by these governmental units and with the only caveat that they be for any governmental purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.385" offset="805669">The program is rather broad.</text>

            <text syncTime="1297.807" offset="5319315">This statute, that is, the federal statute, very pointedly directs that the payments be made made to the local government units, the general government units of the locality and not to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.082" offset="5380441">It would have been much simpler for the federal payment to be made to the state and to leave the state free to make the distribution as it saw fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.532" offset="5414191">Congress chose to do otherwise, and the legislative history tells us why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.592" offset="5438433">There had been an experience of making payments to the state with a view to the state's redistributing the funds to the affected locality, and all too often the state had failed to redistribute in the way Congress had expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.788" offset="5495275">Accordingly, on this occasion, Congress very clearly said we distrust the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.597" offset="5522443">We will pay directly to the affected county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.816" offset="5535399">It is our intention that they be reimbursed for the burdens our land management imposes on them, and that the money remain there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1373.823" offset="5623380">It is true that in this instance, Justice Rehnquist, the state statute did not require the funds to be expended outside the geographic area of the county, but it did require that 60 percent of those funds be allocated to a school district, a school district whose needs were in no way increased by the presence of federal land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.750" offset="5715122">On the contrary, the federal land is forest land, for the most part, which is--</text>

            <text syncTime="1403.811" offset="5743334">But had that land been taxed, had it been sold to individual, had it been subject to taxation, presumably families would have lived on it and the school burden would have been increased accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.087" offset="5800490">Therefore, it would have been appropriate to increase the allocation to the school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.006" offset="5824105">Here, it is wholly inappropriate to allocate 60 percent of these federal funds which do not merely stand in lieu of the taxes, but which were intended to compensate for quite different burdens which federal ownership of the land imposes, as distinguished from private ownership of that same land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.045" offset="5908324">Now, the point of having the payments go to the county and not to the state is importantly injured, if not destroyed, when the state is free to seize those monies as soon as they reach the country treasury, and redistribute them as it sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.114" offset="5988572">We might as well have given the money directly to the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1489.495" offset="6086061">If you read the statute as requiring the payment to the county so that the county will have discretion as to how to spend it, that is one thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1645.590" offset="6710492">And Your Honor's analogy seems to me sound; that is, that if the money is accepted on those conditions, those conditions are enforceable no matter who the grantor may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.585" offset="6766394">Now, finally, as an indication that this state statute does offend the federal purpose, one looks to Section 3 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.611" offset="6810593">This case concerns Section 1 which involves the bulk of the funds, but Section 3 is a special provision which says in the event a national park or a wilderness is created out of land which was taxed just before and which is now removed from the tax roles, for five years there shall be a payment which will substitute for the taxes which have been lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.040" offset="6900245">And there, Congress directs that the allocation be as the taxes were the previous year, partly to the school district and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.146" offset="6940683">Now, what South Dakota has done is said we will impose the Section 3 formula on Section 1 funds, thereby destroying the whole point of Congress's making the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.640" offset="6986658">Now, that is a plain indication of how hostile these two provisions are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.826" offset="7011422">Now, one might wonder why the Federal Government cares, whether we're not simply intruding ourselves in a family argument between a county and a school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.462" offset="7057920">The government cares, first, because Congress had in mind benefitting a locality and not whatever agency of government the state might choose to benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.315" offset="7113404">The least populous counties probably have the least voice in the state legislature and therefore they are not likely to failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.545" offset="7162306">The government was concerned that those who suffered the burden from our presence be the ones who benefitted from our funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.166" offset="7196787">The government also, since these funds were meant to recompense for burdens imposed by us, felt some degree of duty to see to it that the funds were available and used for providing the services that our lands required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.752" offset="7279125">And, duty aside, our self-interest was that the counties have the funds available and that they not be deflected to the school board or elsewhere, but that they be available to furnish the services to our lands which otherwise we would have to contract and pay for elsewhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="1817.754" offset="7399079">And Congress had to choose whether flexibility or trust with respect to the county was most appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.017" offset="7432203">Congress took it that the county could be trusted in its special relationship with the federal managers to expend at least a measurable portion of those funds on providing the services to the federal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.855" offset="7499494">And let me say in the day-to-day management of the federal lands, there is a relationship between the federal managers and the county officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.539" offset="7534289">That relationship is indispensable to the success of the federal land program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.614" offset="7558531">It is one which is measurably aided by the presence of federal funds to compensate for the burdens the government imposes, but it is only useful if the county is assured that those funds are not deflected or confiscated or otherwise directed by the state to be used elsewhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="3076.937" offset="12435801">This is the only statute in the country that seems... or the only state in the country that seems it is necessary to make some reallocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.541" offset="12494315">Mr. Justice White asked whether this will be a windfall for the taxpayers of that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.226" offset="12520960">That certainly was not the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.068" offset="12528379">The purpose in granting discretion for the presence of these lands was that the benefits would redound to the landholder, the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.845" offset="12575504">And the funds are those from the taxpayers of the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.421" offset="12597760">No other state has felt it necessary to take away this local discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.965" offset="12620017">Arkansas attempted, in a somewhat different manner, and Arkansas failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.134" offset="12652617">So there is no necessity to instruct the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.884" offset="12667664">And this Court, in an unbroken line of decision since Chief Justice Marshall, has held that the purpose and intent of intent of Congress in trying to accommodate both state and federal statutes, must look to the intent and purpose of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.374" offset="12741643">There is no doubt in this question that Congress is acting in a field in which it has authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.669" offset="12766825">This is land management, given to it by the Constitution, and it also involves the spending power of Congress under what conditions Congress would impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.728" offset="12811024">Certainly, the legislative history and, we would submit, the Act itself says that its main purpose and intent is to confer upon counties discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.349" offset="12857522">The South Dakota statute... and indeed if it is upheld, other states would follow... removes that discretion, supplants the local community where the lands are located--</text>
