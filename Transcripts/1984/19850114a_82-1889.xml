            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="115087">We will hear arguments first this morning in Springfield Township School District against Knoll.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.857" offset="146434">Mr. Potash, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_potash" startTime="11.460" stopTime="406.937">
            <label>Mr. Charles Potash</label>
            <text syncTime="11.460" offset="160854">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case squarely presents to the Court the question whether a state statute of limitations applicable to the commencement of judicial proceedings should be disregarded in a Section 1983 suit solely on the ground that the limitation period, six months, is per se unreasonably short, and consequently inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.498" offset="284987">Respondent commenced suit on April 21st, 1981, to redress alleged discrimination on the basis of sex by her employer, the School District of Springfield Township.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.238" offset="335978">One of her claims sought relief under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.059" offset="351234">In the alternative, respondent sought relief under Section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.374" offset="380491">Under her theory, the last act of discrimination occurred in September of 1980, some seven or eight months earlier, when a man was appointed as assistant superintendent, a job for which she had not applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.534" offset="433154">The school district defendants moved for summary judgment, one of the grounds being that the Section 1983 claim was barred by the Pennsylvania state statute of limitations governing certain actions against public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.712" offset="485921">The District Court agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.963" offset="494907">The Court of Appeals in a panel decision reversed the dismissal of the 1983 claim on the ground that the six-month statute of limitations was so short as to be inherently inconsistent with the policies fostered by the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.293" offset="564184">The school district defendants applied for rehearing, and the application was denied, with four judges voting to grant the rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.710" offset="597830">Now, there is no question in this case that the statute at issue was properly identified as the most appropriate state statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.628" offset="641507">Therefore the question left for resolution is what the Court labeled in the recent case of Burnett versus Cratton as the third step in a Section 1983 inquiry, that is, is the state statute inconsistent with federal law?</text>
            <text syncTime="148.518" offset="709111">I submit that this inquiry should be confined to a determination whether the state statute discriminates against federal rights or provides so short a time so as to effectively preclude litigating a civil rights claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.180" offset="775776">It is clear that the Pennsylvania statute does not directly conflict with the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.943" offset="802839">The statute does not discriminate against federal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.876" offset="818512">It was not enacted with any intent to discriminate against federal claims, nor is there any hostility toward any civil rights action.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.092" offset="855397">It applies to both state and federal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.285" offset="868145">A more cogent reason is found in the holding of the Third Circuit which held it was the analogous statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.491" offset="905030">Implicit in this finding was that the state and federal law claims were being treated equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.816" offset="930316">Here there is no basis for rejection of the Pennsylvania statute on the ground that it discriminates against federal civil rights actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.151" offset="971590">The six-month statute of limitations at issue in this case is one expressly applicable to the commencement of judicial proceedings rather than administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.600" offset="1021431">The limitation period applies to judicial remedies enforceable in court in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.274" offset="1048181">It does not limit who may bring suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.125" offset="1055495">It does not preclude money damages or injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.898" offset="1070646">For these reasons, its enactment should raise a presumption that the legislature took into account the burden of the parties to the suit governed by the limitation, and the practicalities involved in litigating civil rights claims, and found the limitation period to be a reasonable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.749" offset="1145983">The determination of the Pennsylvania legislature that a six-month period is a reasonable one within which to commence litigation, whether in a state or federal court, is given support by the holding of the Court in DelCostello versus the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.212" offset="1219858">That case impliedly recognized that a six-month limitation period was sufficient for the commencement of relatively complex federal litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.209" offset="1259877">That case cuts across any conclusion that the practicalities of litigation necessarily mean that a six-month period is an unreasonable time in which to bring a federal cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="990.058" offset="4075250">Most significantly, however, the prompt assertion of claims by the filing of complaints of discrimination on the public record would foster deterrence of unlawful conduct by public officials in addition to putting the governing body on early notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1020.959" offset="4198862">Prompt, well-founded accusations against public officials for discrimination in hiring or promotion on the basis of sex would increase the likelihood that they would be accountable for their violations of the federal rights of others.</text>

            <text syncTime="1191.019" offset="4879090">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, although we believe that this case can and should be decided on narrow grounds, the petitioners suggest that it implicates certain broad principles set forth by this Court in Tomanio, in Robertson, and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.671" offset="4953696">Accordingly, we think it is appropriate at the outset to make clear what is and what is not at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.756" offset="4986088">We are not contending that a state statute of limitations is simply a technical obstacle to be circumvented if possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.253" offset="5024018">We recognize, as this Court indicated in Tomanio, that in most cases these statutes are binding rules of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.448" offset="5056827">Nor do we contend that a state statute of limitations should be rejected merely because it would cause a litigant to lose the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.924" offset="5094757">Again, we recognize, as this Court has stated in Robertson, there must be some cutoff point in most cases, and inevitably some plaintiffs will fall on the far side of the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.562" offset="5149301">We make a much more focused argument, an argument that fits comfortably within the framework established by the principles set forth by this Court in prior cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.901" offset="5198620">What we are contending is that this particular Pennsylvania statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.726" offset="5225892">Section 5527(b)(1), should not be borrowed because its application would be inconsistent with the federal policy underlying Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.225" offset="5275943">That policy, as this Court has made clear on numerous occasions, most recently in the Burnett case last term, is to augment the remedies that are available to individuals whose federal constitutional or statutory rights are abridged by state action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1384.468" offset="5652942">And in response to your question, Justice O'Connor, it is a residuary statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.781" offset="5674153">It applies only to those types of lawsuits which the Pennsylvania legislature considered so uncommon or so unusual that they did not make subject to a more specific statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.453" offset="5728801">The point we make at the footnote is, they never considered this, because it was a residuary statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1409.366" offset="5752520">Isn't there some precedent in the state and the federal courts sitting in Pennsylvania for the proposition that it should have been treated as a breach of implied contract claim?</text>

            <text syncTime="1468.863" offset="5990444">I think both the District Court and the Court of Appeals agreed that the Pennsylvania courts would have applied this six-month residuary statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.009" offset="6023045">Because of these features of this statute, we believe that this Court can decide this case on narrow grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.364" offset="6060452">It need not reach the more basic question of six months per se is too short for instituting a 1983 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.051" offset="6099218">Quite apart from the answer to that question, it would, we submit, as the Third Circuit found as a wholly independent ground for its decision, not simply because six months was unreasonably short, the Third Circuit found as an independent ground for its decision that the application of this statute of limitations would be inconsistent with the policies underlying Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.990" offset="6211022">Let me begin by focusing on some of the features of this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.764" offset="6234114">To begin with, six months is an abbreviated time limit by any comparative standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.048" offset="6263267">Certainly that is true within the overall limitations schema in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.601" offset="6285418">There is no statute of limitations in Pennsylvania that requires the bringing of any lawsuit in court for less than six months, and there are only three other statutes of limitations, narrowly focused causes of action, essentially in the Uniform Commercial Code area, which have a six-month statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.345" offset="6364413">Even for those actions that depend most heavily on conduct and unwritten evidence, such as assault, or slander, or personal injury, the Pennsylvania legislature has established minimum statutes of limitations of one year and up to six.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.667" offset="6441735">It almost never drops below the one-year threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.590" offset="6457409">And there is a similar pattern in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.163" offset="6471724">It is extremely rare to find any statute of limitations below one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.377" offset="6496592">There are some that go at six months, but invariably they are Uniform Commercial Code actions involving highly sophisticated parties on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.434" offset="6540791">In sum, what we have here is an abbreviated statute of limitations at the extreme low end of the continuum, and it should be noted that this is particularly significant because we have a residuary statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.494" offset="6609023">In most states residuary statutes run five, seven, even ten years, reflecting a broad legislative judgment that when you deal with the unknown, you give the benefit of the doubt to the potential plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.375" offset="6676524">The Pennsylvania legislature in this statute of limitations turns that presumption on its head, and it comes up with a residuary statute of six months.</text>

            <text syncTime="1696.622" offset="6901490">If an identical employment discrimination action such as respondent's was brought against a private employer, the plaintiff would have six years in which to file, a period that is 12 times longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.231" offset="6960005">Now, I suggest that on its face, that distinction between public and private at least suggests that this statute is inconsistent with the policy underlying 1983, and it certainly warrants a careful investigation of the purpose of the Pennsylvania legislature in enacting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.196" offset="7051851">That investigation leaves no doubt as to the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.610" offset="7069510">From 1772 until &lt;nineteen seventy-eight&gt; [= 1978], Pennsylvania had a six-month statute of limitations for actions brought against a justice of the peace or a constable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.719" offset="7125934">The purpose of that abbreviated time period was expressly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.563" offset="7145265">Its purpose was, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.124" offset="7159580">"to insulate those officials from vexatious actions brought against them. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.338" offset="7184344">That statute of limitations was generalized in 1978 to become the residuary statute that applies to actions against government officials, and there is no dispute that the statute of limitations now before this Court is the extension of that 1772 statute, and it seems equally clear as to the purpose of the Pennsylvania legislature in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.068" offset="7299283">It was to extend to all public officials the same protection it had given for 200 years to justices of the peace and to constables, to protect all public officials from</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.667" offset="7353722">"vexatious actions that might be brought against them. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.279" offset="7368142">In Burnett v. Grattan last term, this Court made it clear that when a state, as here, abbreviates a statute of limitations to protect public officials from actions that might be brought against them, indeed, to restrict the remedies available, that that purpose is inconsistent with Section 1983, and the federal court should look elsewhere in state law to find a statute of limitations to borrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.020" offset="7499067">We do not understand the petitioners to quarrel with that basic proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.433" offset="7524772">They attempt instead to get around it, and they do that by suggesting other, presumably more acceptable state policies that might have prompted the Pennsylvania legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.333" offset="7584331">They cite in their brief the high turnover of public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.706" offset="7601885">That requires prompt initiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.338" offset="7612439">To safeguard the efficacy of factfinding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.320" offset="7624351">To avoid payment of two salaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.272" offset="7636158">To deter unlawful conduct by promptly exposing defalcations, and an argument we have just heard, another reason, to enable the state to budget more effectively and efficiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.200" offset="7683805">Although we do not concede that those policies would in any event justify this type of six-month statute, we need not debate the point here, because there are two other features of this statute which make it abundantly clear that those could not possibly have been the policies which motivated the Pennsylvania legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.117" offset="7783489">All of those suggested policies, safeguarding factfinding, the turnover of public officials, et cetera, are just as relevant to a lawsuit brought against government as an entity as they are when brought against a public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.719" offset="7849944">Indeed, I would suggest they are more relevant, because what they go to is the ability of government to function as government, the capacity of government to defend itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.596" offset="7893412">So, if anything, they should apply more to a suit against government as an entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.159" offset="7915668">And yet it is conceded in this case that if this very same suit were against a government entity, the filing time would be 12 times as long, six years instead of six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.889" offset="7974600">The remaining feature of this statute of limitations that is relevant here is that it is a residuary statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.126" offset="8011590">It applies only to those actions that the 1978 Pennsylvania legislature could not identify, those uncommon actions, and two conclusions emerge from this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.074" offset="8071358">If the purpose of the Pennsylvania legislature was the types of things that petitioner has suggested, to protect factfinding, better budgeting, high turnover of officials, why would the Pennsylvania legislature limit the six-month statute to those unknown and uncommon actions and allow a one, a two, and a four-year statute of limitations for the actions that are most commonly brought against public officials?</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.937" offset="8206777">Indeed, if this were a contract claim, which would involve all those relevant factors, two people claiming an office, budgeting, the Pennsylvania legislature expressly said, four-year statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.438" offset="8272814">The fact that we are dealing here with a residuary statute is significant in another, more basic respect, a respect, I suggest, that goes to the whole purpose of borrowing under Section 1988, and the reasons that this Court has understood as why Congress has asked for such borrowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.824" offset="8366333">The rationale for borrowing under 1988 reflects a deference to the judgment of state legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.458" offset="8400919">The federal courts in effect rely on the balance struck by a state legislature between the need to protect the assertion of valid claims on the one hand and the need to protect stale actions being brought on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.111" offset="8475525">The presumption is that the state legislature has weighed these interests, and after weighing them has come up with a cutoff point that reflects the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.068" offset="8519306">The petitioners rely very heavily on this, and they sprinkle their brief with such phrases as</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.912" offset="8550653">"the considered judgment of the state legislature. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.003" offset="8559012">"the state's wisdom in setting a limit. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.136" offset="8575626">"The legislature took into account the burdens borne by the party. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.929" offset="8594747">I suggest, Your Honors, that this reliance is totally misplaced when we are dealing with, as here, a residuary statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.297" offset="8636230">By definition there has not been this type of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.608" offset="8653471">There has been no weighing of competing interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.791" offset="8666218">There has been no consideration of the practicalities of litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2143.264" offset="8688057">Supposing you did have the kind of weighing that you say did not take place here, and the Pennsylvania legislature had hearings on 1983 litigation and concluded that for the most part they are quite a burden on the state and they really are not meritorious except in a minority of the cases, and deliberately passed a statute that said in all 1983 litigation the statute of limitation will be six months, whether the state is brought in state or federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2340.953" offset="9478836">Firstly, in the action against the public official, as distinguished from the action against the body, the public body, the public body does have other defenses it can raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.252" offset="9524080">There is sovereign immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2355.694" offset="9537768">And there is the Monell doctrine, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.984" offset="9550934">As to the preamble, which my opponent has also cited, that preamble was stricken, and there is no reason to believe that that was the purpose for enacting the six-month statutory period which was part of the limitation scheme adopted in the revision and codification of all the statutes of limitations and all the statutes applicable to judicial proceedings in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.035" offset="9663156">A clear reading of the language of the statute would support a reasonable explanation which I presented to this Court.</text>
