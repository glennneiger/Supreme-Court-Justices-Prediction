            <text syncTime="1550.250" offset="6340032">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I think this Court's recent decision in Davis versus Scherer makes clear that the issues in this case are not whether some pretermination procedures are to be required before termination of a discharged employee, but what procedures are to be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.420" offset="6400741">And I think in Note 10 of the case the Court says that we have to consider the factors in Matthews versus Eldridqe, and the first factor in Matthews versus Eldridge is the private interest involved, and this Court in Logan versus Zimmerman held that there is a substantial interest in the continued government employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.030" offset="6471167">We are also dealing with 16 million governmental employees, federal, state, and local, and when you are dealing with the dependents of such employees, you are possibly dealing with one-fifth to one-fourth of the population of the United States, so the right to continue governmental employment is clearly a substantial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.565" offset="6561341">The second factor is the risk of wrongful deprivation, and whether the use of additional procedures would lessen such risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.790" offset="6590181">First of all, under Ohio law, there is no procedure whatsoever to guarantee pretermination procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="2150.611" offset="8741521">First of all, the issue in Mathews versus Eldridge was not whether a hearing was required, but whether a prior evidentiary hearing was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.245" offset="8763986">There was no issue of pretermination procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.146" offset="8775585">Number Two, in Mathews versus Eldridge, the question was... basically the Court said it was a straightforward medical determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.632" offset="8801603">It was just whether or not the person... all those... it was by a medical doctor's medical reports, so basically it was a straightforward medical determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.076" offset="8835353">In this it was dealing with a fact standing, whether or not there were certain facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.899" offset="8854579">Also, in Donnelly's case, it wasn't just a medical determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.541" offset="8877149">There was a question of whether or not a prior employee, who also could not pass the eye test, was still employed, and that was a defense which was raised in front of the Civil Service Commission, that another employee who also could not pass the test, that plus the reasonableness, because he was a bus mechanic, he was not a bus driver, and the reasonableness of why a bus mechanic would have to pass the eye test was also raised, so those were the two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.346" offset="8960427">Also, in Arnett versus Kennedy, they talked about... I think the hearings was three months, the... proceedings was three months, but I think in the fact in this case it was nine months before the termination and the actual notice, and I think you have... first of all, you have a question... you have the great emotional damage to the employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2396.079" offset="9723307">I thought it was very unreasonable to also require the bus mechanic to also be a bus driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.053" offset="9739294">He was hired to be a bus mechanic and not to be a bus driver, so I argued basically the fact that, Number One, another employee who could not pass an eye exam was not terminated, and Number Two, that it was unreasonable to have bus mechanics be substitute bus drivers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2435.656" offset="9881609">And because when they needed substitute bus drivers they could not use him as a substitute bus driver.</text>

            <text syncTime="2441.600" offset="9905433">I would also like... as far as the delay issue, we are dealing here with nine months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.434" offset="9928734">During the nine months he said there was no right to unemployment, there was no right to welfare unless he sells his assets, like his house and his car, which, you know, if you are dealing with somebody who has geared his lifestyle to a certain level and all of a sudden gets a notice saying he is being terminated, you have a long, drawn out proceeding where the person not only loses wages, might not be able to get welfare, has to sell his house, has to probably sell his car, will probably lose his marriage and his children, basically the decisions of this Court say that a person should be given a full and fair hearing prior to final deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.437" offset="10076796">In this case Mr. Wyman says, well, it is temporary deprivation, ten or eleven months, if he is proven lawful, you get your back wages, but during those ten or eleven months, the person probably loses his house, he probably loses his car, his family, he loses his self-esteem, plus the right of the government, which is the third factor in Mathews versus Eldridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.290" offset="10144192">They have to decide when... they have to train somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.131" offset="10151506">What happens if the government says the termination is proved lawful?</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.525" offset="10169165">Then they have already somebody hired who may reach tenured status and this employee, so it is not just an issue of back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.198" offset="10199781">The final deprivation when a person loses his house, loses his car, loses all his assets, and probably loses his family, is already taken prior to the administrative procedure being over, and this Court has said that the purposes of the due process is before final deprivation, so back pay, a person has to give up his house, has to give up his car, probably loses his family, loses his self-esteem, plus he is in limbo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.972" offset="10282954">He doesn't know whether or not he should try to get other employment, and also the reasons for his termination, like in Donnelly's, or, excuse me, Loudermill, he was terminated for dishonesty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.706" offset="10313883">Every time he filed another application, what is your last employment, Cleveland Board of Education, was terminated for dishonesty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.101" offset="10335408">So how do you expect somebody to get another job?</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.642" offset="10345648">And so here you are dealing with a lengthy period where actually the effects, the deprivation is final.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.617" offset="10377518">He loses his house, he loses his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.357" offset="10384414">There is definitely final deprivation before you get... prior to resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.541" offset="10401237">So it is not just a temporary termination and back wages.</text>

            <text syncTime="2942.460" offset="11908920">Also, I think there is a big point here about the promptness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.282" offset="11920205">I think that the Court of Appeals stated that Mr. Loudermill had a hearing two and a half months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.405" offset="11940685">However, the decision was not made until nine months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.187" offset="11951761">And I think you can't just say give a hearing and then allow an unreasonable time for resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.751" offset="11974017">This Court has stated you are not only entitled to a prompt hearing, but you are also entitled to a prompt disposition, and I think just the fact that a person was given a hearing in two and a half months when the whole procedure took ten months, I think, is very unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.117" offset="12023545">Also, the Court of Appeals mentioned the procedure used of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.722" offset="12041936">I think that is a very extraordinary remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.784" offset="12054161">It is discretionary whether or not the Court would grant it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.515" offset="12065132">You don't know how many months it would be, especially when you are dealing with somebody who doesn't have counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.717" offset="12081851">You are dealing with the government on one hand, the awesome power of the government against the individual, who a lot of time isn't represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.152" offset="12107660">Also, this Court in Mennonite Board of Missions versus Adams stated that the fact that an individual can protect his rights still doesn't relieve the government of its responsibility to guarantee due process rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.149" offset="12155621">Also, the Sixth Circuit held that there was no liberty interest violated because the grounds for Mr. Loudermill's and Donnelly's terminations weren't published, and it is our position with the Court that it was communicated to the employers, that when Mr. Loudermill filed employment applications prior to... this is his past employer, Cleveland Board of Education, they said, well, he was terminated for dishonesty, and was unable to get any future employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.447" offset="12264812">So there was communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.668" offset="12273694">This Court in Paul versus Davis stated that the constitutional violation is defamation in... deprivation of a governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.096" offset="12315385">Here he was terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.288" offset="12320192">He had a right to continued employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.999" offset="12331059">Therefore he had a governmental interest, and he was terminated in there, so that the procedures, constitutional requirements would be provided by the publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.685" offset="12365749">It doesn't have to be "publicized", but there was publication because other employees, employers, or potential employers were notified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.360" offset="12400440">I would like to say that in Gaus versus Lopez, where there was suspension of high school students, they said that there would be a liberty interest, because future employment opportunities would be involved, and in their case it wasn't "published", but yet this Court found a violation of a liberty interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.171" offset="12467732">I would like to point out to this Court in Parrott versus Taylor you said that there are only two instances where no pretermination procedures would be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.386" offset="12500541">One is where there is implausibility of pretermination procedures, which is certainly not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.141" offset="12519558">And Number Two, where there is necessity for quick action, and I think if there is an emergency situation, which we deny, because there was no prior violations or disciplinary procedures, that a suspension could be made with the opportunity to respond to the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.700" offset="12585805">So therefore the two requirements in Parrott versus Taylor to dispose of any pretermination procedures will not be applicable herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.105" offset="12611405">The main thing that we need... basically is that we need clarity, that there has to be some... that public employers have to know what exactly the procedures are before they can terminate somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.321" offset="12656336">As you know, the police know that they have to have probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.093" offset="12667412">They have to know that they give the Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.304" offset="12676293">And so we need clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.896" offset="12682667">I would also like to say that you can't really have due process on a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.429" offset="12696773">Mr. Wyman says, well, the greater the risk, the more the need for pretermination procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.661" offset="12713701">You leave it up to the employer to determine whether or not there are risks involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.323" offset="12728329">There is no statutory right to grant pretermination procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.846" offset="12742435">Well, this case there is a big risk so we have hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.316" offset="12748287">This case we won't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.297" offset="12752257">I think you need a statutory right that says you are going to give them notice, you are going to give them an opportunity to present witnesses, and have a decision by an impartial decision-maker, and also that you need a prompt procedure, it has to be held within 30 days, so not only the government can make its determination of whether or not they are going to have to hire somebody, but also the employer can get on with the rest of his life.</text>

            <text syncTime="3237.862" offset="13090491">We have one issue before this Court, and that is due process, and what is fundamentally fair to the employees involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.708" offset="13121838">It must be kept in mind, and I would urge this Court to keep in mind the fact that the due process rights impact not only upon the governmental entity in this case but also upon those whom we serve, which are the pupils.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.348" offset="13180456">We are in the business of education, as I said before, and there are treatises out that consider us to be a nation at risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.493" offset="13205012">It is important for us to get on with the business of education, not with establishing elaborate routines and procedures for our employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.829" offset="13250360">That is taken care of under Ohio Revised Code 124.34.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.382" offset="13264571">It provides for due process hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.554" offset="13281289">They are de novo hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.725" offset="13289962">They are hearings that are by an objective board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.857" offset="13302501">We feel they are appropriate underneath the Ohio Revised Code and the due process standards of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.703" offset="13333847">We respectfully request this Court to affirm the District Court's decisions of the dismissal, to reverse the Sixth Circuit in regards to the pretermination issue, to find that Ohio Revised Code Section 124.34 is in fact constitutional and adequately protects the rights of those that are affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.299" offset="13436247">The process that the respondents were due was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.961" offset="13454847">Thank you.</text>
