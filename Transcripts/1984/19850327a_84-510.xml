            <text syncTime="43.443" offset="305570">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="46.129" offset="316227">The central question in this case is whether under Section 2 of the Sherman Act a firm with monopoly power has a duty to cooperate with a smaller rival by participating in a horizontal arrangement for joint marketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.405" offset="377354">The question in the circumstances of this case is shaped by two additional material facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.625" offset="402223">First, the firm with monopoly power here, Aspen Ski Company, was not vertically integrated, but rather operated at only one level of the skiing industry, and therefore cases such as Terminal Railroad, Kodak, and Otter Tail are readily distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.272" offset="476828">This case involves no vertical element.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.324" offset="489054">Secondly, the conduct at issue here, Ski Company's refusal to cooperate with Aspen Highlands, was decided on and carried out by Ski Company independently and not as part of any group, contract, combination, or conspiracy, and thus, under the distinction between independent action and concerted action reaffirmed by this Court last term in Monsanto and in Copperweld, what we have here is clearly independent conduct, not concerted conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.260" offset="612770">In these circumstances, we submit the answer to the question presented is no, that no firm, not even one with monopoly power, has a duty under the antitrust laws to engage in horizontal joint marketing arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.789" offset="674941">Although voluntary horizontal arrangements between competitors sometimes have pro-competitive aspects and are consistent with the goals of the antitrust laws and therefore pass muster under Section 1's rule of reason, mandatory horizontal arrangements imposed by law and enforced and administered by courts have never had any place in the jurisprudence of antitrust.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard Melvyn Cooper</label>
            <text syncTime="191.473" offset="897609">--It does indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.177" offset="920492">In the 95 years since the enactment of the Sherman Act, this Court has never held or suggested that any duty of horizontal cooperation exists or should exist, and until the decision by the Tenth Circuit below no Court of Appeals in the 95 years of the statute had ever so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.157" offset="996352">Thus, the decision below is unprecedented, and we submit is unwarranted on the facts of this case and is indeed directly contrary to the central goals of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.248" offset="1048701">The principal facts are relatively straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.866" offset="1063225">The product market involved here is downhill skiing services.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.837" offset="1083078">The jury found two geographic markets, one embracing all of North America and including all of the firms that cater to destination skiers those who travel a substantial distance to a ski area, generally by airplane, at least in part, and who spend a substantial amount of time, generally at least a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.668" offset="1166461">The jury also found a sub-market consisting of the Aspen area in which the Petitioner and the Respondent conduct their businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.523" offset="1205854">For a number of years, each of the two firms has offered single day lift tickets and a variety of multi-day lift tickets designed to meet the varying needs of different skiers.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.516" offset="1253814">And if you examine the exhibits, Exhibit 15 and 47 that show the history of the ticket offerings and prices of the two firms, you will see that there has been considerable experimentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.091" offset="1308149">The specific kinds of tickets offered have varied from year to year and the pricing interrelationships among the tickets have varied from year to year.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.880" offset="1347228">The court below placed some reliance on the fact that shortly before trial Ski Company announced a prospective increase in its daily lift ticket price from $18 to $22 per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.622" offset="1402190">That was a 22 percent increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.308" offset="1408982">That's not the largest one-year increase shown in the record of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.143" offset="1428312">From 1977-'78 to '78-'79, Highlands increased its ticket price 25 percent in one swoop.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.401" offset="1469377">Also, the relationship between the single day lift ticket and multi-day lift tickets in terms of price varied from year to year.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.338" offset="1501142">Ski Company's during '78-'79, '79-'80 and prospectively for '81-'82 was in the 12.5 to 13.5 percent range.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.062" offset="1543983">Highlands during these years was approximately a 35 percent discount.</text>

            <text syncTime="1220.004" offset="5011790">First, it is consistent with the goal of achieving economic efficiency and consumer welfare, and the duty to cooperate is contrary to that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.529" offset="5053899">A duty to cooperate mandated by law is in essence a subsidy that transfers resources and rewards from the more efficient firm that seeks to compete to the less efficient firm that is dependent on cooperation, and it thereby injures the efficient use of resources by the more efficient firm, with consequent injury to long-term consumer interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.827" offset="5155045">In addition, a duty to cooperate would discourage risk-taking, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.535" offset="5193916">If a firm that engages in risk-taking, for example, has to share with its rivals the benefits of successful entrepreneurial activity, but must itself absorb on its own the costs of unsuccessful entrepreneurial activity, then the law discourages such activity, to the detriment of consumers, of productivity, and of the competitiveness of American firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.750" offset="5294748">Second, a duty to cooperate is contrary to the antitrust goal of economic freedom, of autonomous decisionmaking by individual economic units.</text>

            <text syncTime="1550.170" offset="6332436">With all the other mountains in that area, it seems absurd to have a market that narrow.</text>

            <text syncTime="1567.881" offset="6403281">And finally, the jury found that Petitioner willfully used its monopoly power to exclude the Respondent from the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.737" offset="6438703">Now, I take it, in response to a question from one of the other Justices, you said your position basically is that those findings were contrary to the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.186" offset="6532534">In substance the task is much easier, because the only evidence, we submit, that could possibly support the jury verdict that isn't de minimus is the evidence of failure to cooperate in various ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.243" offset="6576734">And we submit that there is no duty under Section 2 as a matter of law why that evidence should even go to the jury, but even taking that evidence as established fact, it doesn't amount to an antitrust violation; that there is no duty to accept your competitor's coupons for entry into your own facilities; that there's no duty to have a joint ticket with your competitor; and that there's no duty to sell your tickets to your competitors so that he can package them with his own tickets to get tag-along purchases of his own tickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.363" offset="6697210">And if the Court launches on a new duty to cooperate, if it establishes that in antitrust law, we submit the consequences would be very deleterious.</text>

            <text syncTime="1915.459" offset="7793622">The theory of monopolization is I think as this Court has stated it in Grinnell, and that is that it condemns conduct which maintains or extends a monopolist's power, but it does not condemn conduct which is the result of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.651" offset="7858405">That in a nutshell is the rule that this case was tried under.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.122" offset="7876273">And as a matter of fact, that rule was submitted as the instruction in this case by trial counsel for Petitioner, and trial counsel for Petitioner further set forth in the instructions that were proposed to this trial judge that competitors do not have a duty to cooperate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.534" offset="7953909">He went on to say that they may refuse to deal, provided they have a valid business justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.270" offset="7980867">That's the basis, that's the rule of law, that this case was tried under, and that's been the law in this country since 1927, when this Court decided Eastman Kodak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.126" offset="8016290">And in that rule essentially we set up a standard for monopolists which subjects their refusal to deal to scrutiny, and that particular rule makes some economic sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.119" offset="8068221">Whereas in a competitive market firms in those situations are disciplined by the market if they refuse to deal... after all, consumers can turn to other suppliers of the product... not so in the situation where a firm has monopoly power, and especially in a market such as this, where there are only two firms, one with over 80 percent of the market and the other with the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.318" offset="8161008">A refusal to deal in that circumstance is not disciplined automatically as it is in a competitive market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.122" offset="8188280">Thus the rule as set forth in the jury instructions which the trial judge accepted from the Petitioner essentially sets forth how this case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.696" offset="8238539">And as it was tried, both sides put on evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.148" offset="8252332">Trial counsel for Petitioner put on numerous business justifications to try to show that its conduct was justified, including its so-called free rider argument that it's resurrected on appeal and still belabored in the Petitioner's briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2393.167" offset="9704427">And this case involved more than just dropping out of a four-area arrangement that had existed for 16 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2900.896" offset="11735290">How could they possibly have free rider problems with Highlands, but not have them with tour operators?</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.800" offset="11758905">Highlands wanted to do the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.818" offset="11767055">How could they possibly have free rider problems with coupons when they didn't have free rider problems in Summit County with coupons?</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.238" offset="11796730">So we think that that contrary conduct in similar situations exposes those refusals to deal as ones that create no economic detriment to the incentives to invest in this particular company, as hypothetically surmised by Mr. Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.568" offset="11878023">And we think also that it reveals that it was targeted conduct, trying to prevent Highlands from competing with its package.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.824" offset="11911042">Let me just mention the competitive effect and what the evidence was on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.978" offset="11939672">Highlands invested in and helped develop this four-area joint venture, this four-area ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.334" offset="11969139">It had been in existence since 1962, for about 16 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.053" offset="11987947">And in 1973 Highlands brought an innovation, creating Aspen Reservations, Inc., as we discuss in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.158" offset="12020339">And with that innovation came another innovation, which was the around the neck format, and the around the neck format is really what made this venture take off, which made this distribution system superior to the daily lift tickets, because now, instead of having to go back to the ticket window and stand in line every day, they could go right into the lift and go up the mountain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.424" offset="12109468">They could choose any one of the four areas on any given day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.459" offset="12121589">That particular distribution system, the four-area ticket, became the state of the art way of gaining access in multi-mountain resorts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.315" offset="12157011">It coupled convenience with variety, two things that skiers when they came to such resorts wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.901" offset="12183343">In every other market that Ski Company operated in, it participated in these arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.872" offset="12207271">In Aspen, after it kicked Highlands out of the four-area ticket, it didn't return to just offering daily tickets; it returned to a very similar type system which combined convenience with variety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.880" offset="12259307">In short, the strong demand for this ticket, this type of an arrangement, made access to it crucial for a competitor such as Highlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.655" offset="12298386">And it's not a situation where we are, if you will, on the coattails of Ski Company's enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.725" offset="12322627">This was partially our enterprise as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.275" offset="12332867">This enterprise was one that we invested in with advertising dollars and that we helped out with some of our innovative ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.532" offset="12373827">The refusal then of Ski Company to allow us to market our own substitute product by refusing to sell tickets to us or accept coupons had two fundamental adverse impacts on the competitive process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.726" offset="12438611">In the short run, consumers were deprived of a product that they wanted, that they clearly had demanded, that they had voted on clearly and shown to be the preferred type of ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.636" offset="12490334">And in the long run Highlands was slowly being driven from the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.354" offset="12509142">The evidence showed... and we ask you to look at Exhibit 97, which shows that Highlands was falling in terms of its skier visits, despite the fact that the evidence showed that it was a quality mountain, a quality product, and was efficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.049" offset="12575911">In conclusion, let me just state that an affirmance in this case will not create a duty to cooperate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.071" offset="12607989">As I have argued and pointed out, instead well-established Section 2 precedent will be continued which permits refusals to deal by monopolists provided that they are supported by efficiencies or other business justifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.332" offset="12685103">In this case you have a jury verdict, where quite clearly there was strong evidence that there were no efficiency or other justifications to support these targeted refusals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.390" offset="12733272">By contrast, a reversal of this case, in light of the record below, will result in a freeing of a monopolist to completely refuse to deal without any justification, even though there's a demonstrable showing of damage to the competitive process, even though innovation will be retarded, even though there will only be one competitor in the market potentially, that is Aspen Ski Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.126" offset="12844241">And we think that the antitrust laws mean more than just a call for trader sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.430" offset="12869423">There are other interests that must be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.799" offset="12878931">Thank you.</text>
