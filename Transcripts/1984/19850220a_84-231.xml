            <text syncTime="12.324" offset="179334">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.542" offset="192186">Appellant Alvin Hooper has been permanently denied a veterans property tax exemption which is given to other similarly situated veterans in New Mexico solely because he did not establish residence in that state prior to May 8, 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.452" offset="255925">The issue in this case is whether that denial by the Appellee Assessor denies his constitutional rights of state citizenship, equal protection, and his fundamental right of interstate migration.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.193" offset="306811">The Court of Appeals from New Mexico held that the denial by the Assessor did not violate those rights and the Supreme Court of New Mexico refused to review that decision and the case is now before this Court on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.234" offset="354981">The facts of the case can be briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.805" offset="369296">New Mexico Constitution authorizes a veteran's property tax exemption in the amount of $2,000 and that exemption is implemented through New Mexico Statute 737-5, which is the statute involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.897" offset="429691">In order to quality for the exemption, the statute requires that the Claimant actually be a veteran.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.551" offset="456232">Secondly, that the veteran be a bona fide resident at the time of claiming the exemption, and, thirdly, that the veteran had served on active duty for 90 days during a period of armed conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.907" offset="497714">There is no question about Appellant Hooper meeting those qualifications and those are not an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.513" offset="524150">However, this statute goes on to add another durational type residential requirement which requires that a Vietnam-era veteran claiming the exemption must have been a resident of the state prior to May 8, 1976 in order to qualify for the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.106" offset="582455">And, it is the validity of this additional residency requirement that is in issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.759" offset="605130">The Appellants believe this case is controlled by Zobel v. Williams and under that case the residency requirement is invalid.</text>

            <label>Justice White</label>
            <text syncTime="127.263" offset="639089">I take it the law doesn't require that the person be a resident of New Mexico at some point during his service.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alvin D. Hooper</label>
            <text syncTime="136.305" offset="675242">No, Your Honor, and that is one of the main reasons I contend this statute has no the residency requirement has not rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.792" offset="705231">There is no coincidence of military service and residence required.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.161" offset="718710">Like Zobel, this case involves permanent and retrospective classifications of residents in which the newer arriving residents are never able to achieve equality with the earlier arriving residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.836" offset="773463">Now, only two alleged purposes have been set forth by the state and by the Assessor which were accepted by the Court below as purposes for this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.894" offset="825603">One of those purposes is to express gratitude and to reward New Mexico's veterans and to ease their return to civilian life at the end of their military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.786" offset="873250">However, this statute has a problem in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.773" offset="889133">If New Mexico's intent was to reward veterans who were residents at the time the exemption was given, then they have failed to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.526" offset="920166">The statute is under-inclusive because it did not include bona fide resident veterans such as Appellant and all other residents who had moved to the state since May 8, 1976.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.805" offset="4709280">No, Your Honor, I would not, because I was not a resident at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.774" offset="4729133">And, if New Mexico had given a bonus during the war to those who were residents at that time, I would have no claim to that and that is not what I am claiming at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.780" offset="4761211">I am claiming that here they are giving an on-going, year-after-year exemption based solely on an arbitrary date of residency which is not tied to anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.636" offset="4796633">I believe that classifying similarly situated veterans into permanent classes and this is a permanent classification people who came after 1976 are forever barred from achieving equality with those who came before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.729" offset="4852953">I believe that that kind of classification creates a seniority system of state citizens in which the earlier arriving residents are more worthy or more equal in a sense than those who arrived later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.286" offset="4907183">I believe this Court's decisions have clearly indicated that those kinds of seniority systems based on duration of residency or length of residency are invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.177" offset="4950756">And by the same rationale, this residency requirement is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.765" offset="4973117">In fact, it is hard to separate date of residency from length of residency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.300" offset="4991298">They are exactly the same thing unless there has been some discontinuity in the residency at some place along the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.806" offset="5017316">This is essentially the same as In 1983 when New Mexico enacted this statute, they said to their veterans, in order to get this benefit you must have lived in New Mexico for the last seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.196" offset="5070815">That is essentially what it boils down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.065" offset="5078338">And, that, to me, is clearly not permissible in view of this Court's many holdings regarding durational residency requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.588" offset="5120447">I believe the 1982 Zobel v. Williams case really controls this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.996" offset="5162034">The Court below really dismissed that case with a wave of a hand and simply said that for two reasons that that involved a tax legislation this involves tax legislation where Zobel did not and, secondly, that for some reason it was not applicable to this case because Zobel apportioned a benefit rather than denying the entire benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.461" offset="5263912">To me, it would appear much worse to deny the benefit entirely than it would be to apportion it based on residency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.800" offset="5293273">I believe the residency requirement here is very analogous to that in Zobel because that involved a retrospective feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.589" offset="5332457">It also involved permanent classifications or distinctions between citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.108" offset="5350534">The Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment equates state citizenship with simply residency and that clause does not provide for and does not permit degrees of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.618" offset="5404555">And, that is exactly what is happening here in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.919" offset="5417721">They are creating degrees of citizenship in which those who arrived after May 8, 1976 have a second class citizenship status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.960" offset="5457949">As I indicated, this residency requirement is essentially the same as a durational residency requirement in that it divides residents into those who came at an earlier time and those who came after May 8, 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.304" offset="5527330">The waiting period for equality under this statute for a veteran who came after May 8, 1976 is forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.410" offset="5551677">One could live in New Mexico forever, even though he established residency on May 9, 1976 and he never would get this benefit, whereas, a veteran living in that state for one day at any time prior to that date would be provided the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.185" offset="5618759">Even if this Court should agree that this residency requirement passes the rational basis test, I believe it should go further and subject it to strict scrutiny because of its impact on the fundamental right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.279" offset="5679154">The Court has indicated that the fundamental right to travel prohibits a state from putting newer residents at a disadvantage or otherwise treating them differently from earlier residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.820" offset="5721368">Under that reasoning, it does not appear permissible for New Mexico to penalize those who exercise their fundamental right to migrate to that state after May 8, 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.960" offset="5769956">The Court in the Shapiro case indicated that any classification which penalizes that right must be subjected to strict scrutiny and will not survive unless it is found necessary to promote a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.785" offset="5821156">New Mexico clearly has not shown any compelling interest for this classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.624" offset="5848532">In fact, there isn't even a rational basis for it much less a compelling interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.510" offset="5868072">The Court below seemed to feel that the only kind of right that... the denial of which would create an impact on the fundamental right to travel were those rights which would deter migration if they, in fact, were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.323" offset="5947379">This Court has clearly indicated that actual deterrent is not required in order to create an impact on the fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.112" offset="5986563">And, I would point out, this right here is actually very synonymous to the right involved in the Zobel case and the concurring members of this Court clearly believed that that was sufficient impact to create an invalid... That created an invalid impact on the fundamental right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.746" offset="6089068">Furthermore, this tax exemption is authorized in the New Mexico Constitution and certainly for New Mexico residents it is considered a very important benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.804" offset="6137237">The fact that the residency requirement itself... I mean the tax exemption statute itself serves generally legitimate purposes is not adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.266" offset="6211112">The residency requirement itself must satisfy the legitimate purpose and there is no evidence whatsoever of any legitimate purpose here associated with this statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="1546.599" offset="6316437">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.217" offset="6330961">The issue in this case is whether New Mexico, in awarding a modest benefit for service during the Vietnam War, may impose a condition of bona fide residency at the time of the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.708" offset="6388849">In our view, it clearly may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.893" offset="6397626">Now, it is important to understand just how the statute works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.130" offset="6414553">In giving a benefit for service during the Vietnam War, New Mexico has created two classes based upon residency at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.836" offset="6453423">The first class and one that admittedly is not mathematically exact, consists mainly of persons leaving New Mexico for the war and persons coming back and settling in New Mexico within a year after the war's end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.496" offset="6516013">That class New Mexico regards as its citizens at the time of the war and they get a modest reduction in their property valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.868" offset="6553525">The second class consists of people who left from other states, came back and settled in other states, and had no ties whatsoever to New Mexico at any time during the Vietnam War.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.544" offset="6612248">That group may have gotten bonuses and other benefits from their home states at the time of the war but they do not qualify for the New Mexico benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.585" offset="6652372">Now, Appellant's argument depends essentially on compressing two separate time periods into one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.191" offset="6686854">Looked at closely, his claim to the New Mexico benefit says, first, that 20 or so years ago he served during the Vietnam War.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.647" offset="6732620">Then he says four years ago he came to New Mexico and became a resident and is now a resident of New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.937" offset="6769819">Thus, he says, he is both a soldier and a resident indistinguishable from other soldiers and residents who get the benefit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2045.485" offset="8311983">What they did in 1981 and then again in... by adding a year in 1983 was to expand that class of beneficiaries so they didn't cut out people who came back and settled during the time of the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.543" offset="8360258">I think that makes the statute better rather than worse from a constitutional standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.946" offset="8377812">Appellant makes two attacks on the means used by New Mexico to serve its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.950" offset="8409890">First he says that the date of May 7, 1976, described by the Court of Appeals as one year after the final U.S. troop withdrawal, is, in fact... I think that is phrased correctly... pulled out of thin air and bears no relation to the Vietnam War at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.062" offset="8478331">This argument is simply incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.180" offset="8490766">In Title 38, Section 101 of the U.S. Code, Congress has specifically provided in defining those eligible for federal veterans' benefits that the Vietnam era ended on May 7, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.039" offset="8554191">That date is precisely the date that New Mexico chose in 1981 when it first enlarged the statute before it added on another year's grace period in 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.164" offset="8598703">Now, Appellant's other argument is even if New Mexico could have declared a benefit for all its resident veterans on May 7, 1976 it could not grant a retroactive benefit to exactly the same class in 1981 or 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.495" offset="8679997">Now, in my view, this is really Appellant's main argument just stated another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.398" offset="8699641">If there was a rational basis for awarding New Mexico soldiers a benefit on May 7, 1976 because they had particular ties to New Mexico at the time of the war, which is what we submit, that basis does not disappear simply because the war is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.943" offset="8773828">For example, if New Mexico had granted a benefit to its veterans on May 7, 1976 on the basis of those special ties, Appellant clearly would not have been able to claim the same benefit simply by showing up five years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.422" offset="8839761">Yet, the basis of the benefit and Appellant's lack of the necessary ties is exactly the same in 1981 and, in fact, it is exactly the same right now.</text>

            <text syncTime="2574.412" offset="10427693">--Well, I don't regard it as the same though for a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.797" offset="10441277">In the first place, that is true of any statute that draws a line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.399" offset="10455696">You look at someone just on one side and someone just on the other and you say that, boy, they look a lot alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.386" offset="10475654">So, I don't think there is anything unique about this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.172" offset="10486730">In the Zobel situation though the purpose was simply to reward citizens generally for the generalized notion that they had been citizens through a period of time doing what is normally expected of citizens, nothing unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.729" offset="10545035">I think the Court correctly said in Zobel that purpose is impermissible, it opens up an endless amount of doors that could lead to real second-class citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.953" offset="10589861">But here I think they are just simply saying this is the line we are drawing for the end of a particular event that we are rewarding by giving special help for and I think it is a completely different kind of line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.945" offset="10637822">Now, I would like to spend just a few minutes on the question of right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.283" offset="10667183">Appellant has said that even if the statute if perfectly rational, it still must be struck down because it burdens the right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.222" offset="10702919">I think the argument is wrong for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.008" offset="10714099">First of all, this case really doesn't involve the right to travel in the usual sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.912" offset="10737714">As I have said, what this case is really about is a bona fide residency requirement at the time of the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.232" offset="10766971">In cases involving the question of residency at the time of a particular event as opposed to over a length of time, I think the proper focus should be on barriers to residency at the time of the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.091" offset="10826426">New Mexico did not put up any barriers to Appellant coming to New Mexico during the time of the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.931" offset="10857773">This is not a situation, for example, where Appellant is saying I was there on May 1, 1976, but there was a requirement that I had to have been there six months before May 6, 1976 and, therefore, I haven't gotten the bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.857" offset="10921512">What he is simply saying is I came later and, therefore, didn't get into the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.845" offset="10941469">I think that is a very different kind of inquiry from the right-to-travel inquiry than the Court is normally engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.831" offset="10969368">But, even if you look at the situation in 1981 when Appellant came or if you look at it now, I still think that there isn't any real burden on the right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.389" offset="11015657">This is not a case, for example, where the state has deliberately sought to keep out any particular residents or new residents generally, therefore, for example, it is completely different from Shapiro where there was an impermissible purpose very obvious from the statute to keep indigents out of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.886" offset="11093606">Nor does it present any concern about a state trying to wall itself off from national concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.057" offset="11126312">To the contrary actually, New Mexico is rewarding a national service in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.877" offset="11149613">There is also no intolerable penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.979" offset="11161943">Again, this is not a case where the state is depriving new residents of welfare benefits or medical care or something of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.370" offset="11199559">Even if those... Even if denial of those benefits is intended to keep people from traveling, I think the Court has recognized that it will make people realistically think twice, some class of people, and if they come anyway may cause a serious hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.630" offset="11260581">But, we are talking essentially here about a tax exemption of $100 or so to someone who has to be a property owner in the first place and I don't think it in any way amounts to that sort of penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.937" offset="11309796">So, our position in short is that the statute does not infringe the right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.941" offset="11337799">New Mexico has made a rational decision to confer a special benefit on those veterans who were its residents at the time of the war and it has defined that class not in a mathematically precise manner but in a perfectly rational manner and equal protection requires nothing more.</text>
