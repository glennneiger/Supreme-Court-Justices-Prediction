            <text syncTime="87.689" offset="489455">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in a recent swearing in ceremony, in several, as a matter of fact, the New Hampshire Supreme Court has admonished new admittees that in the court's view New Hampshire lawyers should not just be merchants of law, but instead should be servants of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.971" offset="586630">The residency requirement involved in this case is one of the ways the New Hampshire court has chosen to reinforce the court's aspirations for New Hampshire lawyers as part of a system for administering justice in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.247" offset="639711">The New Hampshire court has concluded that requiring residency at the time of admission assists in assuring that New Hampshire lawyers will be available to perform obligations that the court has imposed on lawyers in the course of defining the nature and characteristics of the proper practice of law in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.644" offset="721318">At stake in this case, we submit, is whether the New Hampshire court can continue to reinforce its aspirations for New Hampshire lawyers through use of a simple residency requirement that New Hampshire lawyers be residents of New Hampshire at the time they take the oath of admission.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.561" offset="833017">The New Hampshire Supreme Court requires residency at the time of administering the oath, and in order to become a resident, one has to undertake to the court that one has become a resident with the indefinite intention of remaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.010" offset="930820">Yes, and that, of course... therein lies one of the great challenges of our brethren in this case, because they seem to say that because New Hampshire does not revoke licenses if someone moves away, that somehow there is something wrong with this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.638" offset="1001246">If I may just express to the Court what the New Hampshire court's reasons are for that requirement, then I would like to address why the revocation argument doesn't hold any water.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.429" offset="1044400">I think the facts bearing on the New Hampshire Supreme Court's reasons are extremely important.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.016" offset="1070836">We have no need to guess in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.285" offset="1079927">Those reasons are embodied in an affidavit of New Hampshire Chief Justice King.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.837" offset="1098108">Those reasons appear at the Joint Appendix on Page 32, and the case comes here on summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.974" offset="1122663">There are no findings contrary to Justice King's affidavit, and on this record I don't think there is any room to doubt that Justice King accurately states what the New Hampshire court is doing with the residency requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.615" offset="1169161">And what it is doing is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.733" offset="1177625">As the affidavit recites, the New Hampshire court regards residency as establishing New Hampshire as the principal place of physical residence for the indefinite future.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.875" offset="1218271">So residency at the time of admission is the New Hampshire court's chosen proxy for promoting sustained physical presence in the New Hampshire community.</text>

            <text syncTime="725.532" offset="3040887">The other apparent purpose, at least the purpose that appears to me, is to argue that the New Hampshire residence requirement fails to meet this close tailoring test of standard privileges and immunities analysis, and I would just like to observe that it is an odd argument that the rule would have to be more restrictive in order to meet the close tailoring test, that is, more restrictive by requiring people to remain New Hampshire residents to infinity in order to keep their license.</text>

            <text syncTime="784.687" offset="3277451">--Yes, it does, and I would like to demonstrate to you why in practice it supports the justifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.541" offset="3300857">First of all, we are not talking about a mere scintilla of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.343" offset="3312142">If people are going to deal in good faith with the New Hampshire Supreme Court, which I sincerely hope they would do if they are asking to be admitted to the bar, they are asked to express their intention to become residents in the indefinite future.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.634" offset="3357282">Secondly, the present requirement, and I think this is important to grasp, does the job of promoting sustained physical presence without further restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.157" offset="3391345">Even the beyond the record figures cited in the Vermont bar amicus brief show that almost 90 percent of New Hampshire lawyers remain in the state, and so the present requirement seems to be a practical success to accomplish these objectives that the New Hampshire Supreme Court wants to accomplish without additional restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.719" offset="3469608">The statistics offered by Mrs. Piper and the Vermont bar brief don't even really show that the 13.6 percent number they claim are out-of-state lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.926" offset="3510464">The problem with their statistics is that they rely on business mailing addresses, not residence addresses, and the statistics sweep in lawyers who may be away temporarily on government service.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.948" offset="3550483">For example, the numbers show that 24 New Hampshire lawyers had business addresses in the District of Columbia, the second highest number of supposed absentees.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.006" offset="3594787">Virginia had 18, the fourth highest.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.625" offset="3605236">So, we are talking about lawyers who may leave New Hampshire temporarily to come down here on government service, and then may go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.112" offset="3631149">They are swept into these statistics, and the statistics also sweep in lawyer who may practice in neighboring states but may retain New Hampshire residence, and so they are still available to participate in these additional activities that the court requires of New Hampshire lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.371" offset="3688201">And there again, we see those statistics presented, and these are at Joint Appendix Page 30: Massachusetts, 96; Main, 19; Vermont, 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.977" offset="3726653">So, what we see is a rule which bites at the time of admission of the oath, and as a practical matter, that is all that's all it needs to do, because as Judge Campbell of the Court of Appeals noted, the New Hampshire court could reasonably conclude that not many New Hampshire lawyers will both pull up stakes and continue practice in New Hampshire, and the bureaucracy required to keep track of their comings and goings would not be worth the effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.544" offset="3832919">And I suggest to you that that is exactly what the New Hampshire court has concluded, because their present rule does work, and it does work as a reasonable proxy for sustained physical presence in the state in order to carry out these extensive additional duties that the New Hampshire court expects of members of the New Hampshire bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.440" offset="3908465">If I can turn now to the legal points that we are talking about, the first legal point that we made is that the New Hampshire court's residency requirements shouldn't be subject to federal judicial scrutiny under the privileges and immunities clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.366" offset="3968234">At the outset, I would like to make it clear that we are not contending that state court regulations of the bar are immune from all constitutional scrutiny by federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.823" offset="4006059">That is simply not the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.023" offset="4010865">It is not our argument, and we don't make it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.606" offset="4021210">What we do argue, as the Court recently pointed out in United Building and Construction Trades, is that there is a threshold issue to be determined in every case involving the privileges and immunities clause, whether the interest at stake is fundamental to the promotion of interstate harmony.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.818" offset="4082023">And in this case, the question is whether state court control over the legal profession involves regulation of an interest fundamental to the promotion of a state--</text>

            <text syncTime="1888.601" offset="7693190">The precise language this Court has used in developing the test has varied slightly from case to case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1906.478" offset="7764661">And I think Camden is also a significant case because in that... again in that case the city had some fairly strong claims to be exempt from the clause's coverage altogether, insofar as the measure only applied to public employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.755" offset="7829758">Nevertheless, this Court held that the clause applied, and I think that shows an intention to give Article 4 a broad reading, which we believe is consonant with the values that are protected by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.415" offset="7880436">What I would like to do in the time allotted is respond to New Hampshire's contentions that it should have... in effect, the rule should be examined under a lesser standard of review or no standard at all, and then to look at the New Hampshire justifications in the context of the standard that this Court has set forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2355.129" offset="9559274">But again, we think that the claim that because most people live in New Hampshire, the residency requirement has been effective is fallacious, because although I may be prejudiced, we believe that the reason most people live in New Hampshire, most attorneys, is not because of the residency requirement, but because New Hampshire is a nice state to live in, and because if you happen to practice in New Hampshire, it is a convenient state to live in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.279" offset="9671809">So, we think residency requirement or no residency requirement, the likelihood is that the majority of New Hampshire practitioners are going to continue to live in New Hampshire.</text>

            <text syncTime="2413.482" offset="9792704">If in fact lawyers residing out of state but admitted to the New Hampshire bar pose such a substantial problem, then why has New Hampshire not even made any effort to count how many there are?</text>

            <text syncTime="3043.982" offset="12314669">I think this Court has consistently recognized the importance of regulation of the legal profession, and the special interests that courts have in this area, but this Court has also consistently recognized that that discretion and that special interest is never sufficient ground for violating a constitutionally protected right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.597" offset="12409128">And that the four state Supreme Courts which have considered in adversarial fashion whether a state residency requirement violates the privileges and immunities clause have all found that it does.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jon Meyer</label>
            <text syncTime="3261.507" offset="13184756">No, I don't, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.757" offset="13189771">But if... I want to emphasize that we believe there are adequately in place adequate protections of attorney knowledge of local rules and procedures, and in fact lawyers are tested on it, but if they are not sufficient, then the state has open to it numerous other means of assuring that knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.671" offset="13273468">For example, requiring continuing legal education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.807" offset="13286007">For example, requiring a linkage between less and more experienced attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.044" offset="13306905">And we think that the need to exclude all out of staters is both unconnected and too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.232" offset="13343685">Now, there is also a concern, a justification raised about concern about your reputation in the legal community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.172" offset="13375450">But we think that what counts is not the legal community... is not the community you live in, but the legal community you practice in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.130" offset="13419231">And if an attorney practices in New Hampshire, that should be more than adequate assurance that he is concerned about his reputation in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.800" offset="13445980">And if he doesn't practice in New Hampshire, you don't really care.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.752" offset="13457788">But I would also like to point out that for lawyers who practice in more than one jurisdiction, under the New Hampshire Supreme Court rules there is a requirement that anybody suspended or disbarred, that that be sent to all of the jurisdictions where the attorney practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.661" offset="13521422">So that would surely provide, in our opinion, a substantial incentive for any attorney to conform to the opinions of his New Hampshire peers.</text>
