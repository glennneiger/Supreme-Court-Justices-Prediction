            <text syncTime="117.839" offset="603266">In February of 1977, shortly after leaving office, President Ford signed a publishing agreement with Harper &amp; Row and the Reader's Digest to publish his memoirs.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.225" offset="928752">President Ford reviewed that manuscript word for word, and he then reviewed three subsequent revisions word for word before finally giving his okay for the manuscript to be published.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.282" offset="977026">In March, 1979, approximately two years later, Harper &amp; Row's subsidiary right department began to contact newspapers and magazines to ascertain if any of them were interested in publishing excerpts from this book prior to book publication, a right that is referred to in the book publishing trade as "first serial rights".</text>
            <text syncTime="235.548" offset="1074097">In circulating that manuscript, the subsidiary rights department secured a confidentiality agreement from each of the firms to whom it was given.</text>

            <text syncTime="265.620" offset="1194365">That agreement was entered into in the middle of March, 1979.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.804" offset="1287048">Approximately two weeks later, a copy of the manuscript found its way into the hands of the editor of The Nation Magazine.</text>

            <text syncTime="2233.767" offset="9066940">They sold 418 copies of this altogether on newsstands, so it's not the sort of thing one would ordinarily think of in terms of magazines or newspapers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2257.763" offset="9162862">First, we see what is it that we're supposed to count, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.887" offset="9179371">The whole work is copyrighted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.987" offset="9187835">I say again, there is no question about that, President Ford wrote a copyrightable work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.760" offset="9202881">But it's clear, and we don't disagree with our opponents, that we are entitled as a general matter to make what Professor Latman called "unlimited use" of material in that copyrighted work which is not copyrighted subject to however this court comes out on the issue of structure, mosaic, or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.812" offset="9287100">Justice Stevens asked earlier for some examples and, if I may, I would like to just cite one or two to give you an example of where we think the court can look to make a decision as to whether the Second Circuit approach was a correct approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.042" offset="9340076">At page 633 of the Joint Appendix, in the midst of our paragraph by paragraph analysis of the article, we quote from the article in paragraph 4... of The Nation article.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.492" offset="9401830">Paragraph 4 of The Nation article says, and I will just paraphrase it now, that Ford's account contained significant new details on the negotiations and consideration when the subject was first broached to him by General Haig on August 1st, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.122" offset="9468390">General Haig revealed that the newly transcribed White House tapes were the equivalent of the smoking gun, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.767" offset="9494930">That came from what we then annex immediately after page 633, which is pages 634, 635, 636, and 637.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.665" offset="9542473">It was, I would use the word, news, if you went to say condensed, paraphrased, it was a report about that aspect of what President Ford did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.542" offset="9593986">The same thing is true of the example that Mr. Miller cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.407" offset="9613526">I think it is a good example of the Ruth Memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.437" offset="9621572">At page 654 of the Joint Appendix, there is a paragraph from The Nation article in which The Nation wrote that the precipitating factor in Ford's decision was a series of secret meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.579" offset="9678205">Then they go down to say that Ford's cites a memorandum from Henry Ruth as being especially persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.930" offset="9703596">"Ruth had written".</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.893" offset="9715404">Where we disagree is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.134" offset="9724390">President Ford never owned the Ruth Memorandum, and we believe that he doesn't own it today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.469" offset="9745706">What the District Court said was that when you put the Ruth Memorandum together with how President Ford used it, the totality was protected, and that is why we get to 700 words, because they include the Ruth Memorandum in the 700 words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.199" offset="9812684">Our position is that the totality doctrine is absolutely unprecedented in copyright law, and terribly dangerous because that doctrine would, in fact, give Harper &amp; Row a monopoly of the story of the pardon of President Nixon by President Ford.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.531" offset="9886035">I want to add one thing to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.912" offset="9895544">They're right when they say that the monopoly they would get is the monopoly in President Ford's version of that story.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.317" offset="9921144">That's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.316" offset="9925115">Mr. Navasky could have gone out and written a whole article about the pardon, but his article was about President Ford's version of the pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.814" offset="9959074">What I believe their argument comes down to is that that sort of article cannot be written about at least published work without violating the copyright law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.981" offset="10003795">That's what it is, because if you once say, you can't paraphrase, what you are saying is, you can't report what the books says about that, what happened next.</text>

            <text syncTime="2543.540" offset="10305980">His position and the lower court's position was that when you looked at it all together, this was President Ford's version, this was his depiction of the pardon.</text>
