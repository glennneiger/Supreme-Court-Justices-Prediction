            <label>Mr. Lawrence Gerald Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="13.841" offset="186491">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a follow-up to last term's decision in Ruckelshaus against Monsanto Company in which this Court sustained the constitutionality of the data use and disclosure provisions of the federal statute regulating the marketing and sale of pesticides, known as FIFRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.645" offset="321701">The Court will recall that the data involved are not formulas of pesticide products, but they are health and safety testing data, and those are used by EPA in granting registrations to subsequent applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.514" offset="441237">Under the statutory scheme they are not required to duplicate the testings, but are to share in the cost of generating the test data.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.956" offset="478958">There is no issue in the present case with respect to public disclosure of the data.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.226" offset="512081">That portion of FIFRA is not involved here, because the compensation scheme which is at issue does not relate to public disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.783" offset="558266">It relates only to use of the data within EPA in support of the subsequent application.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.189" offset="587941">The subsequent applicant is not given access to the data for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.193" offset="611974">He merely cites the existence of such data from an index.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.514" offset="637260">This Court last term held that the District Court had acted prematurely in the Monsanto case in holding that the system for sharing the costs of generating the data, the system of compulsory arbitration that is provided for if the parties cannot reach agreement violated Article 3 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.681" offset="749900">The Court held that that issue was not ripe for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.135" offset="763693">It then vacated and remanded the present case, and the District Court held that that issue was ripe in the present case, and that those provisions did violate Article 3, and enjoined the enforcement of the entire licensing, if one might call it that, and compensation system for registering subsequent applicants, and the case is on appeal from that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.875" offset="906635">Now, except for the Stauffer Chemical Company, the remaining appellees are in the identical situation that Monsanto was in last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.449" offset="956999">None of them has been a party to any arbitration proceeding, and their situation is squarely controlled by the holding that the issue was not ripe with respect to Monsanto.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.559" offset="1013423">And our first contention is that here, too, the issue is not ripe for adjudication, but we also have contentions on the merits to follow through with.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.600" offset="1057518">The question as to whether it is ripe with respect to Stauffer Chemical Company is only a little more complicated, but we believe that the same result should follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.526" offset="1117286">Stauffer has been a party to one arbitration proceeding under the statute against PPG Industries, but Stauffer has not either in the present case or in a case that is pending between the two companies in the District Court for the District of Columbia contested the result of that arbitration award as not meeting the statutory standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.833" offset="1266498">The Court said in the Monsanto case that the operation of the arbitration procedure affects only in that case Monsanto's ability to vindicate its statutory right to obtain compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.059" offset="1327415">It is PPG which claims that Monsanto has been overcompensated by the arbitrator's award, and while Monsanto is asking that the entire system of allowing a competitor a registration be struck down so that it can still market its no longer patented product free of competition, it is not asking that the award be set aside or augmented in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.553" offset="1485404">Presumably this is a tactical decision to restrict the scope of review, and I think if one turns to the award itself, one can understand that it is really Stauffer that has won the award for all practical purposes, and at least is taking that stance in the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.120" offset="1591670">I should point out that the District Court in this case on remand, and this is printed at Page 30 of the Joint Appendix, the appellees specifically said that plaintiffs do not in this case challenge the result of an arbitration, nor does the adjudication of plaintiff's claims depend in any manner on the outcome of an arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.520" offset="1705250">And in the case pending in the District Court for the District of Columbia, Stauffer is asking for enforcement of the award, or in the alternative, that PPG not be allowed to market the product at all, and that Stauffer be awarded damages in the amount of the arbitrator's award.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.822" offset="1802426">The award is set forth in the Joint Appendix, and if one turns to Page 54 of the Joint Appendix, one can see what was awarded to Stauffer by the arbitrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.134" offset="1875673">There are two elements to the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.668" offset="1889884">Paragraph A awards the sum of $1,465,000, which is explained two page earlier to be one-half the sum of $2,930,000, which was the cost generated in getting the data that were submitted to EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.903" offset="1998762">And then there is the plus, Part B, running compensation for the calendar years 1983 through 1992 of 15 cents per pound, for every pound of product that PPG sells, and there is a fraction there which is intended to be an inflation adjustment, which so long as the Consumer Price Index continues to rise will have the effect of increasing the 15 cents slightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.694" offset="2153929">And on the preceding page, Page 53, the arbitrators estimated that during the first five years of that ten-year period, PPG would sell 47,250,000 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.091" offset="2227490">If one multiplies that by 15 cents, it comes to about $7 million, and that is only for the first five of the ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.899" offset="2274720">Obviously, added to the $1,465,000, it would exceed the total cost of generating the data many times over.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.705" offset="2317978">Now, our own view of the legislative history set forth on Page 4 of the reply brief that we have filed in this case indicates that Congress was quite clear that it meant the awards in these cases to be a device for sharing the cost of generating the data and not to include something extraneous which is really in the nature of a patent royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.961" offset="2463010">Even though there has been no claim that a patented process was used in generating these test data, we don't know of any instance in which anyone has gotten a patent on any process used in generating the data.</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="597.973" offset="2523092">Mr. Wallace, are you suggesting that Part B of the award is improper?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_gerald_wallace" startTime="601.774" stopTime="646.469">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence Gerald Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="601.774" offset="2538243">That is the view that we have taken about what the proper statutory standard is, but the Court... I am not saying the Court should reach that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.296" offset="2576382">My point is that there may well be reason why Stauffer would be fearful of having the question of modifying the award or setting it aside addressed in Court, because Stauffer, while it made a larger claim to the arbitrators, has steadfastly refrained from making an effort to set aside or augment the award in any court because it would imply that the award could be modified in the other direction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1157.686" offset="4761890">In our view, this question does not require the Court to consider the broad spectrum of issues that were discussed in the Northern Pipeline case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1176.315" offset="4836392">It is not merely that the case does not involve a common law type of claim under state law, but the fact of the matter is, this case not only involves a claim only under a federal statute creating a recently claimed right, a recently created right, but it involves a relationship between the two parties which itself would not exist were it not for the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.536" offset="4965332">The very relationship between the two parties is a creature of the federal statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1216.973" offset="4999082">They don't have a relationship that could give rise to a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.276" offset="5020294">All that is happening is that they are competing in selling an unpatented product which itself would not give rise to a legal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.684" offset="5065851">The nearest analogy would be under a state law of unfair competition, but obviously it cannot violate state law merely to compete in the sale of an unpatented product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.511" offset="5125201">The federal antitrust laws and patent laws would preclude that kind of a state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1280.065" offset="5251425">On the other hand, it is only the government that is using the testing data for purposes of conferring the second registration, and the statutory scheme is based on the idea that the public will benefit from competition, that the public health and safety will be adequately provided for without duplication of the testing, if the testing was adequately done in the first place, but that the innovator who went through the testing should not be discouraged from that, and should have the costs shared with the competing registrant who is going to enter the market and compete against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.565" offset="5449433">All of that is for a public purpose, and the duty to compensate arises wholly from the statute, and the use of the data arises wholly from the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1360.017" offset="5571268">Congress conditioned the ability to market that product on a sharing of the test generating costs, and that is the sole basis for the claim here.</text>
