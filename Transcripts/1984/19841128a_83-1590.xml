            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="140607">We will hear arguments first this morning in Francis v. Franklin.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.727" offset="171431">Ms. Boleyn, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="susan_v_boleyn" startTime="14.172" stopTime="233.252">
            <label>Ms. Susan V. Boleyn</label>
            <text syncTime="14.172" offset="197240">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, there are the major points that are the question for the Court's resolution in this case, and I'd like to briefly outline those points before going back and addressing them in more detail for the Court's consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.989" offset="252516">The State of Georgia originally sought a petition for writ of certiorari in this case because of our great concern about the ramifications of the holding of the Eleventh Circuit in connection with its finding about the Sandstrom violation that it found in this case and the application of the reasonable juror test in Sandstrom to state court instructions, especially in the context of a federal habeas corpus case.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.473" offset="342481">As we stated in our brief to the Court, we contend that the Eleventh Circuit both misinterpreted and misapplied the holding of the Supreme Court in Sandstrom v. Montana and specifically unnecessarily broadened the reasonable juror test set forth by the Court in that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.435" offset="414266">We contend that the charge considered as a whole in this case was permissive in nature, did not have a mandatory effect on the jury, and did not interfere with the fact-finding ability of the jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.363" offset="462018">The second point that we wish to discuss this morning is our contention that the Eleventh Circuit properly considered whether or not harmless error rule would prohibit the granting of the writ of habeas corpus in this case, but then improperly decided that the harmless error rule under the facts of this case did not prohibit the granting of the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.446" offset="542370">It's our contention that harmless error would have prohibited the granting of the writ, as it's our contention that there was overwhelming evidence of the Respondent's guilt of murder, and that his defense to the charges was, in fact, frivolous if the facts of the case are examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.836" offset="603915">The validity of the holding in Francis v. Franklin is important to us for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.961" offset="628365">First of all, at the time that Mr. Franklin was tried, this charge that is the subject of the Court's review today was a standard charge utilized by many of the state courts in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.168" offset="673191">And, in effect, there are 31 death penalty cases pending in the Elevent Circuit which potentially may be affected by this Court's decision in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.824" offset="703807">Of course, the potential impact of the harmless error rule is very great in Georgia, as if all of these 31 cases, for example, did have a charge found to be violative of Sandstrom, the application of the harmless error rule might prevent needless retrial in cases where the doubt... there is no doubt, excuse me, as to the guilt of the Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.306" offset="785831">The procedural history in this case, we contend, is very important for the Court's consideration of these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.350" offset="813939">First of all, the Georgia Supreme Court in the Respondent's direct appeal to that court, found that under the principles of Sandstrom, the effect of the instruction was to merely create a permissive instruction, and that it was not unconstitutionally burden shifting.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.329" offset="873916">Next, of course, in the federal habeas corpus court, the district court found that under the principles of Sandstrom, the charge in this case was distinguishable from that found to be unconstitutional in Sandstrom, because there was additional language considering the court's charge as whole which indicated that the charge was, in effect, permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.365" offset="954060">The Eleventh Circuit then considered the case on appeal and determined that the effect of the contested portion of the charge was mandatory; therefore, the charge was unconstitutional; therefore, federal habeas corpus relief should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.863" offset="1007977">It's interesting to note that after the decision of the Eleventh Circuit in the Franklin case, the court had the occasion on several other times to consider a similar charge, sometimes finding that the similar charge violated the Constitution and sometimes finding that it didn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.511" offset="1302638">What the courts have held, the Eleventh Circuit held in the Holloway case that there are three essential elements to murder in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.166" offset="1329178">And, of course, they relied on Georgia case law in making that determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="757.837" offset="3171856">Or do you think an answer is possible, well, a reasonable juror might have understood them as permissive or might have understood them as mandatory; that either one would be reasonable?</text>

            <text syncTime="1226.969" offset="5048388">Yes, it was presented in the initial petition for certiorari from the affirmance of the conviction by the Georgia Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.072" offset="5076809">I believe, as I've said in this particular charge, the malice instruction was very significant and, of course, the challenged instruction itself was distinguishable from that reviewed by the court in Sandstrom, in that the jury was specifically told as soon as the presumption was given, that the presumption was rebuttable and that a person will not be presumed to act with criminal intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.121" offset="5181090">The jurors were told that they should say, after consideration of all the facts and circumstances, whether reasonable doubt existed and that they should be concerned that the verdict... and I believe the words the judge used,</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.078" offset="5232917">"speaks the truth of the case on the facts as you find them. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.450" offset="5246396">He told the jurors that malice must exist before the alleged homicide could be murder, and he told the jurors that the Defendant contended, by his not guilty plea, that the material elements of the offense had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the homicide was an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.232" offset="5309508">Apparently, what the Eleventh Circuit seems to be doing in its decision in Franklin is compelling, through its habeas corpus powers, specific language in trial courts' instructions to the jury on intent, as it did with the case law to its federal trial courts in its supervisory capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.003" offset="5380561">Essentially, our contention is that the federal habeas corpus courts are trying to oversimplify the reasonable juror test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.308" offset="5405743">They want to look for magic words and say that this compels the conclusion that it's a mandatory instruction and that habeas corpus relief should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.626" offset="5439076">And our basic contention is that before the conclusion is made as to the effect of the charge, and whether it's permissive, mandatory, or burden shifting, that the trial court's charge as a whole must be reviewed, as well as the circumstances of the case, including the offense that he's charged with, as essential elements, the defenses that the Respondent brings up and the strength of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.879" offset="5528101">Of course, we contend that if the reasonable juror test was properly applied in this case, that no habeas corpus relief would have been granted by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.824" offset="5563836">The remainder of the trial court's instructions neutralized any potentially mandatory interpretation that a reasonable juror could make of these constructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.081" offset="5600930">If there are not further questions on whether or not there was a Sandstrom violation as an initial matter, I'll move to my discussion of the harmless error rule in connection with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.117" offset="5636979">With respect to the harmless error rule, I think it's important to note that there was no procedural bar to this Court considering the harmless error question, because it was considered by the Eleventh Circuit below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.515" offset="5686612">It said that Chapman v. California harmless error test was applicable in Sandstrom violations, but then of course our disagreement is with their finding that under the Chapman test, it was not harmless error in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.245" offset="5745544">Of course, as I've already said, we contend that there was overwhelming evidence of the Respondent's intent to murder and his malice and all of the other essential elements of the offense, and that there was simply no question but that he shot and killed Mr. Collie with malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.335" offset="5809910">His defense to this crime was, in effect, frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.578" offset="5826837">What his statement said after it was admitted at trial was that the gun went off when the door slammed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.763" offset="5851601">That's the phrase that he used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.483" offset="5858498">And then mysteriously, for some unknown reason, and unexplained in his confession, the gun simply went off again, and as I said, he said it must...</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.339" offset="5893920">"I must have cocked the gun again for some other reason. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.781" offset="5907712">His defense to the crime was just frivolous in the sense that the defense attorney tried to say that he was excited because he had escaped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.507" offset="5942612">He was fearful, and that when the door slammed, it somehow scared him into pulling the trigger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.289" offset="5961734">Of course, that doesn't explain, we submit, why he eventually fired the second shot that was right over the Defendant's wife's head and in her general direction, and it doesn't explain why he opened the door of Mr. Collie's home, stepped over the fallen body of Mr. Collie, rifled through his pockets looking for the victim's car keys, and when there were no car keys in Mr. Collie's pockets, he proceeds to chase his wife and daughter throughout the house, threatening them with bodily harm and placing the gun to the temple of Mrs. Collie's head.</text>

            <text syncTime="1563.090" offset="6392963">In the opening statement that defense counsel made on the Petitioner's behalf, he stated that his version of the facts did not differ significantly from the State's version, and at the time of his closing argument, defense counsel said Raymond Franklin did fire the shot that killed Claude Collie, but he didn't kill any other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.865" offset="6480003">He did take Carol Heitmuller from the dentist's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.706" offset="6495363">So he, in fact, admitted that his client had fired the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.179" offset="6509260">He said the door slammed in his face and "bang", The gun went off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.412" offset="6530158">He simply tried to reiterate to the jury that the Respondent was scared, excited, didn't hurt anyone else, and perhaps was suffering from the effect of the novocaine in his body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.431" offset="6578328">Assuming, but not conceding, that there has been a Sandstrom violation, it's our position that the harmless error rule should be applied on the facts of this case, due to the overwhelming nature of the evidence against the Respondent and the frivolous nature of his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.299" offset="6629737">The relief which we would request from the Court is, as an initial matter, that the Eleventh Circuit's finding that there was a Sandstrom violation in the case be reversed and that the case be remanded for consideration of the other issues because the only issue that the Eleventh Circuit decided was, in fact, the Sandstrom violation issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.461" offset="6702357">If this Court should determine that an affirmance of the Eleventh Circuit's finding on the Sandstrom violation is appropriate, we would then ask that the Court go ahead in its authority and apply the harmless error rule to the facts of this case, and therefore prohibit the granting of federal habeas corpus relief under these facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1674.332" offset="6837880">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I'd like to address first the issue of whether this charge was unconstitutional under Sandstrom, and later cover the harmless error point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.760" offset="6883647">I think it's interesting to note that the Eleventh Circuit panel that decided this case included Judge Hill who was on the panel which decided the Corn case which you have been hearing so much about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.859" offset="6932026">I believe that this indicates that while the Eleventh Circuit does have numerous cases involving Sandstrom errors and alleged Sandstrom errors, they are perfectly capable of not adopting some bright line test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.458" offset="6986360">They are capable of looking carefully at the charge as a whole and deciding whether a reasonable juror could have been misled by that into effectively shifting the burden of persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.196" offset="7033381">And I would also indicate that Sandstrom itself makes clear that although it's possible that reasonable jurors could view the charge in different ways, that the facts that you must look at it is that if one of those ways in which a reasonable juror could have construed the charge is an unconstitutional way that shifts the burden of proof, the mere fact that other reasonable jurors might have interpreted differently does not make the charge constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.865" offset="7151977">And that is squarely indicated in the Sandstrom holding itself, and the State's position to the contrary ignores Sandstrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.369" offset="7182070">Now, looking at the charge in this case, the jury was first told as a precursor to these charges that they were about to hear legal definitions from the Georgia Criminal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.476" offset="7226478">And then, in language very reminiscent of the Sandstrom case's language, they were told that acts of person of a sound mind and discretion are presumed to be the product of the person's will, and that a person of sound mind and discretion is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.379" offset="7302024">In Sandstrom, those presumptions were held unconstitutional under either of two possible interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.913" offset="7328251">The first was that this was an irrebutable conclusive presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.975" offset="7344447">But the second one is that it was a rebuttable mandatory presumption, and that second interpretation is the one that applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.382" offset="7382063">Presumption that the jury is required to use unless it is rebutted is unconstitutional under Sanstrom, unless, as never occurred here, the jury is told by what quantum of evidence the presumption must be rebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.631" offset="7439115">Sandstrom held that that kind of presumption is unconstitutional because a reasonable juror might construe it as requiring considerably more than some evidence to rebut it; therefore, had the effect of shifting the burden of persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.922" offset="7496271">The same constitutional problem is present here because the jury was given what were billed as legal definitions, and was told that they are to be presumed... this is to be presumed... were not given any ifs, ands, or buts about it; all they were told is that it was rebuttable, but they were not told at all what quantum of evidence was required to rebut this charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.487" offset="7586550">Now, the State claims that the charge's language on rebuttability distinguishes the case from Sandstrom; that that, first of all, ignores the fact that Sandstrom held that a rebuttable presumption which the jury is required to use is unconstitutional unless the nature of the rebuttability is explained so that a reasonable juror could not believe that considerably more than some evidence was required to rebut it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2411.225" offset="9785433">But, in fact, as the Eleventh Circuit carefully pointed out, they could have made them consistent because what makes intent criminal in a malice murder case is that it be without mitigation, justification, or excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.974" offset="9840499">And they might well have realized that they could use the mandatory presumption in order to find the intent to kill, and then they would not be allowed to presume the absence of mitigation, justification, or excuse.</text>

            <text syncTime="2453.722" offset="9955438">These do not eliminate the danger that the jury could use the presumption as a means by which the State satisfied the burden of proof unless the Defendant presented considerably more than some evidence in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.832" offset="10007892">Finally, the State has pointed to the charge the Defendant need not produce evidence of mitigation, justification, or excuse, but as I've just pointed out, that refers to the malice part of the charge which has the unlawful, deliberate intention to kill, without justification, mitigation, or excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.453" offset="10078318">Now, the defense in this case was that the Defendant did not intend to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.357" offset="10101933">Look at the opening statement of the defense counsel; he stated Defendant went to that house without any intention to kill anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.740" offset="10131503">Throughout his cross-examination of the various State witnesses, his whole purpose was to show a lack of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.705" offset="10159402">He never tried to show something like self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.108" offset="10172986">He did not claim that there was a heat of passion on sudden provocation or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.161" offset="10197227">His defense was Defendant did not have the intent to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.204" offset="10209348">As I've mentioned, this accident charge actually increased the danger that the jury would effectively place on the Defendant the burden of persuasion on intent, because the jury as repeatedly told... and as Justice Stevens, I believe, noted... during their deliberations were again told that a person shall not be found guilty of a crime committed by misfortune or accident where it satisfactorily appears there was no criminal scheme or undertaking or intention or criminal negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.384" offset="10330138">Under this instruction, the only way to find someone not guilty where the Defendant contends that there was an accident, is if it satisfactorily appears that that there was no intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.481" offset="10374442">A reasonable juror could easily construe this as effectively putting on the Defendant the burden of persuasion, of disproving intention, because who else but the Defendant would want to make it satisfactorily appear that there was no intention?</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.310" offset="10433792">Only the Defendant would want to make that satisfactorily appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.593" offset="10446958">And the language</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.694" offset="10451347">"appear that there be no intention. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.815" offset="10459810">seems to require an affirmative finding of no intention, not that the prosecutor failed to prove intention beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.850" offset="10491993">And thus, I would submit that when the charge as a whole is considered, the danger does remain that a reasonable juror could have construed the presumption here as requiring rebuttal by considerably more than some evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.211" offset="10549358">And, therefore, under Sandstrom this charge was unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="3258.040" offset="13172679">The second shot, I believe, was an nervous reaction to the first one, which he had never intended to fire, and went off... if he had intended to shoot someone, Your Honor, he would not have shot it right up into the ceiling near no one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.648" offset="13227118">That would not be... and he would then not have run away from the house upon shooting that shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.852" offset="13251987">That is not what he would have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.605" offset="13258987">But I must emphasize that while this sounds like a closing argument to the jury, the point is that what should have happened is that the defense counsel who did make the closing argument to the jury should have made it to a jury who had been properly instructed with respect to the burden of persuasion on intent, because this is not like a case that was described in Connecticut v. Johnson's dissent, of people being shot 50 times in the chest, or being stabbed 42 times, and throwing somebody off of a bridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.904" offset="13384166">This was a very different event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.296" offset="13393779">And under these circumstances, whether or not I persuade you beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance or anything else, the point is maybe I haven't persuaded you by a preponderance of the evidence, but that's the very problem; not because I'm not a good advocate, but the problem is that the burden of persuasion that the jury may actually have applied in this case would have required the defense counsel, or could have required the defense counsel to demonstrate the absence of intent by a preponderance of the evidence, and it is for that very reason that this charge is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.186" offset="13521257">Now, it is possible that in a retrial, if the jury is properly charged or the issue of intent, maybe he will be found guilty again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.923" offset="13556261">But that's the right this Defendant has.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.855" offset="13563993">He has the right, under the United States Constitution, to be... if he is found guilty of malice murder, he has the right to have had that trial done in conformance with due process, with a properly charged jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.433" offset="13614253">And that is why we believe that even under the dissents test in Connecticut v. Johnson, that this was not a harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.216" offset="13649466">Now, we do believe that the plurality test in Connecticut v. Johnson does have application here, and should be applied here because this is not a case in which the Defendant did not have any evidence on his side and didn't have the matter in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.960" offset="13724385">And therefore, to rule in... using the dissent test in this case, would be to have this Court substitute itself for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.737" offset="13763464">And that's what we would urge that it not be done, but again, even under that test, we submit that that's standard could not be met because a reasonable juror, properly instructed, might have found a reasonable doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="3421.746" offset="13827516">Your Honor, we would just like to reiterate for the Court's consideration that in considering both whether or not there was an initial Sandstrom violation and in considering the harmless error issue, that our view of the evidence is that it overwhelmingly showed the Respondent's intent to kill and that the true argument of defense counsel in his behalf was that he did not intend to kill anybody when he went to the house; that the purpose in going to the house of Mr. Collie was because there were three cars sitting in the yard, and he thought he could get a set of car keys to these cars at gunpoint and by cocking the gun and frightening these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.582" offset="13978922">So our view of the evidence is that it overwhelmingly establishes all of the essential elements of murder in the case.</text>
