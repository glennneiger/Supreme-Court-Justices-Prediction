            <text syncTime="19.759" offset="219080">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case turns on the proper construction of a treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.333" offset="249382">It also involves important considerations of judicial restraint under our constitutional system in the treatymaking process.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.485" offset="281983">The treaty is the Warsaw Convention, the agreement governing it a national aviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.610" offset="302463">This Court considered and enforce the liability ceilings under that treaty last term in its Franklin Mint decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.888" offset="331616">We are asking the Court now to consider and enforce prerequisites for that liability under the Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.667" offset="358679">As the Court has noted this treaty has been in effect now for over 50 years, and has provided stable and internationally uniform rules governing international air transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.551" offset="402251">There is, however, now pending a balanced package of amendments to the Warsaw Convention which have not yet been ratified by the U.S. Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.564" offset="442270">As the Court noted last term, those amendments remain on a... calendar.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.374" offset="461497">The majority below has nevertheless upon judicial fiat enacted only one of those amendments by removing a prerequisite for carrier liability for personal injuries under the treaty as it now stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.198" offset="512801">In so doing, the majority has misinterpreted the treaty and has inappropriately interfered with the treatymaking powers of the political branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.507" offset="550104">In this case we ask the Court to enforce the provisions of Article 17 of the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.566" offset="574346">That article establishes as a prerequisite for carrier liability for passenger injury and death claims the requirement that such injuries or death be caused by an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.310" offset="625232">That prerequisite for liability has been universally recognized by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.013" offset="648115">The Third Circuit has properly, in our view, applied that prerequisite in its DeMarines decision by stating its two basic elements, first, that there be an accident, and second, that that accident proximately caused the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.301" offset="713213">The majority below has acknowledged the requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.175" offset="728782">However, in the guise of treaty construction, their decision would effectively abolish that requirement by allowing recovery where a flight has been normal in all respects and no accident has occurred to cause the injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="738.201" offset="3092863">Article 20 gave a basis to come back with a due care defense and say it wasn't the carrier's fault to avoid liability, but it is absolutely essential to realize that Article 17 was not at all addressed to the Montreal Agreement, as pointed out by the U.S. government's brief to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="764.378" offset="3197562">I think the task for this Court is simply to decide what the accident requirement means.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.939" offset="3211773">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.907" offset="3215639">There is a very good analogy, I believe, to what the majority below has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.702" offset="3234865">It is the strict product liability doctrine, where a manufacturer is held absolutely liable for the consequences of defects in their products.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.528" offset="3262137">They are not held liable for all the injuries caused by their products.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.885" offset="3279586">So the task as I see it under the Warsaw Convention now is to recognize that there must be an accident before the absolute liability doctrine comes into play under the Montreal Agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="807.783" offset="3371119">Aircraft are not expected to slam on their brakes and throw passengers out of their seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.937" offset="3387733">It is a broad standard that the Third Circuit has enunciated to try to effect the intention of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.106" offset="3412497">I think it is important, though, to come back to the narrow issue presented by this case, and it is whether the respondent's injury in this case was caused by an accident within the meaning of Article 17, and the question is whether the everyday normal conduct of an aircraft, in fact the necessary operation of an aircraft pressurization system can be the independent accident that causes the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.972" offset="3515942">As the Court well knows, the beginning point in the construction of a treaty is, of course, the language of the treaty itself, which should be construed to avoid rendering any word meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.670" offset="3554708">This Court has recognized, as it did last term in Franklin Mint and long ago in the amiable Isabella, that the courts are not at liberty to dispense with any of the conditions or requirements of the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.853" offset="3603400">If we adopted the respondent's view of what the Warsaw Convention means, you could simply withdraw that phrase if the accident which caused, and just go on to say that the damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.943" offset="3643838">There is no basis in the history of this Convention to suggest the majority view below is correct, and the decision below has departed from these basic principles by reading the word "accident" to mean any occurrence associated with the operation of the aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.216" offset="3704860">Carrier liability under Article 17 requires that the injury be caused by an accident, not by an occurrence, and this should be compared, Justice O'Connor, with the language in Article 18, where the word "occurrence" is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.587" offset="3758359">As I indicated, the Convention's history and the comments of the president of the drafting committee to my mind indicate that that was a deliberate choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.287" offset="3789183">Also, the parties' subsequent construction of the treaty, which is also ignored by the majority below, confirms that the respondent is now asking this Court to amend Article 17 as it now stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.749" offset="3855012">I speak specifically of the proposed treaty amendments adopted in the Guatemala City Protocal of 1971 and included in the 1985 protocols, which as this Court recognized still await Senate ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.245" offset="3905062">Several proposed amendments were adopted in those two diplomatic conferences which constitute a balanced package significantly increasing the carrier's scope of liability, increasing the liability limits in an exchange for more a unbreakable ceiling on carrier liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.582" offset="3974339">Part of the proposed compromise specifically amends Article 17 to change the word from "accident" to "event".</text>
            <text syncTime="967.547" offset="4010179">If the amendments are adopted, the carriers will become liable for a broader class of injuries not now covered by the Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.574" offset="4042362">The pending amendment to Article 17 reads exactly like what respondent is proposing this Court should have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.914" offset="4071724">The treaty parties, however, have not yet adopted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.007" offset="4088024">The present treaty is limited to injuries caused by accidents and not by normal events or occurrences.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.255" offset="4113102">You mentioned the Montreal Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.659" offset="4142672">Both the respondent and the majority below assert that that 1966 private agreement among international air carriers effectively removed the Convention's act as a prerequisites for carrier liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.795" offset="4183214">The U.S.'s brief explains, as does the history, that that agreement addressed only the due care defense and in no way affected the prerequisites for carrier liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.603" offset="4222398">The task of this Court is to apply the provisions of Article 17 as they now stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.583" offset="4266388">The rewriting and renegotiation of treaties are the tasks of the political branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.768" offset="4291152">You have the amicus briefs of two of the principal acting nations responsible for the Warsaw system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1727.054" offset="7048220">There was a balance and a quid pro quo between the other signatories in the United States to do two things only, only two things.</text>

            <text syncTime="1944.497" offset="7917993">If we could imagine ourselves back in 1929, when aviation was admittedly and according to a CAP memo we cited an extremely risky mode of transportation, and imagine ourselves at an airport where we are watching passengers embark and disembark onto prop planes which today would be museum pieces, and say on Day One, because of the normal routine spinning of the prop, a boarding passenger has a piece of glass or a particle or something flung into his eye, causing blindness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.061" offset="8048292">The next week, a passenger is boarding, and due to the normal, routine noise made by the prop on the plane he is boarding or one nearby, he suffers a total hearing loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.698" offset="8102835">The next week, we are on the plane itself, and due to the normal, routine noise inside this insulated passenger cabin, another passenger suffers a hearing loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.912" offset="8151632">Wouldn't the original framers have intended, and their primary purpose was to protect these fledgling airlines with a liability ceiling, wouldn't they have intended to have this ceiling protect these airlines from potentially ruinous liability to allow these airlines to not only have their operating costs, but to channel money into research and development to correct these types of deficiencies, or, as petitioner suggests, would the framers have intended that these injuries, that the airlines be exposed to unlimited exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.378" offset="8329578">If we imagined back in 1929 that at year's end there are not just these three people but a half-dozen more or 30 more lined up at the county clerk's office, complaint in hand, alleging $50, 000 each in provable damages, surely the original framers would have wanted these fledgling, financially insecure airlines protected in those situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.556" offset="8414215">Now, Justice Stevens raised an important point with regard to air turbulence, because the entire thrust and common thread throughout the cases dealing with the Warsaw Convention is the interest to protect both the airline and the passenger from risks inherent in air travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.061" offset="8516302">The petitioner stresses that the common thread is really a sudden, unexpected occurrence, but let's look at air turbulence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.574" offset="8550365">When you board the plane, the pilot says to you, fasten your seat belt and keep it fastened when you are seated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.306" offset="8569278">The pilot may thereafter come on the intercom and say, we can expect to experience turbulence at this time, over this state, and it is going to be this rough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.051" offset="8620269">Yet no court has questioned the right of the passenger to recover in that situation where due to the totally anticipated usual and expected turbulence he suffers some kind of injury.</text>
