            <text syncTime="96.647" offset="508961">Our position, Petitioner's position, is quite simply that it should not and cannot be excluded, that it is awardable under the specific language of 42 U.S.C. Section 1988 and under the decisions of this Court that interpret that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.939" offset="578133">Our position is, first, that if that time, as we contend it was here, is reasonably expended, reasonably spent, then within the meaning of Section 1988 and this Court's decision in Hensley versus Eckerhart, then it can be compensated for.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.359" offset="647828">That is, it is chargeable to the defendant when the plaintiff prevails in his federal court action.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.855" offset="869869">So there's certainly no intention of Congress or the decisions of this Court to discourage the going and utilization of an available state remedy, which is precisely the result of the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.396" offset="923994">The result would be to tell to a potential plaintiff that, go straight into federal court, do not spend any time at all pursuing any other available remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.334" offset="1591789">But to give an example, we said in our brief, the basic claim of Mr. Webb was that everything was fine in his employment until integration came and he, a black teacher, was assigned to teach in a predominantly white school and he imposed the same kind of discipline he had imposed throughout his career on a white student, and that was the reason why he was discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.568" offset="1676634">Now, assume for the moment... and he presented evidence to support that claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="395.693" offset="1705160">A document had appeared saying that a black teacher who disciplined white students should be discharged.</text>

            <text syncTime="545.281" offset="2303573">Pages 39 to 47 set out the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.193" offset="2315171">But everything prior to the work done in August of 1977 to actually prepare to go to federal court was excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.168" offset="2343070">And in that time such things were done as to investigate the case, talk to witnesses, talk to the client, to in fact in effect have depositions of two witnesses, at least two witnesses of the defendant... all time that would be compensable if it had been done in connection with the federal court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.532" offset="2424572">Yet it's excluded, absolutely simply because that work was done in connection with the state administrative proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1110.946" offset="4566195">And as we've pointed out in our brief, the time spent in preparation to filing the investigation and talking to people is an important amount of time spent, and certainly a substantial amount of the time spent was very comparable to just what one would do through discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.497" offset="4628366">This Court has pointed out, for example, in Chandler versus Rotabush that the time... the record of an administrative proceeding may be very useful to a court in sharpening the issues, limiting what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.406" offset="4676014">And that certainly is, we're arguing, we take the position, is the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.080" offset="4702763">Again, the central point that we would make is that the lower courts here became focused in on the mandatory issue, and our position is that the statute does not say any mandatory proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.003" offset="4790430">It says any proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.405" offset="4796073">The fact that a proceeding is mandatory, it must be followed, certainly makes it reasonable to follow it, but it doesn't follow the other way, that just because something need not be done it is not reasonable to do it and therefore compensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.274" offset="4851452">And as a matter of policy, to essentially penalize someone for attempting to enforce his rights before going to federal court would simply mean an increase in cases filed in federal courts and a much longer time spent in federal court than if this type of time were compensated for.</text>

            <text syncTime="1214.586" offset="4980706">The Respondents would contend, in opposition to Petitioner's assertion, that the issue in this case is not whether the time spent in the administrative proceeding can be excluded, but whether Congress intended to include within the purview of Section 1988, intended to sanction an award of fees for optional state administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.855" offset="5089793">And we contend that when the language of the statute and the legislative history and the purposes behind Section 1988, as well as the substantive civil rights statutes for which fees are properly awardable, are considered, that this Court should affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.289" offset="5179550">In this case, as we understand it, Petitioner has essentially advanced two arguments in support of his proposition that fees are properly awardable for optional state administrative proceedings under Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.420" offset="5244125">First, the Petitioner contends... and this is what I call his reasonableness argument... that he filed an action in the federal court, he prevailed in settlement of the action, and therefore the only question left for resolution by the courts is whether time was reasonably spent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.981" offset="5318313">If so, Petitioner contends Hensley versus Eckerhart compels an award of fees in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.888" offset="5349973">We say that this argument basically fails for two different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.960" offset="5370244">In effect, what the Petitioner is requesting this Court to do is to view the state administrative proceedings and the federal district court proceedings as one unit of litigation, when in reality there are two independent legal procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.982" offset="5874303">And we think that the fact that the administrative action is separate from the federal civil rights action was recently noted and supported by this Court's opinion in Burnett versus Grattan, where this Court noted that the causes of action which Congress created in the federal civil rights acts are independent of other legal or administrative relief which may be otherwise available under state or federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.905" offset="6010035">So therefore, we think that the Petitioner's argument which seeks to view this as one unit of litigation ignores this fundamental distinction of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.120" offset="6050891">Second and probably more importantly, Petitioner's argument jumps over the very statutory threshold issue which we view as presented by this case, and that statutory threshold issue is whether the optional state administrative proceedings were actions or proceedings, if you will, as that term is used in Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.549" offset="6152559">And we think that this Court's decision in Hensley versus Eckerhart, read together with this Court's decision in Carey, established that you have... that a prevailing party has to overcome the statutory threshold before you ever get to the question of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.800" offset="6229568">And we contend that New York Gaslight Club against Carey, where the issue is can you get fee for state administrative proceedings, establishes that the issue for determination before anything else is determined by the Court is whether those proceedings are actions or proceedings within the purview of the federal civil rights attorneys' fee act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.184" offset="6315145">And we think that Petitioner's argument that seeks to jump over to the question of reasonableness ignores this very statutory threshold question which this Court established in New York Gaslight Club against Carey.</text>

            <text syncTime="1734.836" offset="7061725">The only thing I think that the Dyer County Board of Education was empowered to do under Tennessee statute is merely to reinstate Mr. Webb and to give him back pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="1865.783" offset="7585532">I don't think there was specific objection to the argument of counsel concerning constitutional claim, and I'm not sure that there is a way to divide the evidence that Petitioner submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.634" offset="7648957">But in any event, you do run into this problem, I think, of the fact that the relief sought in the federal court simply could not have been granted by the Dyer County Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.351" offset="7699844">I don't think Petitioner would contend that there's any way that the County Board of Education could render a million dollar damage verdict, nor could it certify a class action which was sought in the instant case to vindicate the rights of all black children, all black educators within the Dyer County Board of Education, within that school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.984" offset="7774345">So we think the Petitioner has simply not crossed that statutory threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.987" offset="7798378">Petitioner's argument in the alternative appears to be that the word "proceeding", which we view as the scope or threshold issue, can be construed to mean an optional state administrative proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.165" offset="7851041">And Petitioner relies on this Court's decision in New York Gaslight Club against Carey for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.810" offset="7877686">We think that if you consider... that if the Court considers the way it analyzed the problem in Carey, that the opposite result should obtain in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.590" offset="7928781">In Respondents' view, we contend that the underlying rationale of New York Club against Carey was that the statute which created the right to attorneys' fees also required the Petitioner in that case... or the Respondent in that case... to exhaust the state administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.492" offset="8016344">And the underlying thought behind that was, if you do not award fees for these proceedings which the statute requires the party to undergo, then the party may decide, if he has to pay his own attorney, he might not advance what would ultimately be a meritorious civil rights claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.167" offset="8099100">In this case those considerations simply are not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.590" offset="8116758">As I think the Petitioner has conceded, there is simply no exhaustion requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.503" offset="8140373">There is simply no part of the costs that federal law requires Petitioner to undergo in this case in order to vindicate his rights that was done in the Dyer County Board of Education hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.874" offset="8201917">We would also contend that this Court's observation in footnote 14 of Smith versus Robinson, recently decided by this Court, supports this application of Carey in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.913" offset="8258029">In that case the Court... and this was cited in our supplemental brief... this Court drew that very distinction of Carey and Title VII on the one hand and Section 1988 and a 1983 claim which was not required to be exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.795" offset="8329604">And the Court's conclusion in that case was that, since there was nothing in federal law that required the plaintiff in that case to pursue the administrative remedies, then he could have, just as Petitioner could have in this case, gone straight to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.787" offset="8401597">And we contend that the New York Gaslight Club against Carey case, as most recently applied in Smith versus Robinson, supports the Respondents' argument that Congress did not intend fees to be awarded under Section 1988 for optional state administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.487" offset="8472337">Further, as to the legislative history, this Court observed in Hensley versus Ekerhart, the very case upon which the Petitioner relies, that the very purpose of Section 1988 is to ensure effective access to the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.609" offset="8548824">And we contend that this evidences this Court's recognition that the civil rights that are set forth in Section 1988 are to be enforced primarily in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.861" offset="8605875">Patsy has held that Congress has not encouraged the use of state administrative remedies for the enforcement of these rights, and therefore this Court should deny fees for optional state administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.277" offset="8655508">We would also emphasize that to leave lower courts with no better guidance than what is reasonable to do in situations such as these will further spawn litigation, because these courts will be making judgments concerning proceedings that do not occur before them, as to the amount of hours, the monetary service... the monetary value of the services, and the impact of those proceedings on federal court litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.849" offset="8781836">And the courts may have very familiarity with these procedures and the procedures do not occur under the auspices or the control of the courts, and in our view we think that this will spawn further litigation as to what is reasonable in these particular cases, and it will take up already crowded trial and appellate docket time to litigate questions that are only peripherally related to the vindication of the underlying civil rights act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2198.720" offset="8917255">On the other hand, as Justice Blackmun points out, the costs of not at least permitting the courts to consider the preparation time is to provide a disincentive to follow alternative remedies and stay out of court altogether.</text>

            <text syncTime="2216.411" offset="8987994">Now, of course, there's no... and there may be some of that disincentive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.875" offset="9009937">But there's no clear indication, at least from the Court's opinion in Patsy, that administrative remedies provide the swiftest or most accurate way to resolve these disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.494" offset="9052360">And as I've also pointed out, the relief that's granted at the administrative level may not be coextensive with the rights that are sought to be protected by the Petitioner, as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.461" offset="9100216">So that even had Petitioner prevailed in this case, he still might have wound up in federal court on his damage to reputation claims and damage claims, as well as injunctive class relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.788" offset="9149535">So we think that that proposition cuts both ways in this case in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.524" offset="9172523">And in view of the increased litigation over this question of reasonableness, we think the balance should be struck the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.728" offset="9201362">And on balance, we would assert in the Respondents' view that denial of fees for optional state administrative proceedings in this case would indeed provide lower courts and counsel with a clear line of demarcation and a bright line of demarcation to determine what services are compensable under Section 1988 and what services, if the Petitioner chooses to pursue those remedies, for which he must bear his own counsel fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.387" offset="9327900">If there are no further questions, I'd like to thank the Court for its attention.</text>

            <text syncTime="2312.647" offset="9373039">I have a very few responses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.889" offset="9385996">With regard to what went on in the administrative process and what was sought in district court, it is true that broader relief was initially sought in district court, but the case was actually settled based on exactly what the school board could have granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.009" offset="9446391">That is, the back pay plus in this case, since Mr. Webb had gotten another job, not reinstatement but the wiping out, expungement of his record and allowing to change a dismissal to a resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.237" offset="9507309">Indeed, if one looks at the transcript of the hearings before the school board, it reads remarkably like a proceeding to vindicate a racial discrimination claim, a claim of racial discrimination in employment in an individual discrimination claim brought under Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.351" offset="9591841">For that reason, the work that was done clearly was relevant to the federal claims, and clearly we believe aided in the ultimate resolution of this case through settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.599" offset="9636771">With regard to whether our rule that we request would open up further litigation over what is reasonable, again, the district courts on a daily basis, dealing with counsel fee applications, deal with whether some particular time spent was reasonable, with regard to whether it was necessary to spend so much time taking depositions, which are not done before the court, whether discovery was reasonable, whether other activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.035" offset="9738544">If the defendant objects to time as being too much, being unreasonable, then the district courts have found themselves perfectly capable of dealing with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.530" offset="9776474">And frankly, I don't see anything inherently more difficult in dealing with looking at an administrative proceeding such as was gone through here and deciding whether or not what was done was reasonable in terms of attempting to enforce federal civil rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2467.647" offset="9992977">I mean, it depends on the circumstances, just as if the case had gone straight into federal court the district court might decide that someone spent 20 hours researching a memo and they could have done it in two hours or it wasn't necessary really to do it at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2480.416" offset="10044073">It's hard to get the flavor of it, but as I read the district court opinion I thought he was treating the claim as though the lawyer who was then representing the plaintiff thought he was entitled as a matter of law to be compensated for the time in that proceeding more or less as he is in the federal proceeding.</text>
