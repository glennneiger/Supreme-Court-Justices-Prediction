            <text syncTime="84.504" offset="464763">An effluent limitation is simply a figure that tells a facility how much of a particular pollutant it is permitted to discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.093" offset="499140">These are usually expressed in pounds or kilos of pollutants per 1,000 pounds of product.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.580" offset="525158">For example, one pound of pollutant per 1,000 pounds of steel, plastic, or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.269" offset="551907">There are separate sets of effluent limitations for what are known as direct dischargers, facilities that discharge their wastes directly into the navigable waters, and indirect dischargers, facilities that discharge into public treatment works.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.612" offset="617214">This case concerns indirect dischargers, but the basic arguments are the same in both the direct and indirect discharger contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.235" offset="655770">Direct dischargers were required to meet two sets of effluent limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.389" offset="676355">By 1977, they were required to meet the effluent limitations associated with what is known as BPT, the best practicable control technology currently available, and between 1984 and 1987, depending on the type of pollutant, they are required to satisfy the stricter standards of what is known as the AT, the best available technology economically achievable.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.808" offset="794010">Indirect dischargers have similar requirements called pre-treatment standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.545" offset="816998">Effluent limitations are set on what is known as a categorical basis, that is by industrial category and subcategory.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.651" offset="857436">EPA has identified those categories of industry where pollution control is most urgently needed, and it has taken the larger categories and further sliced them into numerous subcategories, some fairly broad and some quite narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.843" offset="918144">In fact, some of these subcategories have included as few as one or two facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.730" offset="941759">The Clean Water Act itself does not set any of these effluent limitations or standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.484" offset="964747">That is EPA's job using factors that are generally set out in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.705" offset="985645">For example, some of the factors that are used for BAT and for pre-treatment include the age of facilities and equipment involved, the energy requirements of different types of pollution control technology, the different manufacturing processes that may be used, and the cost of achieving effluent reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.868" offset="1070281">Let me give an example using the factor of cost to which I may return later in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.439" offset="1092538">EPA may determine that for a particular subcategory there is a new advanced form of pollution control technology that will cost between, let's say, between three-quarters of a million and one million dollars per facility to install, and EPA may find that a cost of one million dollars per plant is economically achievable, so EPA may conclude that for this subcategory, this technology represents BAT.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.257" offset="1199849">It is the best available technology economically achievable.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.577" offset="1221060">Gathering information on all of the relevant factors in making these determinations for all of these categories and all of these subcategories is an enormous task.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.218" offset="1267663">Just in the indirect discharger category there are more than 30... there are more than 60,000 facilities in the 34 primary industrial categories, and EPA was supposed to go about this work at a really breathtaking pace.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.894" offset="1334327">Under the Act, EPA was given 180 days to proposed the pre-treatment standards for all of American industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.767" offset="1365883">EPA has not been able to meet these impossible deadlines and as a result Respondent has had law suits pending against the Agency for the past decade, seeking to compel the Agency to move more quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.343" offset="1424188">EPA's only hope of issuing effluent limitations on a reasonably expeditious basis has been to concentrate on the typical plants during the rulemaking phase, and not on the atypical ones, and consequently one of EPA's problems has been these unusual plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.055" offset="1499003">These may be older.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.340" offset="1504123">They may use different manufacturing processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.209" offset="1515617">Their energy costs may be different because of location, or some other factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.094" offset="1535156">Let me return to my example where BAT was calculated to cost between three-quarter of a million and a million dollars for a facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.718" offset="1573713">For one of these unusual plants, the cost may be two million dollars, far beyond what is economically achievable for any of the facilities in that subcategory.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.574" offset="1617076">How is EPA supposed to deal with this problem of the unusual plant?</text>
            <text syncTime="377.811" offset="1638079">One solution, and this is one that Respondent recommends in his brief, would be for EPA simply to withhold issuing its categorical limitations until it has tracked down every single facility and every single subcategory of the category under consideration, and has determined that... what the requirements and factors are for that facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.926" offset="1726477">This may be theoretically possible, but it would certainly delay the issuance of the categorical limitations and that would not serve the purposes of the Clean Water Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.256" offset="2659780">When you're dealing with variances, the FDF variances outside of the toxic area, just in the regular area, what is the statutory source of the Agency's authority to grant such variances?</text>

            <text syncTime="646.665" offset="2713488">I think it stems from 501 which authorizes the Agency to issue regulations necessary to implement the Act, and I think it stems from two potentially conflicting statutory commands in the Clean Water Act, namely, to issue these limitations on a categorical basis, and then to do it based on factors that vary significantly among seemingly similar plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.797" offset="2814007">There is tension between these two statutory commands, and the FDF variance mechanism, I think, is a permissible way of reconciling that.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.053" offset="2847026">I think in the DuPont case, this Court recognized that the FDF variance was an appropriate and perhaps even a necessary mechanism in the BPT context, and I see no reason to draw a distinction between BPT and and BAT in pre-treatment in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.233" offset="2927692">The statutory authority is the same, and EPA's practical problem is the same: How do you issue defensible categorical regulations on a reasonably expeditious basis, while taking into account factors that may vary greatly from plant to plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="921.259" offset="3811780">that plant is ineligible for an FDF variance because it would not have shown that the Agency did not consider the proper range of factors, only that the individual plant was economically weak and could not afford compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.185" offset="3867578">I think that is the distinction Congress drew in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.470" offset="3884714">What the statutory modifications do is not to correct an incorrect effluent limitation, they excuse compliance with a proper limitation based on factors such as the weak economic condition of a particular plant, because under certain circumstances, those factors take precedence, but Congress said, when it comes to toxic pollutants, these other factors must take a backseat.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.638" offset="3993383">That is the distinction Congress drew, and that is the reason why we think Congress limited 301(l) to the statutory modifications and not to FDF variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.714" offset="4041658">The FDF variance has been a device that EPA has used to deal with this problem of the unusual, and it has worked very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.051" offset="4074990">It has allowed the agency to issue its regulations more quickly than would otherwise have been possible if it had to stop and worry about every unusual facility in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.843" offset="4118144">It has helped the agency to defend against court challenges to those regulations by facilities claiming to be fundamentally different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.299" offset="4155970">It has been specifically cited by several courts of appeal in turning away those challenges, and it has not been necessary to use this safety device very often, which speaks, I think, to the accuracy of the effluent limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.458" offset="4216574">The issue in this case, of course, is the meaning of 301(l), which prohibits modifications of effluent limitations for toxic pollutants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.016" offset="4254817">As I said, EPA's position has always been that this is limited exclusively to statutory modifications under 301(c) and (g).</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.288" offset="4295986">Respondent says that it is contrary to the plain language of 301(l).</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.958" offset="4314585">Respondent says that a modification is any change in an effluent limitation that makes the effluent limitation more lenient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.047" offset="4350947">But if that interpretation were correct, then what would happen if EPA issued an effluent limitation for a toxic pollutant and then discovered that its analysis was mistaken, or circumstances changed, energy costs skyrocketed for example, and a technology that was previously economically achievable became unaffordable?</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.580" offset="4449063">Under that plain meaning argument, EPA would be powerless to amend its own rules, and that can't be what Congress intended.</text>

            <text syncTime="1145.022" offset="4706840">In the Senate, however, in the Senate bill, there was not a separate provision like 301(l).</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.109" offset="4735261">301(c) was amended to include the prohibition against that particular type of modification for toxic pollutant, and similarly there was a prohibition in 301(g) which was a new provision prohibiting that type of modification for a toxic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.220" offset="4803702">What the conference committee did was to take this language out of 301(c) and (g) and create a new section 301(l).</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.743" offset="4837765">When they did that, they did not provide any notice to their colleagues that they were expanding the substance of each of those provisions, and they provided no explanation for the change which suggests to us that the change was intended to be purely stylistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.920" offset="4898474">There is also what Congress said about 301(l), and admittedly it did not say very much, but almost every time it referred to it, it was specifically linked with 301(c) and (g).</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.846" offset="4954167">There is also the inference that we believe may fairly be drawn from what Congress did not say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.547" offset="4972975">At no point in the legislative history of 301(l) did any Member of Congress suggest that 301(l) was intended to reach EPA's well-established and well-known practice of granting FDF variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.723" offset="5033684">If any Member of Congress had had such an intent, we believe that they would have said something, but nobody did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.013" offset="5062836">Respondent says, Congress was not aware of the fact that EPA had been issuing FDF variances, but that is incorrect for at least two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.685" offset="5097527">First of all, EPA had been including FDF variance provisions in its BPT regulations for some time, and I think this was well known in the environmental community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.259" offset="5147787">Respondent says that Congress was not worried about BPT in 1977, it had put it out of its mind, but BPT was going to remain in effect for seven more years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1291.500" offset="5292819">No, but that is because the way that toxic pollutants were handled under the Clean Water Act was radically changed in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.355" offset="5328241">Before 1977, I believe they were supposed to be dealt with primarily under Section 307, which is a separate set of effluent limitations for toxic pollutants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.829" offset="5370141">Then in 1977, it was decided that they would be dealt with primarily through the regular technology-based effluent limitations that are issued under 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.804" offset="5417997">Those effluent limitations had been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.756" offset="5433775">There had been FDF variances from those limitations for pollutants that were later designated as toxic pollutants, and the pollutants to which 301(l) applies are those on a list that was included in a consent degree between NRDC and the Government prior to the 1977 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.704" offset="5525622">It is now referred to in Section 307 of the Act, and those pollutants, there are 65 of them, are set out in a provision of the Code of Federal Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.596" offset="5577135">Returning to my argument that Respondent maintains that Congress was not aware of EPA's practice of granting FDF variances, I think the thing that really refutes that argument is this Court's decision in DuPont, which occurred in early 1977, and the Clear Water Act was enacted in late 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.859" offset="5662190">DuPont referred prominently to FDF variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.913" offset="5678490">This was pivotal case under the Act, and I think the Members of Congress, and surely the congressional staff members who were concerned with the Clean Water Act Amendments of 1977 must have been aware of the FDF variance mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.339" offset="5740139">If anybody had any intent of restricting EPA's practice of granting those FDF variances, I think someone would have said something but, as I mentioned, no one did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.397" offset="5784339">It is also important to realize that granting an FDF variance for a toxic pollutant is completely consistent with Congress's intent in 1977 to take strong measures against toxic pollutants because, as I said, all an FDF variance does is to correct a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.060" offset="5866990">It just establishes the kind of effluent limitation that should have been set in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1472.333" offset="6016097">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.352" offset="6028218">The issue here is a very straightforward one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.356" offset="6048175">Can EPA grant variances from national pre-treatment standards for toxic pollutants?</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.279" offset="6079940">Congress amended the Clean Water Act in 1977 to strengthen EPA's ability to regulate toxics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.234" offset="6115676">it identified BAT and pre-treatment standards as the key elements of a toxic control strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.156" offset="6151411">It carefully considered when and under what conditions EPA could grant variances from these standards, and each time it considered the idea of a variance for toxics, it rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.916" offset="6206477">At the same time, Congress enacted 301(1) of the law, which tells EPA in broad and unqualified language not to modify any BAT for pre-treatment standard for toxics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.860" offset="6266245">EPA urges this Court to take a very narrow reading of 301(l).</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.829" offset="6290069">EPA says that the broad ban on variances in that section was intended to apply to the statutory variances from BAT that Congress had created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.053" offset="6343045">In other words, the economic capability variance in Section 301(c) of the law, or the water quality variance in Section 301(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.694" offset="6385573">Congress, says EPA, did not mean to cut off any implied authority that EPA might have at some future time to creates administrative variances from BAT for pre-treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.252" offset="6431757">Of course, if Congress had this very narrow purpose in mind, it would have had no reason to create 301(l).</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.941" offset="6470523">Both 301(c) and what became 301(g) in the Senate bill already contained provisos limiting their applicability to non-toxics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.551" offset="6529037">EPA says that when the conference moved the ban on variances out of Section 301(c) and into a separate subsection, it did so for purely stylistic reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.258" offset="6579819">Not substitute change was intended, it simply reflected the drafters' desire to put the words in the statute somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.781" offset="6609912">But EPA's analysis is plainly wrong, because Congress did not simply move the words, it changed them to reaffirm the intent that we maintain here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.589" offset="6661112">The original ban on variances had said, don't modify any requirement of 301(b)(2)(A), in other words, don't modify a BAT or pre-treatment standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.079" offset="6711059">The new subsection (1) said, don't modify any requirement of 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.050" offset="6734987">It included within its scope not only pre-treatment and BAT standards, but the more stringent toxic effluent standards that were not technology based.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.572" offset="6773125">In addition, Congress moved subsection (1) out of the sections of the conference bill that were entitled "waivers", or "modifications", and into a section of the conference bill that was entitled "Toxic Pollutants".</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.201" offset="6839581">The latter section identified for the first time the toxics of concern to Congress, and told EPA to regulate those quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.608" offset="6885243">In other words, Congress deliberately wrote 301(l) as a comprehensive ban on variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.281" offset="6915963">It wanted to curtail all variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.916" offset="6934458">It did not simply mean to plus the loophole that had been created in 301(c) and 301(g) of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.522" offset="6968835">Ignoring this evolution of 301(l), EPA argues, that if Congress wanted to cut off other variances, it must have believed that there were such other variances, and if so, it is odd that Congress didn't mention them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.031" offset="7026931">So EPA searches for legislative history to reference the FDF.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.566" offset="7045008">In coming up empty-handed, it says, that search is dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.435" offset="7060577">This analysis begs the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.172" offset="7075519">The broad language of 301(l) prohibits all variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.291" offset="7095999">It isn't necessary for Congress to have had the FDF variance in mind to curtail it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2212.810" offset="8978069">The questions that you ask in a BPT variance proceeding, as opposed to in a 301(c) variance, are different because BPT and BAT are different.</text>

            <text syncTime="2278.855" offset="9242219">One very critical difference is that a revision afterwards takes place in the context of a statutory compliance deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.425" offset="9272521">Congress said that sources had only three years from the date the standards were issued to come into compliance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2302.387" offset="9336365">There is no mechanism to tailor these standards to individual plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.439" offset="9352561">Sources don't have the luxury of waiting for that permit, they must comply automatically with that standard once it is issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.295" offset="9384012">The FDF variance is anti-factidal to that statutory scheme because it takes EPA seven or eight years to decide these variance applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.218" offset="9427689">If it takes seven or eight years, you can't meet a three year compliance deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.739" offset="9457782">Also during the rulemaking, EPA cannot categorize sources on the basis of cost, the way it purports to do in an FDF variance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2351.801" offset="9533955">Congress anticipated that, and it was envisioned in BAT that that would happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.205" offset="9555584">If you could subcategorize on the basis of cost, you wouldn't need a 301(c) variance, you wouldn't need reference in the legislative history to fact that sources might close, or that everyone had to come up to the level of the best performer because the subcategorization would take care of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.268" offset="9631862">EPA cannot subcategorize on the basis of cost as the FDF variance would allow it to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2389.910" offset="9686405">The new sources standards in the Act are not subject to variances as this Court held in DuPont.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.766" offset="9717857">Those standards can be revised from time to time to reflect new developments in technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.586" offset="9741158">In fact, Congress used the same language to tell EPA to revise new source standards as it did to tell EPA to revise the pre-treatment standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.958" offset="9782641">So the ability of EPA to revise the standards does not in any way interfere or conflict with their duty to prevent case by case decision-making, plant by plant tailoring of the standards to individual sources, especially after the rulemaking, when the compliance set time is running.</text>

            <text syncTime="2502.333" offset="10136130">EPA says, those statements were made in the context of 301(c) or 301(g) of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2509.939" offset="10166536">The statement that I quoted from Congressman Roberts discusses Section 53 of the conference bill, which contains 301(l).</text>

            <text syncTime="2540.141" offset="10287326">In 1977, EPA had a well established practice of drawing a distinction between the BPT standards on the one hand for which it had FDF variances, and the BAT and pre-treatment standards for which it did not have such variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.336" offset="10356185">So EPA's analysis of the legislative history hinges on a single word, when Congressman Roberts said, in another statement,</text>

            <text syncTime="2573.779" offset="10421909">EPA hinges on that word "specifically", and said that is a word of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.868" offset="10446255">In context, it is more appropriately viewed as an example of the types of variances that Congress was prohibiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.205" offset="10479587">EPA's argument is not based on support in the legislative history, it is based on silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.545" offset="10504979">That argument is hardly sufficient to overcome a statutory provision which tells you not to modify BAT on pre-treatment standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="2621.695" offset="10613543">When it reexamined BAT in 1977, it considered the fact that these standards might be viewed by the courts as not sufficiently flexible, and they created 301(g) for that purpose, but it said, that is not available for toxics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.372" offset="10672267">When it examined pre-treatment, it considered the problem of people who could not meet the standards and said, the answer to that is to let the municipality do the controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.561" offset="10716988">It carefully circumscribed each opportunity to create a variance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.815" offset="10738095">It inconceivable that Congress would have gone to that detail if, as EPA maintains, it intended to leave open the question of what variances could be given, and what could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.391" offset="10788355">Indeed, this Court has said, where Congress considers exceptions to a statute, non-statutory exceptions are not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.580" offset="10825135">This case is not simply an extension of DuPont, as if Congress did nothing in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.234" offset="10855751">In fact, if Congress read DuPont the way EPA does, so that DuPont authorized variances from BAT and pre-treatment, it is strange that Congress would not have said, in enacting its subsection (1), we want to be very clear here to draw a distinction to say that this is not intended to rule out FDF variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.349" offset="10944149">Congress didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.551" offset="10960972">This Court in DuPont said that variances were not available from new source standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="2725.180" offset="11027532">301(c) and (g) that are applicable to BAT standards are not available in the context of indirect dischargers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2737.587" offset="11077165">There is no permit mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.689" offset="11085524">The deadlines here are very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.141" offset="11095346">Congress told EPA to set the pre-treatment standards more quickly than it told EPA to set the BAT and BPT limits, and it gave sources only three years, as opposed to a 1977 or 1974 deadline for meeting pre-treatment... excuse me, for meeting BPT or BAT.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.269" offset="11175907">That makes sense when you consider that pre-treatment is a program with several goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.107" offset="11199209">It is not simply to protect water quality, it is also a program to protect the integrity of a capital investment in pollution control equipment, the pollution control equipment at the municipal sewage treatment plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.199" offset="11255633">Pre-treatment standards are to prevent industries from discharging toxics that could interfere with the operation of that sewage treatment plant, or that could contaminate large volumes of municipal sludge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3176.934" offset="12834579">One other argument that EPA makes is that this variance is necessary to the rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.207" offset="12867597">It is necessary either for information that EPA doesn't get in a rulemaking, or for information that it can't consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.460" offset="12896645">That argument does not withstand analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.645" offset="12909393">Section 308 of the law gives EPA ample authority to require, during the rulemaking, all the information that is relevant to the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.870" offset="12958294">The record suggests that EPA should be making more use of 308, and less use of FDF variance mechanism, because EPA says, we sent questionnaires to 500 electroplates and only 200 of whom responded with some of the information that we requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.230" offset="13019734">If those sources failed to bring the information to EPA's attention during a rulemaking, there is no reason to give them a second bite of the apple, to challenge the standard after the rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.972" offset="13070725">Likewise, EPA has data that it doesn't consider during the rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.376" offset="13092250">There is no reason to sanction EPA's failure to consider that data.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.411" offset="13108446">In fact, its rules might be vulnerable.</text>
