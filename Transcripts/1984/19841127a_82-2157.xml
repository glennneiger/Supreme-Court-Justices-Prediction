            <text syncTime="95.274" offset="524866">The issue in this case before this Court is whether in conducting these audits the trustees may request access to records beyond those of employees for whom the employer admits liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.626" offset="574290">It is the trustees' claim that they have a right to a more comprehensive audit in this context under their trust agreement and under the prudent manual of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.872" offset="619221">The Sixth Circuit, in reversing the District Court, limited the trustees' audit rights to records of those employees that the employer admitted were covered and only to those unless the trustees could show cause why a particular employee was omitted, in which case that person, the particular employee's records could then be audited.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.911" offset="711381">The petitioners are health and welfare and pension funds located in Chicago.</text>

            <text syncTime="151.453" offset="749519">They have over half a million participants and beneficiaries with over 12,000 employers, and there are thousands of collective bargaining agreements that apply to the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.808" offset="794972">The respondent, Central Transport, is 16 companies engaged in trucking and related industries, all parties to a collective bargaining agreement commonly referred to as the National Master Freight Agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.553" offset="853905">Under the collective bargaining agreement, the Transport obligation is to remit contributions under the collective bargaining agreement on each employee who's performing work under the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.781" offset="902910">The fund's obligation, the petitioners' obligations on the pension plan, which is related to... which is governed by the ERISA in its trust agreement, is to give credits or benefits to persons on the basis of covered employment for pensions as a matter of law if they perform work covered by the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.318" offset="1001026">And this is the case regardless of whether or not the employer defaults on his contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.160" offset="1020357">The funds, of necessity because of their scope, operate on a self-reporting system which we refer to as an honor system.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.390" offset="1057346">The way it works simply is that the employer sends to the fund each month a list of the employees that the employer says are covered by the collective bargaining agreement, and he sends along a check for that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.056" offset="1115965">The trustees, who are familiar with misreporting problems in a multi-employer setting, have enacted a trust agreement that this Court looked at in February of this year in Prosser and Schneider.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.970" offset="1179599">And in that trust agreement, the trustees provided for an audit provision that provided in Article 3, Section 5, that the trustees shall be empowered to conduct on site audits of pertinent records of a contributing employer to verify for the accuracy of the reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.431" offset="1269461">In implementing that program, the trustees conduct random audits.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.788" offset="1294852">In this particular case, in 1980 the funds sought to conduct a random audit of Central Transport.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.596" offset="1326094">The auditors, upon arriving, or shortly thereafter, at Central Transport, were told by the officials of Central Transport that 60 percent of the employees of Central Transport, which was engaged primarily in the trucking industry, were not covered by the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.649" offset="1410313">The company then refused to produce any documentation to the fund's representatives to produce or to support its contention that these 60 percent of the employees were not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.707" offset="1454616">As to the records that they allowed us to audit, those of employees that they admitted they owed liability on, the fund determined that there were over $268,000 in audit findings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1926.335" offset="7849079">The complement of employers... of employees, rather, that Central Transport has is made up of three broad categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.582" offset="7882097">The first are those who are members of the Teamsters Union who operate within the jurisdiction of the Central States fund and are participants in that fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="1964.819" offset="8002992">And finally, there are those employees who are not members of any union who can qualify, if they meet the definition of ERISA participant, to be a participant in the employer-sponsored pension fund that is maintained by Central Transport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.466" offset="8069656">Justice O'Connor asked a question earlier, followed up by Mr. Justice Brennan: Must a person be a member of the union to be a participant in these funds?</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.680" offset="8118453">And I think the answer was given that no, these funds represent a broad spectrum of participants, and not all participants have to be members of the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="3209.447" offset="12981513">We admit that ERISA's definition of employee is much broader than... excuse me... than the definition in the collective bargaining agreement, and it's meant to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.737" offset="13022682">If the Court finds that these trustees and all Taft-Hartley trustees have a power that's found in the law, some place in the law, although ERISA does not expressly give it to them, then they've had it at least since 1975... not since they've concocted their theory, because ERISA's fiduciary standards became active in 1975, and before that... these are Taft-Hartley funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.088" offset="13132083">Taft-Hartley's been around since 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.397" offset="13141278">And isn't it strange that in 1947's hearings in Congress, in 1974's hearings for the ERISA, in the hearings for the Welfare Pension Plan Disclosure Act that preceded ERISA, and in the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act in 1980, Congress never said these trustees have the power they say Congress intended?</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.690" offset="13214525">I would think that a more reasonable resolution of that puzzlement is that Congress simply did not intend to give them this power.</text>

            <text syncTime="3590.196" offset="14504556">--Yes, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.759" offset="14510825">Your Honor, there was a couple of things that I would like to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.677" offset="14530470">Number one, the bottom line is the Transport is saying you have to take our word for it, absent reasonable cause, because that's what the Sixth Circuit said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.922" offset="14595462">The adequate protections that you have is the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.732" offset="14610718">Well, as this Court examined in Prosser and Schneider, the union may not be reliable in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.431" offset="14637467">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.884" offset="14639243">Because the buck doesn't stop with them; it stops with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.649" offset="14650319">And the fact of the matter is that our interests do not always converge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.648" offset="14666306">We have fiduciary responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.802" offset="14682920">They don't have any responsibility to retirees and their families; we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.440" offset="14697549">And as I said at the top of my argument, that under ERISA and under the law as interpreted by the Department of Labor, that if an employee performs work in a collective bargaining agreement, the fund is liable to provide him with pension credits regardless of whether or not that employer ever paid us a nickel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.354" offset="14789186">Now, Congress made us the fiduciaries and gave us the responsibility to maintain, preserve and protect the assets of that fund, and we submit to this Court that not only ERISA but our trust agreements does not require us to simply take someone's word for it.</text>
