            <text syncTime="23.180" offset="221443">The question here involves the power of the Internal Revenue Service to levy on a joint bank account where only one of the co-depositors is indebted to the IRS for unpaid taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.106" offset="273166">The delinquent taxpayer here is one Roy Reeves, who owes the IRS about $800.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.093" offset="301065">Roy has a checking account and a savings account at the Respondent bank, titled jointly in his name and the name of Ruby and Neva Reeves, who we understand to be Roy's mother and wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.437" offset="362505">These bank accounts are typical of joint bank accounts in most jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.656" offset="383298">That is, each depositor is entitled to withdraw any amount up to the full outstanding balance from the account, without notice to his co-depositors.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.778" offset="427811">The bank likewise is required to honor any withdrawal request that Roy might make, again up to the full outstanding balance, absent written instructions from the other depositors not to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.954" offset="488519">Arkansas law also provides that the bank's payment to any one depositor immunizes it from claims by the other depositors to the money thus paid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.064" offset="540973">In short, as the Court of Appeals correctly stated, at the time the bank received the notice of levy Roy could have withdrawn any amount he wished from these joint accounts and used it to pay his federal tax bill, and his co-depositors would have had no lawful claim against the bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="134.502" offset="666674">But that in our view does not negate the fact that Roy had a right to property that the IRS could levy on.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.422" offset="698439">Our position is simply that whatever Roy could do with respect to the account unilaterally, the IRS can do by virtue of its levy power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.439" offset="6014462">And the Court clearly held that the right to compel payment of a sum to one is a right to property, and therefore, because the insured during his life could have compelled the insurance company to pay him the cash surrender value, we could levy on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.098" offset="6077052">Now, I should point out that in that situation other people could very well be prejudiced, because if we levied on the cash surrender value and got all the cash out the policy would be at an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.006" offset="6124699">The beneficiaries of the life insurance policy would get no proceeds if that person thereafter died.</text>

            <text syncTime="2320.811" offset="9411948">And that was also recognized by the district court and the Eighth Circuit in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.282" offset="9437861">Those are the only things we do know at this point, is that Roy Reeves is named along with Ruby and Neva on two joint accounts, a savings account and a checking account.</text>

            <text syncTime="2349.897" offset="9528245">That was the analysis that the Eighth Circuit used in looking at whether there was a state-created property right which is required by the decisions of this Court, and the Eighth Circuit correctly concluded that there has been no establishment of any state property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.859" offset="9604105">The Government has failed to provide us enough evidence or information to determine whether there exists any property or right to property, and that's their burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.131" offset="9645274">The Eighth Circuit then correctly found itself to be in accord with Stock Yards Bank, which was a very similar situation dealing with savings bonds instead of a joint bank account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.157" offset="9701385">But in Stock Yards Bank the savings bonds were held in joint names of husband and wife, and the federal regulations applicable to them said that invests no title, that you have to look to the agreement of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.465" offset="9750599">It's identical to Arkansas law in that concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.333" offset="9766064">And in Stock Yards Bank the Sixth Circuit found that the simple fact of joint title did not determine any property interests or rights to property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.975" offset="9812562">So we have two circuits in accord at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.092" offset="9825101">As the Eighth Circuit noted, its decision is not going to be in conflict with any other circuits, and it specifically reviewed decisions of the Second, Fifth, and Ninth Circuits, which the Government, by the way, submits are in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.536" offset="9886854">But the Second Circuit case of U.S. versus Sterling National was an offset case.</text>
