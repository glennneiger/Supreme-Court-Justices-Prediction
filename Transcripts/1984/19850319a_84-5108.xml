            <label>Mr. William Thomas Huyck</label>
            <text syncTime="11.269" offset="188970">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.071" offset="200151">This case presents the Court with a question of interpretation of the language of a federal criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.494" offset="229826">The statute at issue, Section 2024(b) of Title VII is one of a common type of criminal statute appended to a statute of Congress establishing a program... in this case the food stamp program... and providing for criminal prosecution for fraud, and stating in relevant part that whoever knowingly acquires food stamps in any manner not authorized by this chapter is guilty of an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.545" offset="350093">And the issue that's presented as to the wording of this statute is, taking the phrase, again in relevant part, acquires coupons in any manner not authorized by the chapter, since Congress has chosen to use the word "knowingly", does the word "knowingly" apply to that entire phrase; or, as argued by the Government, does it apply to only a portion of the phrase, namely "acquires coupons"; that in other words, the offender knew he was acquiring coupons, but that he need not know it was in any manner in violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.378" offset="485408">The facts of this case can be stated very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.618" offset="498364">The petitioner and his brother ran a small sandwich shop in a poor neighborhood in Chicago which was not a member of the food stamp program.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.166" offset="532533">There was quite a bit of evidence in the record about the enforcement of the food stamp regulations against food stores and other participants in the food stamp program which in essence establishes a tremendous amount of notice and warning prior to undercover criminal investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.557" offset="602123">None of this applied to the sandwich shop that petitioner and his brother ran.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.080" offset="624170">An undercover agent with a secret tape recorder came into their sandwich shop, having gone to a food store that she was investigating, the food store having told them that they would not buy food stamps from her, and then she went to... but told her try the sandwich shop down the street, whereupon she sent into the sandwich shop, offered to sell food stamps at a discount to petitioner and his brother, and did so on three occasions, whereupon they were prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.541" offset="746005">The issue that is before this Court was raised in the jury instruction conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.144" offset="776412">The trial counsel, myself, offered a specific intent jury instruction, the standard specific intent jury instruction, that he had to be purposefully intending to violate the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.975" offset="831791">The Government objected, and the judge agreed, that this was a strict liability offense as to the element of knowledge of violating the law, and thereupon, the judge's instruction to the jury told the jury in essence there were three elements of the offense, and he divided the action element from the knowledge element.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.880" offset="927399">He said that they had to find first that the defendant acquired and possessed food stamp coupons for cash in a manner not authorized by federal statute, the act; and then he said second, they have to find the defendant knowingly and willfully acquired the food stamps, but not that it was in a manner in violation of the regulations.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="218.215" stopTime="227.881">
            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="218.215" offset="1016738">In your view did that mean the jury need only find that the defendant knew that the food stamps were food stamps and not postcards, so to speak?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_thomas_huyck" startTime="227.881" stopTime="275.562">
            <label>Mr. William Thomas Huyck</label>
            <text syncTime="227.881" offset="1055399">Yes, exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.621" offset="1062400">And that... there was a colloquy with the court, and in fact the colloquy went so far as my asking the court can I argue to the jury... my client had testified in this case that he was not familiar with the food stamp regulations, and that he did not know that it violated any regulations for him to be buying these food stamps from this undercover agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.226" offset="1148813">And this was virtually the only defense that he had other than entrapment, which was also a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.780" offset="1170965">So this took me by surprise that this was going to be interpreted not as a specific intent crime, and so there was a colloquy, and I asked the judge can I argue that to the jury, and the judge said no, you cannot argue ignorance of the law in this case to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.547" offset="1710028">This is a statute where there's a legal element that is an attendant circumstance, as you will, of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.282" offset="1736986">The definition of this offense has an element of an act, acquiring food stamps, and an element of an attendant circumstance, namely that that acquisition is not in any manner authorized by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.100" offset="1792262">And you have, I think, in the Model Penal Code a much more reasonable basis for interpreting criminal statutes of this kind than to quibble about the way that modifying language can be phrased in the English language.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.979" offset="1851821">And as I tried to make an example in my reply brief, the results should not just turn on the fortuitous way that a phrase is turned.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.668" offset="1894557">Judge Magruder in the St. Johnsbury Trucking case that I cited used the example of adulterated milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.994" offset="1923814">If you have a statute that says whoever knowingly sells adulterated milk, people would assume that that means that you have to know it was adulterated as well as knowing that it was milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.509" offset="1969894">But if you phrased it this way, "milk which had been adulterated", using a phrase instead of an adverb, an adjective, you should have the same result.</text>

            <text syncTime="943.168" offset="3916539">But in subsection (c) they don't say whoever knowingly presents food stamps for redemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="959.630" offset="3982368">Well, is it entirely accurate to equate the term "knowingly" and speak of that as a specific intent?</text>
            <text syncTime="967.985" offset="4015804">I mean an intent is something... is the intent with which you do an act, and knowingly has always struck me as something a little bit different, or either less or more inclusive than the intention.</text>

            <text syncTime="983.035" offset="4075991">Well, here again, I think that the Model Penal Code offers guidance, because the definition of "knowingly" there as to an act is different than "knowingly" as to a circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.142" offset="4120503">We're talking about a circumstance here, and I think the definition is very straightforward, that he knows that such facts exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.827" offset="4151223">And here the circumstance is that they were acquired in a manner in violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.123" offset="4180376">He knows that that fact exists, that that was the manner in which they were acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.865" offset="4199393">So I think that "knowingly" is a very accurate term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.609" offset="4218306">I think that this Court's Bailey decision, United States v. Bailey, I think has been... had a very salutory effect in eliminating in many criminal trials this same specific intent instruction that I submitted in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.749" offset="4286851">And pointing out that it would be much more useful to a jury for a judge to specifically address the mental element that is required for each specific element in the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.867" offset="4339305">And a federal judge is at a disadvantage over a state judge, and I have cited an Illinois case, the Valley Steel case, as an illustration of how much easier this job is for a judge in a state that's adopted the Model Penal Code where you can look at the rules of construction and find, if it's not expressly put in there by the legislature, find what the mental element is as to each element of the offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1131.591" offset="4670224">I think that it's a very important principle to uphold, that the jury listens particularly to the instruction of the judge, and may discard or not pay attention to the arguments of the lawyers, and look to the judge for the instruction on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.572" offset="4734172">And I think that sometimes it seems that it's harsh to reverse a criminal conviction and have a new trial because of instructions, but I think that here you certainly don't have a harmless misinstruction, if it is a misinstruction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1186.618" offset="4890384">And the colloquy makes clear that the judge was clearly trying to make that distinction in these instructions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1199.576" offset="4942211">The Government has pinned its argument very closely to this Court's decision last term in Yermian, trying to say that this statute is similar to Yermian, and the case should be decided in the same manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.985" offset="4987873">The text is different from the text, and the circumstances are different, and the case is not governed by the Yermian decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.388" offset="5025385">Yermian involved Section 1001, and you had the making of a false statement, and then the phrase</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.304" offset="5053075">"in any matter in a jurisdiction of a federal agency. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.266" offset="5064986">In that statute the phrase "in any matter" came at the beginning of the sentence before the word "knowingly".</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.251" offset="5096856">That's a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.773" offset="5103021">The previous statute, which the Court also said in a footnote also has a clear meaning that it doesn't apply to that phrase, the phrase did follow the word "knowingly", but they were separated by a comma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.312" offset="5153176">I think that... and even the statute where it came at the beginning, four members of this Court felt that it wasn't clear it was Congress' meaning that the word "knowingly" did not apply to that phrase "in any matter".</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.870" offset="5215347">But I think more importantly, the background of this case makes it crucially different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.223" offset="5236768">There's two steps involved here to the Government's argument, and they don't really follow through on the second step.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.288" offset="5261009">It's one thing to say did Congress mean the word "knowingly" to apply to this phrase "in any manner", but if you agree with them that it doesn't, then you have the next question: what mental state should be applied to that element of this offense?</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.609" offset="5318270">And this Court has clearly stated on several occasions... in the Bailey case, in the United States Gypsum case, and in the Morissette case... that the mere omission of a word defining the mental intent does not mean that it's strict liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.247" offset="5376888">It does not answer the question just to say there isn't any word there defining the mental element.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.870" offset="5403324">And I think that it's--</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.474" offset="5413773">Well, so the Yermian court then went on and relied on a couple of elements that are not present in this case, the first being that it was a jurisdictional element.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.841" offset="5463197">And the Court clearly stated that jurisdictional language need not contain the same culpability requirement as other elements of the offense, quoting this Court's opinion in Feola.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.068" offset="5512203">And the fact that that was a jurisdictional element in Yermian clearly was a point of distinction for this Court in trying to discern the meaning of Congress in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.517" offset="5553999">Secondly, Yermian had a particular... the statute had a particular legislative history which was debated at length in both the majority and dissenting opinions, which we do not have here... a dissenting opinion where the statute originally made it clear that it was only a defendant that knew he was defrauding the United States could be convicted, and then during... because of the vicissitudes of that statute, that language had been taken out, the issue being how much of the language had been taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.986" offset="5667788">So that the analysis... in other words, my central point is the analysis doesn't stop once you say that Congress didn't mean "knowingly" to apply to this phrase "in any manner".</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.501" offset="5713868">The analysis does not stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.412" offset="5721496">Then you have to look to other principles and... principles of construction, the background of the statute, and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1578.084" offset="6456268">And this is a significant limitation on the reach of Section 2024(b), because it means that only defendants who were aware that they were engaging in certain types of foodstamp transactions, which is the type of activity that almost everyone realizes is subject to some sort of federal regulation, only a defendant of that sort would be subject to conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1883.395" offset="7677440">Well, I think there are several responses to that, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.847" offset="7691233">First, the type of thing that the Court was doing in Gypsum was preventing the offense from really being almost a true strict liability offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.663" offset="7726551">The Court in Gypsum did not require that the defendants be aware that their activities were a violation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.157" offset="7756539">It simply required that they be aware that their activities would have the prohibited effect of inhibiting competition, which is analogous to the type of requirement we are contending for, that the defendant be aware that he is engaging in transactions involving food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.556" offset="7814113">I think Gypsum did not and the court of appeals in this case did not take the further step of requiring proof of familiarity with the requirements of the statutory scheme, which would be a very unusual thing for the court to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.836" offset="7871269">As the Court put it in the International Minerals case, which is probably the case most similar to this involving interpretation of a similar statute, that the general principle to be applied, termed a rule in the International Minerals case, is ignorance of the law does not excuse misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.887" offset="7935426">And that is the type of requirement that the petitioner's contending for: knowledge of the existence of regulations and what those regulations provide.</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.513" offset="11453911">And to the extent that anyone has any doubts about that, the stamps themselves have enough tangible reminders to, I think, make anyone hesitate before engaging in a food stamp transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3005.539" offset="12166008">Well, there is no doubt that some type of knowledge has been made an element of the offense, but I think the language of 2024(b), if construed the way petitioner suggests, would lead to peculiar consequences, given its use of the</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.781" offset="12239047">"any manner not authorized by law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.260" offset="12244898">phrase, which is sort of an open-ended phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.083" offset="12252213">It would require the prosecution to prove, if the requirement is taken literally, that the defendant knew that his actions were not authorized by any existing provision of the Food Stamp Act or of the implementing regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.190" offset="12304666">And has been suggested in some circumstances, some cases, the defendant will have acted in such a suspicious or furtive way that the jury will be able to infer circumstantially that what he must have known what he was doing was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.320" offset="12357120">But that will not always be the case, and the facts here where the defendant seriously contended that he was unaware of the requirements of the food stamp law illustrate what can happen if a knowing illegality element is read into the statute given this open-ended language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.638" offset="12414485">And here the defendant was involved, concededly involved in purchases of large quantities of food stamps for a substantial discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.563" offset="12446146">That is undoubtedly the type of action that most people would suspect to be of questionable propriety, but it would not be enough for conviction if there is a knowing illegality element in the statute that a reasonable person would have doubted the... had doubts about the legality of the defendant's action or that the defendant himself had doubts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.398" offset="12517512">The Government would still be required, so long as the defendant could credibly claim that he had never read the food stamp laws or been told of their contents, the Government might well not have met its burden of proving that the defendant knew that no provision of law or regulation authorized his activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.275" offset="12576967">That is a very peculiar burden to place on the Government, and the court of appeals decision by declining to read such a requirement into the statute essentially has simply made it impossible for individuals who engage in these questionable food stamp transactions to be able to immunize themselves from liability by remaining ignorant of the nature of the food stamp law in the implementing regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.070" offset="12672157">And I should add one very brief point which I think strongly supports the court of appeals decision, and that is the nature of the Food Stamp Act as a whole, and the other provisions of the Food Stamp Act which impose an enormously strict series of requirements and potential penalties on everyone who can be expected to come in contact with stamps to prevent every conceivable misuse of food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.774" offset="12755017">We set out in our brief this very fantastically complex and burdensome series of requirements, and it's very difficult to believe that Congress would have imposed these burdens on everyone who might possibly have any legitimate reason to come into contact with a stamp, and then allowed someone to engage in what everyone would realize to be a doubtful transaction and be able to avoid liability because he never bothered to learn the elements of the food stamp laws or its implementing regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.452" offset="12861702">The nature of the Food Stamp Act I think also gives 2024(b) the characteristics that the Court has said repeatedly are typical of statutes in which Congress has not included a knowing illegality element.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.112" offset="12916350">And I think this responds to your basic point, Justice Stevens, about the danger of putting someone in prison who doesn't know what he was doing was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.336" offset="12945189">I think the presumption the Court has applied in cases like Gypsum and Morissette, when Congress has legislated against the background of common law offense, it is understood, unless it signals its intentions to the contrary, that it did not mean to direct the statute at anyone other than blameworthy defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.737" offset="13010808">But that is not necessarily the presumption of statutes that have no common law analog, that, as Justice Blackmun along the court of appeals termed are statutes of prohibition rather than statutes of punishment that are designed to prevent some significant regulatory injury, and of particular importance, that operate in an area such as the food stamp area where certainly anyone who comes into contact with a stamp has a good idea that there is regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.192" offset="13108611">These are not, as Justice Rehnquist suggested, these are not normal articles of commerce that everyone comes across every day, and they should be on their guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.119" offset="13140376">Now, given the nature of the Food Stamp Act, which allocates with as much precision as possible the necessary number of coupons to individuals in need, any violation of the Act's requirements, whether intentional or whether or not the person knew he was violating the Act's requirements, will detract from the achievement of the congressional purpose by necessarily detracting from the assistance being provided to the recipient household.</text>

            <text syncTime="3349.574" offset="13542139">I do not agree, of course, with the Government that Congress has put a tremendous burden on the Government in proving a case that they would have to prove knowledge of complex regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.675" offset="13590622">What the Government has to prove is that the defendant knew that what he was doing was unauthorized, was in a manner nonauthorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.358" offset="13617267">That doesn't mean that he has to... it's no more difficult than proving criminal intent in any other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.421" offset="13641613">And the Government answers its own argument when it then, in response to the examples that were given about the possible reach of their interpretation, keeps coming back with the argument that reasonable people would have some suspicions in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.949" offset="13695635">That precisely makes my point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.832" offset="13703262">In any kind of case that the Government has any business bringing under this criminal provision, you have a situation... basic fairness dictates that you would have a situation where people would agree a reasonable person should have some suspicions, should have known that there was something wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.614" offset="13766374">And in addition, you have the particular circumstance here of an enforcement program that gives extensive notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.505" offset="13793855">You have visits, warning letters, et cetera, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.287" offset="13805035">So that it's particularly true in this case that wherever the Government is reasonably directing enforcement, this is not a tremendous burden to prove knowledge that they're violating the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.096" offset="13848294">The questioning about the grocer just points out what the possible breadth of reach of the Government's interpretation is, and the regulations are very thick indeed, and the statute is very complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.534" offset="13902002">I, searching for an example, on page 25 of my brief I put in an example about a particularly complex regulation about an elderly person receiving an allotment because he was a separate household from people that he was living with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.542" offset="13958008">And that's the same example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.993" offset="13967831">If he didn't meet those criteria, he would be acquiring his food stamps in a manner not authorized by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.957" offset="13991759">The Government probably reasonably wouldn't prosecute such a person; but I think that we've got to give a reading to the statute that wouldn't allow such--</text>

            <text syncTime="3552.999" offset="14355906">Well, here again, if we're going to have an era where federal trial courts are going to more precisely instruct juries on mental intent than they have with this boilerplate instruction I used in this case, probably there's going to have to be some guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.858" offset="14411285">And I think that in many states in this Union, I think 38 of them, they use the Model Penal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.911" offset="14431556">We don't have a federal criminal code that does that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.174" offset="14440542">But I think that this is a very good example of how using the considered opinion of the American Law Institute would bring about a good definition for a case of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.829" offset="14483174">The question was asked whether United States Gypsum is dispositive here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.711" offset="14502714">What I would like to point out about United States Gypsum is it's one of three cases... the Bailey case, the U.S. Gypsum case, and the Freed case... where this Court has addressed statutes where no intent term is set forth and has adopted the very reasonable positions of the Model Penal Code on what kind of mental elements should be reasonably found in a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.028" offset="14608039">And I think that certainly the U.S. Gypsum case stands for the proposition that if it's a felony, and cites the Model Penal Code for this, you ought not to be sending unknowing persons to prison for a felony except in very limited circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.660" offset="14678570">And I think it's very clear that the only limited circumstances this Court has ever recognized are cases such as Yermian where you're talking about a jurisdiction, and the dangerous instrumentality cases.</text>
