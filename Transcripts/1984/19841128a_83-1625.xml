            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="55.718" offset="368803">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="62.270" offset="395030">This case is here on a writ of certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.646" offset="416555">The question presented concerns the authority of police officers to open bales of marijuana wrapped in plastic bags and found in a vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.461" offset="451873">Specifically, the question is whether the lapse of time that occurred from the discovery of the packages to the time when core samples were taken from those packages, eliminated the officer's prior authority to open the packages without a warrant on the basis of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.363" offset="519478">The facts may be briefly stated as follows: at approximately 1:30 a.m. on August 4, 1981, Customs officers received a report of suspicious activity at a drag strip outside Tucson, Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.140" offset="574544">A car leaving the site was intercepted and its occupants were identified as Respondents Johns and Hearron.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.935" offset="601711">Pursuant to an ongoing investigation, Customs officials already had prior information linking Johns with Respondents Leon and Duarge in an international drug smuggling operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.563" offset="648209">Accordingly, a Customs officer then commenced surveillance at Leon's and Duarte's residences, which led him to follow their two pickup trucks as they headed east on Interstate Highway 10 in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.022" offset="698051">Other officers were contacted, and ground and air surveillance was maintained on the trucks which drove about 100 miles east to a remote airstrip near Bowie, Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.767" offset="740996">Shortly after the trucks arrived, the first of two small planes landed.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.462" offset="763879">The agents on the ground were situated too far away to see what transpired there, but they were told by their colleagues in the air that one of the trucks approached the plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.028" offset="802122">The first plane then departed, and a second plane landed and subsequently departed.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.162" offset="822602">The officers then approached the trucks to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.443" offset="835768">When they got close to them, they smelled marijuana and saw approximately 40 square packages wrapped in plastic, exposed in the back of the trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.292" offset="875161">Five of the Respondents were arrested at the scene, and the trucks and the packages were transported back to a DEA warehouse in Tucson.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.295" offset="907135">Sometime thereafter, three days later, according to the opinion of the Court of Appeals, core samples were taken from some of the bales and sent to the laboratory for analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.282" offset="951125">This analysis confirmed that they were in fact marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.134" offset="962514">No search warrant was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.247" offset="970978">The District Court suppressed the contraband, finding that it was the fruit of a warrantless search that was prohibited by the then controlling Supreme Court authority in Robbins v. California.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.603" offset="1020402">The government appealed, relying primarily on footnote 13 in Arkansas v. Sanders and contending that the telltale odor and the nature of the packaging of these bales made the contents sufficiently obvious that no warrant was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.743" offset="1080901">While the case was pending on appeal, this Court decided United States v. Ross, and the parties submitted supplemental memoranda to address the significance of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.741" offset="1124891">The government claimed that ross was dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.914" offset="1137639">Respondents made two arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.785" offset="1145162">First, they claimed that Ross should not be applied retroactively, and second, they contended that Ross did not apply in this case because the probable cause focused on the packages themselves, not on the trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.444" offset="1195735">The Court of Appeals rejected both of these arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.924" offset="1209633">However, it found for Respondents on a ground not briefed by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.077" offset="1226247">The Court ruled that a warrant was required to open the packages after the three-day delay, even though one would not have been required had the search been conducted immediately at the scene or immediately at the station house.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.755" offset="1272953">The Court denied the government's petition for rehearing and the government petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.868" offset="1293433">Respondents make two arguments in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.091" offset="1306390">First, they renew their claim that was rejected by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.133" offset="1322482">They claim that Ross does not apply here because the probable cause focused on the packages.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.848" offset="1345365">Rather, they contend that this case is analogous to United States v. Chadwick and therefore that the police always needed a warrant to open the packages, even if they had been searched immediately at the scene of the seizure at the airstrip.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.446" offset="1395729">This contention is somewhat factbound.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.398" offset="1407536">It was rejected by the Court of Appeals and is addressed in detail in our reply brief, and I do not plan to dwell on it at length in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.802" offset="1437211">Let me just say briefly that the agents' observations here plainly gave them probable cause to search the trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.558" offset="1468245">They were not close enough to see anything specific that happened when the airplanes landed.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.421" offset="1487680">What they did know was that persons involved, known to be involved in a drug smuggling operation had driven two trucks and met two airplanes at an airstrip and apparently had received something from the airplanes.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.169" offset="1538671">They had good reason to believe that contraband had been transferred to the trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.859" offset="1553404">They did not see any packages.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.542" offset="1560196">They did not even know of the existence of any specific kind of packages until they approached the trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.855" offset="1581407">When they did approach the trucks and saw the packages wrapped in plastic, naturally their attention focused on those packages.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.780" offset="1609097">But that does not alter the fact that their suspicion from the beginning was focused on the trucks themselves, not on the packages.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.744" offset="1636996">This case in respect is exactly like Ross and completely unlike Chadwick and Arkansas v. Sanders, cases in which the police had suspicion that was focused on particular packages or containers in those cases, and the relationship... excuse me, they had a suspicion even before the packages were ever placed in a vehicle, and the fact that they were later placed in a vehicle before the seizure was quite coincidental to the nature of the suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.273" offset="1755069">I would also say that applying Ross in this case leads to the only sensible result here, that it would be quite unreasonable to have required the police to get a warrant at the scene when they... in order to take core samples or to open these bales that were reeking of marijuana at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.855" offset="1825391">If there are no questions on that point, I will turn to Respondents' second contention, which is the focus of our petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.970" offset="1853812">That is, assuming that Ross applies here and that the police could have searched the bales at the scene without a warrant, Respondents argue that the police nonetheless needed a warrant when they opened the packages at the station a few days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.459" offset="1911804">This argument that this delay alone created a warrant requirement is completely foreclosed by prior decisions of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="452.556" offset="1956212">I am troubled by the state of the record in this case because you can't tell when the search took place.</text>

            <text syncTime="475.540" offset="2048163">What I would like to ask you is who do you think has the... I would think you would assume that if it took place a year later, it would be unreasonable, at some point in time maybe you can't search.</text>

            <text syncTime="857.194" offset="3574759">Well, that's our view, but I think the Respondents' view and the Court of Appeals' view is that as soon as you get past the time when they could have gotten a warrant, the length of time doesn't matter, and a much shorter time is good enough to grant a suppression motion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.060" offset="3626168">That is the legal principle we have a problem with, and that is why we are petitioning here.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.534" offset="3644140">So from the perspective of the decision below, I don't think it matters at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.657" offset="3664620">In our view, the contention that the delay here by itself created a warrant requirement is foreclosed by the prior decisions of this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.286" offset="3715089">The Respondents did not dispute here at all that the police could have searched the trucks themselves even three days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.361" offset="3739435">That principle is established by a long line of positions here, beginning with Chambers v. Maroney, continuing through Texas v. White and Michigan v. Thomas, and in fact, last term, in Florida v. Meyers, all nine Justices of this Court characterized that proposition as well settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.349" offset="3803383">What Respondents do argue here is that at some point during the time that the packages were at the stationhouse, a point that they define somewhat imprecisely as the time limit became practicable to get a warrant, the packages themselves became analytically distinct from the trucks on which they were found, and they could at that point no longer be searched without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.871" offset="3917486">This argument is completely contrary to Ross on two separate points.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.862" offset="3937443">First, the basis for the decision in Ross is that the authority to conduct an automobile search extends to the entire automobile, including its contents, which includes the packages found inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.569" offset="3984255">That is to say, the search of a package found in an automobile is part of the automobile search itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.223" offset="4006824">It is not distinct at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.956" offset="4013825">Just as the justification for the automobile search, that is to say, probable cause, continues to authorize a warrantless search of the vehicle after it has been impounded at the station, so does that justification authorize the search of a package at that time as part of that vehicle search.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.377" offset="4083520">Second, Ross clearly confirms that the validity of a warrantless automobile search does not depend on any special exigency.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.453" offset="4119778">Indeed, if it did, the packages and the trucks in this case probably could not have been searched without a warrant even at the scene since the Respondents had been arrested and the trucks had been secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.511" offset="4168052">Certainly if Respondents were correct on this point, the trucks and the packages could not have been searched once they had been taken to DEA headquarters, even if that search had been conducted quite promptly there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.218" offset="4210893">These Courts' case from Chambers through Florida v. Meyers, however, make it clear that the trucks in fact could have been searched at the stationhouse, even after some time had elapsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.704" offset="4252793">Thus, Respondents' contention--</text>

            <text syncTime="1085.541" offset="4488104">I think that is clear from the Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.954" offset="4501793">The Court has said that even though the exigency has been removed at the stationhouse, the search is still allowed to be performed without a warrant, and at that point I don't think it matters whether it is eight hours or a day or even a month, at least as far as those principles go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.347" offset="4567412">But the contention that the exigency here, the question of exigency, when it became practical to get a warrant, is sharply at odds with Ross.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.095" offset="4618403">This case, as recognized in Ross and discussed in other automobile search cases in this Court, involves a recognized exception to the warrant requirement, an exception that is distinct from the exigent circumstances doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.970" offset="4665842">When probable cause exists to search an automobile and its contents seized on the highway, the practicability of obtaining a warrant at some time after the seizure is not a relevant consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.688" offset="4712758">Now, putting aside for the moment the dispositive precedent on this point, there is still no reason, no common sense reason why the delay should have any effect on the ability to conduct a warrantless search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.816" offset="4761241">As the Court explained in Ross, the scope of an automobile search is precisely the same as the scope of a search that could be authorized by a magistrate through a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.876" offset="4813486">Reading from page 823 of Ross, the Court said the scope of a warrantless search based on probable cause is no narrower and no broader than the scope of a search authorized by a warrant supported by probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.385" offset="4871478">Only the prior approval of the magistrate is waived.</text>

            <text syncTime="1208.413" offset="4979624">Certainly policy considerations lend no support to the Court of Appeals' holding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1233.057" offset="5078158">It cannot seriously be contended that the delay itself created an expectation of privacy in the package that did not exist previously and that could not be invaded without obtaining a search warrant from a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.226" offset="5126851">Under Ross, the placement of a package in an automobile sufficiently reduces his expectation of privacy that it may be searched on the basis of probable cause without a warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.268" offset="6115011">They have an interest in getting things moving.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.790" offset="6125146">But I don't see what reason they would have to complain about it, even if the search had taken longer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1500.584" offset="6148343">It seems to me that there is simply no reason to inject uncertainty into what is at least at this point a fairly well settled area of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1513.902" offset="6201633">There is no interest here that requires a special rule to protect Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.026" offset="6222113">The police have no incentive unnecessarily to delay opening the packages that are found in an automobile when they want to search them on the basis of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.171" offset="6254713">Even acting without any fear at all at the invocation of the exclusionary rule, the police's desire to advance the course of its investigation suggests that officers will search such packages as soon as practicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.679" offset="6300689">Therefore, there is no need to create a rule to prevent officers from delaying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.533" offset="6324095">Secondly, to the extent there is any delay... and that is really illustrated in this case... it a does not really prejudice the owners of the packages in the absence of some other set of facts like the locked briefcase that we have been discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.662" offset="6384594">I think it is important to emphasize here that even though the question in this case is whether the police needed to get a warrant or not, this is not really like the normal warrant case where there is a concern of protecting the individual's privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.310" offset="6439242">Normally in a case where the court imposes a warrant requirement, the reason is to interpose the magistrate in between so that the police's own determination of probable cause is not a justification for search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.441" offset="6499742">Therefore, in a case where the police turn out to be wrong, there is a real privacy intrusion in that something is searched for no reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.256" offset="6527014">But that is not the case here because even if the Court of Appeals is affirmed, the police are still entitled to conduct a warrantless search here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.238" offset="6554913">It does not protect against the danger that the police are going to misapprehend the nature of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.314" offset="6575184">The only thing that is gained by applying the Court of Appeals' rationale is that the police will be prevented from delaying, and as I said before, that delay does not hurt the Defendants, and there is no incentive for the police to do it anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="3427.958" offset="13857809">Let me just make a brief point about this question of whether the trucks were searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.571" offset="13876304">We agree with Justice Stevens that the crucial issue here is the probable cause to search the trucks, not the subjective motivation of the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.367" offset="13907442">But as a matter of fact here, I think the trucks were searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.110" offset="13918413">It is just that these bales were sitting open in the back of the trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.660" offset="13932624">So it didn't have to be very extensive search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.501" offset="13939938">They came up to search the trucks, and right away they saw the packages there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.892" offset="13953522">It is exactly the same case as Ross.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.825" offset="13961254">There is no reason to think in Ross that the police ripped the car apart after they found the paper bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.068" offset="13982256">Once they found the package, they thought they found what they were looking for, and they didn't continue the search there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.321" offset="14003259">I think it is irrelevant whether the trucks were searched later at the station, but there is no evidence... we don't really know from the record whether they were or they weren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.566" offset="14036278">The only evidence that I found, actually, very obliquely suggests that they were in fact searched.</text>

            <text syncTime="3488.647" offset="14100539">And finally, if the Court is disposed to accept this argument that Ross does not apply here at all, we would suggest that a warrantless search was nevertheless permissible under the theory of Footnote 13 of Sanders.</text>
