            <text syncTime="1545.334" offset="6311788">She testified, when she was asked by the Secretary of Labor, well, suppose that you needed some assistance; what would you do for the benefits that you need to live?</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.792" offset="6353584">And she said, well, we'd go out and get them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.844" offset="6369780">Now, the Secretary of Labor interpreted that as meaning that they would go out into the Foundation and in the Foundation's activities and work and get these benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.017" offset="6406456">She didn't mean that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.567" offset="6408650">If you would read all of her testimony, what she was saying was, if they did not have the benefit, they would go outside the Foundation and work, which many of them did.</text>

Portland Terminal, where these people worked in business activities, agreed-upon were common business activities and were common businesses, and these people did not want a wage, they did not expect a wage, they so stated, and this Court in Rawlings v. Portland Terminal, said that they didn't have to receive it and they were not covered by the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3344.610" offset="13508836">It's rather difficult in respect to the associates to understand precisely what the burden upon them is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.866" offset="13537884">They claim at one point that it would prevent them from being free to contribute their labor, but of course that's not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.270" offset="13567559">They are free to contribute to their labor; what they are not free to do is to exchange their labor for material benefits at less than the minimum wage; nor, it should be said, is there anything akin to a vow of poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.897" offset="13634015">Indeed, a number of the associates testified that they were rather proud of the prosperity of the Foundation and of the prosperity in which they shared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.187" offset="13675184">I refer to the testimony of Mr. Mick who spoke at some length about the three bedroom house and washer and dryer that he enjoyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.774" offset="13709561">This was not a monastic arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.995" offset="13726384">So perhaps what we have here is some kind of an entanglement argument, but in either event, this is a case where this Court's rationale in United States v. Lee applies and applies with considerable force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.706" offset="13793257">Here we have a compelling state interest to protect against substandard wages and to protect against "an unfair method of competition" and a purpose which could scarcely be pursued without the comprehensiveness of the statute, more so than in Lee, because it is not merely an administrative or actuarial comprehensiveness that's necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.624" offset="13904957">What is necessary is to protect third parties, competing businesses, from the effect of substandard wages paid by a competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.616" offset="13960859">So it's hard to see how in the holdings of this Court, from the Jacobson case through United States v. Lee, we would not see a compelling state purpose in this case which could not readily be served other than by applying the Fair Labor Standards Act to the Foundation and the associates.</text>
