            <text syncTime="9.872" offset="176048">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case requires close analysis of an extraordinary conclusion of a lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.312" offset="217844">The Oregon Court of Appeals used an extreme extension of the Miranda Doctrine to suppress a fully-advised, utterly voluntary, and clearly cuspirating confession of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.852" offset="255982">That court applied a per se exclusionary rule because of an earlier marginal violation of the outer perimeters of the Miranda Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.708" offset="291404">This circumstance gives rise to a question which this Court has never faced squarely before.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.045" offset="320766">The defendant was convicted of a burglary following a full confession of his complicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.433" offset="338320">The signed confession was scrupulously preceded by Miranda advice and by oral and written waivers of all rights, including the right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.753" offset="371653">Defendant declared and exercised his desire to give a full accounting of his involvement in the burglary, and the validity of his waiver was never challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.108" offset="404985">Yet, at trial, the defendant sought unsuccessfully to suppress this fully voluntary confession on the basis of an earlier limited admission which had not been preceded by Miranda advice which suggested his presence at the crime scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.118" offset="461096">The trial court expressly found that the full confession was voluntary and that it was not tainted by his earlier limited statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.491" offset="494533">This case is before this Court only because the Court of Appeals in Oregon accepted defendant's theory that a per se rule of exclusion should govern the second statement and render it invalid because the</text>
            <text syncTime="101.199" offset="541448">"cat was out of the bag. "</text>
            <text syncTime="103.400" offset="550226">To suppress the confession in this case is not only without basis in the Fifth Amendment, it is fundamentally itself disrespectful of the importance and desired effect of the required Miranda warnings fashioned by this Court nearly two decades ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.291" offset="605814">There is, in fact, no evidence on this record of a connection between the two statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.695" offset="623368">The Court of Appeals used no legal analysis to establish it, and instead applied a metaphor as a substitute for reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.949" offset="652417">The "cat out of the bag" metaphor is born of a context clearly different than that utilized in this case because it was born from the involuntary or coerced confession cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.389" offset="690137">When the violation at stake is a Miranda violation, the metaphor is psychologically simplistic, does not do justice to the facts or analysis of this case, it will not work a proper result, it disables the police from correcting mistakes, it imposes excessively high cost without deterring police misconduct or improper practices, and it undervalues the importance of Miranda warnings as well as the central core of informed consent which we believe lies at the heart of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.676" offset="815316">The metaphors of the court are inadequate to provide guidance because under a proper analysis, and even pursuing the metaphor further, there is no evidence that "cat" was ever "in the bag at all".</text>
            <text syncTime="181.918" offset="864322">There's no evidence that the defendant really meant to or wanted to keep quiet.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.054" offset="880831">There is no evidence of compulsion which got in the way of his intention to make a clean breast of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.535" offset="966722">An acknowledgment which is ambiguous in the sense that it could mean that the individual was a witness to, rather than a participant in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.722" offset="995457">In any event, it is a far cry from earlier cases which this Court has decided in which a later confession is admitted, even though the earlier statement is far more indicative of complicity.</text>

            <text syncTime="237.154" offset="1085213">We believe that it used a figure of speech as a substitute for evidence of causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.891" offset="1108201">Even having done so, however, it's clear from this Court's decision, that causation is only one condition under which one suppresses evidence, and one still must have a fruit where deterrence justifies suppression as opposed to admitting highly probative evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.686" offset="1179359">The second thing, Justice Rehnquist, is that the Court of Appeals may have believed that this bore on the defendant's waiver, the voluntariness of the waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.791" offset="1215721">But that conclusion, if that's what the court meant, flies in the face of an explicit finding of the trial court that there was, in fact, no taint, no connection between the two statements, and that the defendant's conclusion was fully voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.849" offset="1267966">It shows, in short, the worst possible example that we could bring to this Court of a metaphor substituting itself for legal reasoning, suggesting on one hand perhaps the existence of coercion, which is this record doesn't show, or suggesting the invalidity of a waiver, or suggesting causation which no record evidence otherwise would demonstrate between the existence of the first limited statement and the second.</text>

            <text syncTime="619.902" offset="2616198">And since that goes to the heart of one of our central propositions, let me suggest why it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.356" offset="2634066">First, because it deals only with the causation factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.725" offset="2647545">We contend that, in fact, there is no causation in this case and that relates to my response to Justice Burger... Chief Justice Burger's question about the intervention of the father's anger.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.248" offset="2681608">But, second, even if there is causation, that is, a relationship between the first admission and the second confession, that does not perpetually disable the accused from confessing.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.686" offset="2723300">And the reason that it doesn't is dealt with in the Bayer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.757" offset="2739600">Now, bear in mind a crucial distinction here because it's central to our argument and I wish to reiterate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.475" offset="2758513">That is, that the Bayer case and the Darwin case in its progeny dealt with coerced confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.946" offset="2780351">They dealt with involuntary confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.981" offset="2788502">They dealt with a set of circumstances in which the individual is not free under his own concept of self-determination voluntarily to come forward and waive a Fifth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.437" offset="2830402">That is not and cannot be the case in a situation where the violation is of the prophylactic rules that surround the Miranda case, because in that case it is at best a presumption of police coercion, which it is the purpose of the warnings to dispel.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.715" offset="2895499">So we understand the meaning of the Bayer case to be simply this: that in order for the second confession to be admissible and usable against the defendant, those conditions which gave rise to the illegality must be cured in some form or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.642" offset="2955163">In the case of coerced confessions or involuntary confessions, it's not surprising that this Court's previous decisions suggest that the way to cure it is some lapse of time or some distance in circumstances or some release from custody, because those are the kinds of situations that would cure an actual atmosphere of duress or coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.119" offset="3033112">But where, as in this case, the constitutional violation that exists lies in the failure to give the Miranda warnings such as the individual has not been restored to his ability to make an informed decision about waiver, then the cure for the violation, if it exists and if it in fact might have caused the second confession, is the giving of the Miranda warnings and a full and valid waiver after those warnings, because the presumption then is that the illegal condition, the illegal thing, has been removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.223" offset="3149514">So we believe that, in fact, the flaw of the "cat out of the bag" metaphor is, first of all, its origins in the coerced confession cases and the failure of subsequent lower courts in this nation to recognize that other conditions may arise.</text>

            <text syncTime="795.752" offset="3319623">In this case, Elstad clearly knew that the police had an arrest warrant, and were he aware of the law, would have to have understood that from independent evidence, not out of his mouth, the police possessed sufficient information for probable cause to detain him.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.992" offset="3372599">I believe this Court has never required that in the course of securing a valid confession, that the defendant must have been in full possession of all knowledge as to what a trial court or an appellate court would later ratify as having been validly admissible items of evidence against that particular defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1486.214" offset="6081497">And it's this: the presumption of station house coercive... an atmosphere of coercion in the station house, such that something must be done by police officers if they wish to secure a waiver of the right to counsel and the right not to speak, there must be some statement by official authority that gives the individual a clear knowledge of his own right to self-determination.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary D. Babcock</label>
            <text syncTime="1568.216" offset="6409491">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, what police misconduct are we talking about by way of deterrence?</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.557" offset="6450869">You are not about to apply the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine unless you find something to deter by way of police misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.160" offset="6485246">Now, there were two of them in this case, and I'll tie these directly to the trial, given enough words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.232" offset="6513563">The first was manipulation of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.951" offset="6528400">And as you know, you don't have to advise under Miranda until there's custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.755" offset="6547626">The second... and this is going to be the second part of my argument... is the manipulation of Elstad's waiver in the obtaining of his confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.294" offset="6585765">Now, I've got to go a little slower here as far as talking about the particular record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.282" offset="6609693">This case is very different to me because it has an arrest warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.835" offset="6627979">Most of the cases I deal with, we're talking about probable cause without a warrant, and the police have to do some investigation, justifiably so, to find probable cause before they arrest the person and take him downtown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.809" offset="6679806">Here, Officers McAllister and Burke, when they left the station house, had an arrest warrant in their back pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.963" offset="6708436">That meant two things: They had probable cause, and they had identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.617" offset="6731111">And they both testified in the transcript that they were going to the Elstad house for one purpose and one purpose only, and that was to arrest Elstad and take him to the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.192" offset="6777399">And they get to the house and knock on the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.210" offset="6785445">Mrs. Elstad answers the door; the police properly identify themselves, and they say "Is your boy home"?</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.947" offset="6808433">This is a 19-year-old boy, no prior criminal record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.399" offset="6818151">He's in the bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.932" offset="6824315">So the police officers proceed with the mother to the bedroom to where the boy is lying naked, except for a pair of shorts, on the bed listening to a radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.772" offset="6859737">Two police officers, now armed with a warrant, walk in and they tell him to get dressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.826" offset="6875933">Now, we don't know how long they were in the bedroom, in Elstad's bedroom, because we don't... it's not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.163" offset="6905295">We know that the warrant wasn't executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.098" offset="6916998">Now, a very important thing that comes up next, fact-finding-wise, as far as custody goes, and also as far as police misconduct, is after Elstad gets his clothes on, Burke takes Elstad not to the police car, but he takes and isolates him in the living room.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.457" offset="6982408">And McAllister takes Elstad's mother and takes her to the kitchen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.677" offset="7003306">Now, the only advice that's given during this stage of the game is the fact that McAllister tells the mother, look it; we've got this arrest warrant, and this is the only time I know of that it's ever executed is on the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.669" offset="7051267">And they say, we don't want you to be upset with these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.473" offset="7070493">In the meantime, that's what happens with the mother, and I don't know where she goes, except she's probably around when they take him to the police car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.460" offset="7098392">A chief feature here again of misconduct, and we're getting to Justice Stevens's question very soon on what happens at the police station with the waiver... but then the interrogation starts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.498" offset="7138621">No execution of the warrant by Burke, but he says, do you know the victims?</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.950" offset="7152413">And the defendant admitted, yes, he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.802" offset="7159832">And he said, I had heard there was a burglary there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.521" offset="7170699">And Burke says, yeah, and you were involved, weren't you?</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.556" offset="7182820">And now this key language of "I was there".</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.992" offset="7192537">I've got to stop for one moment and mention the two things that the Solicitor General and the Attorney General... positions they take.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.812" offset="7215839">They take two positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.229" offset="7221481">One, they fire back on... first of all, they take the position I was there is like being downtown in the First Interstate Bank on Wednesday afternoon in front of the tellers, and there's hundreds of people in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.220" offset="7261501">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.987" offset="7264531">"I was there" was equal to, in this man's mind, in being in the First Interstate Bank on Sunday afternoon in the vault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.873" offset="7292116">"I was there" is equal to "I am a burglar".</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.075" offset="7304864">The people that owned this property were away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.261" offset="7313641">If you said you were in that house, you were a burglar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.296" offset="7325762">So there's no problem about it being exonerating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.248" offset="7333599">It was equal to a confession, and I'm going to refer to it as a confession to make my job easier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.919" offset="7356273">The second problem is inducement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.852" offset="7364005">The inducement, this causation factor that we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.104" offset="7377066">And it has been mentioned here today about this fact that the State has the burden of proof here, not us; because theirs is the constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.477" offset="7402562">Now, the inducement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.577" offset="7406951">Everything's going fine here with Elstad and Officer Burke in their discussions in the living room until he said "I was there", and all of a sudden he's in the police car and downtown behind bars.</text>

            <text syncTime="2808.781" offset="11371711">Well, Michigan v. Tucker, I would say I have a difficult time with that, in the sense I don't see that as a Miranda case, because the man gave an alibi defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.137" offset="11405148">The case was handed down before, Miranda v. Arizona; the police were totally bona fide; in fact, they were almost clairvoyant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.475" offset="11430539">They almost knew what kind of advice to give.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.159" offset="11441197">They left out the magic word "indigent".</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.294" offset="11449765">And that was the Attorney General classifies as a technical violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.080" offset="11468887">There was no deterrent value to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.134" offset="11481112">It's a case that's not, I don't think, against us or for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.519" offset="11498666">It's a case where it should have been affirmed there was no police misconduct to deter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.840" offset="11523953">This is a much different case, as I've been trying to explain in these last few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.060" offset="11540880">So Tucker v.... I don't think even Harrison v. U.S., whether it was reversed, there was any deterrent value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.714" offset="11571496">But the important part is the deterrent value, and I would not say to expand Miranda; limit it to an arrest warrant situation where the police have obtained an improper confession in the first instance and obtained the fruits of that violation, and not given proper advice to dispel that notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.759" offset="11639623">That's pure attenuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.877" offset="11648087">And keep it very limited; I think in most cases, the police have to go on in the house and other places and investigate and ask questions.</text>

            <label>Mr. David B. Frohnmayer</label>
            <text syncTime="2899.125" offset="11733142">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.075" offset="11736903">I have three points for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.493" offset="11746621">The first is that the issue of the manipulation of custody of defendant was not argued below, nor does the record support that assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.032" offset="11780684">Defendant below simply argued that the second confession had to be suppressed because the first admission had let the cat out of the bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.686" offset="11807329">It was the "cat out of the bag" metaphor in psychology.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.454" offset="11818405">My second point relates, Justice Stevens, to what I hope is a more complete answer to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.042" offset="11840766">That is, that Miranda advice repairs a pure Miranda defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.679" offset="11863336">Miranda advice does not necessarily repair a Fourth Amendment defect, as this Court has held in the trilogy of cases involving Brown v. Illinois and Dunaway; nor does it necessarily cure a case in which there is actual coercion under the Fifth Amendment which is a core constitutional violation as opposed to what Justice O'Connor was indicating in the colloquy with counsel, a violation of the rule of Miranda.</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="2956.461" offset="11962497">That's very helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.579" offset="11966885">It really is, because I think perhaps the case boils down to this colloquy with Justice O'Connor; is whether a Miranda violation is actually a constitutional violation, or is it merely some kind of court-made rule that does not amount to that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.971" offset="12020488">And I must confess that if it's not a constitutional violation, I don't know where this Court ever had the power to set aside any state conviction on the ground that they didn't follow a rule we thought it would be a good rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.112" offset="12061031">It seems to me, analytically, it must be a constitutional violation or else we have no business in this area at all.</text>

            <label>Mr. David B. Frohnmayer</label>
            <text syncTime="2988.365" offset="12090079">Except that under either reading, this Court of Appeals decision should be reversed because if it is a core constitutional violation, the core of the constitutional violation was cured by the giving of the warrant.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3002.775" stopTime="3029.925">
            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3002.775" offset="12147653">Well, see, my problem is, if you regard it as a constitutional violation, then you have some difficulty, at least it seems to me, saying that it's any different from point of view of shifting burdens and causation and all that, between this case and one in which the man was actually physically beaten, because in either event it's the same constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.737" offset="12223512">But if you say, as Justice O'Connor suggests, that it's really not a constitutional violation, it's kind of a second-class wrong, then there's integrity in your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. David B. Frohnmayer</label>
            <text syncTime="3029.925" offset="12256322">Well, I think, respectfully, there's integrity in either case because even before the Miranda violation was... the Miranda doctrine was violated, this Court examined a number of cases in which there had been an earlier coerced confession in which a cure had been effected by removal of the defendant from time or place which caused the recreation of the voluntary condition for the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.523" offset="12342735">Here, where the violation is at least at the outer periphery of the Fifth Amendment, if it's there at all, as opposed to your rule, compliance with the rule restores that element of voluntariness and destroys the presumption of station house coercion which the rule was meant to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.134" offset="12409191">And that's the thrust of our argument, and I believe responsive to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.419" offset="12426327">The final point is simply this: And that is, that my colleague from the Public Defender's Office has mentioned the issue of deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.506" offset="12454644">And if one turns that question on its head and looks to what is being deterred, if this second, valid, voluntary, trustworthy confession is excluded, it's far more damaging than any police conduct that might otherwise be deterred by throwing out everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.599" offset="12510964">And the reason for that is that it would send a message to the police that if you make a mistake, you can't fix it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.903" offset="12536250">It would send a message to the police that if an error has been made in the initial advisal of rights to the defendant, he is forever foreclosed--</text>
