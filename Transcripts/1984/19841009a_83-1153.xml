            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>

          <turn speaker="marvin_e_frankel" startTime="78.933" stopTime="694.786">
            <label>Mr. Marvin E. Frankel</label>
            <text syncTime="78.933" offset="447315">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case has a similar superficial sound to the one preceding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.856" offset="478975">This, too, is a case of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.510" offset="497679">And here again, the petitioner, Mills Music, is arguing among other things, that the Court of Appeals reversing the district court violated the rule that it ought to read the statute and follow the plain meaning of what Congress wrote.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.887" offset="575106">The statute here is determination of transfer provisions of the Copyright Act of 1976 and, more specifically, the one sentence exception to the results of termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.647" offset="634142">The provisions that are in issue are set out at pages 14 and 15 petitioner's blue brief, and I'll be talking about them and focusing most particularly, as I say, on a single sentence, the Exception that both lower courts describe with a capital E to focus on its centrality in the case, which is subsection A of 304(c)(6) there on page 15 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.718" offset="766427">Very briefly, 1 time remind the Court of the relevant statutory background.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.308" offset="792862">The Copyright Act of 1976, extending copyright terms in general to 75 years for old copyrights, that is, pre-Act copyrights, and to life of the author plus 50 years for new copyrights, also created a termination provision by which authors or their heirs could terminate grants of transfers or licenses of their copyrights.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.962" offset="927445">There are two separate sections that embody this termination idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.766" offset="946671">One, section 203, relates to new copyrights after the effective date of the new Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.872" offset="983138">The other, section 304, relates to preexisting copyrights.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.026" offset="1007693">We deal with 304 here, but as the courts below indicated, and I think the parties agree, both sections are identical for our purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.314" offset="1048862">Both contain the identical exception for derivative works set out at page 15 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.587" offset="1085956">And it is that exception that the case is about, and I'll be talking about that sentence, I think, in some little detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.628" offset="1126080">The undisputed facts that led to the summary judgment motions and decision in the district court are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.401" offset="1161189">In 1923, three authors, including Ted Snyder, wrote a song, a popular song called "Who's Sorry Now"?</text>
            <text syncTime="267.939" offset="1203403">We're concerned only with Ted Snyder's interest and the interest of his heirs, Marie Snyder and Ted Snyder, Jr., and I'll be referring to him, as we have throughout, as the author.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.016" offset="1255648">In 1940, Snyder assigned the renewal term of his copyright to the Mills Music Company, the petitioner here, in a form of assignment that, as both courts below said, is typical of the music business and typical of a number of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.196" offset="1348435">And it appears at the beginning of page 41 of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.416" offset="1369228">The provisions of direct and central interest to us are the provisions for the licensing by Mills of recordings of the song.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.443" offset="1429414">Snyder, in a sense, did not transfer all his rights under the copyright, and I mean in the sense that be retained under the terms of his graft a 50 percent interest in the net royalties from licenses for recordings that Mills was authorized to issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.291" offset="1520738">Now, that, as both courts below said, is a standard or typical arrangement in the music business.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.230" offset="1560549">And its standardness and typicality is a point of some consequence, in our view, for the correct construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.538" offset="1605793">And I might add, as the Court of Appeals indicated, that multi-grant situations of the kind we have here are typical net only in the music business, but in other fields of artistic work and the business relationships that grow up around artistic works, and that is, among other reasons we take it, why this is a case warranting review on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.439" offset="1713313">After the effective date of the new Act, the heirs of Ted Snyder, whose widow and his son, who is a conservator of the widow, exercised the power given under that statute 3O4(c) to terminate the graft, terminate the grant from Ted Snyder to Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.007" offset="1815609">They exercised it by giving a notice to Mills referring to that grant and terminated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.427" offset="1841313">And there is no dispute that that's the only grant they purported to terminate and, for our purposes, the only grant they could terminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.551" offset="1881855">Everyone agrees that as a result of the termination, they recapture 100 percent of all rights in the copyright going forward from the effective date of the termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.776" offset="1934727">They can license new recordings.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.744" offset="1942564">They can reap rewards from sheet music.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.696" offset="1962417">They can use it in movies and wherever else popular songs are exploited.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.767" offset="1982688">And this appears to be still a popular song that produces considerable royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.355" offset="2012990">There is, as I've said, an exception to what reverts to them, and that's what the case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.193" offset="2044337">That exception, the exception for derivative works, relates to sound recordings, in our case, a form of derivative work licensed by Mills prior to the termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.555" offset="2105777">Prior to the termination, as I've said, the net royalties were shared equally, 50/50 under the standard practice in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.594" offset="2149976">Mills's position is that under the plain words of that statute which Mills contends Congress knew what it was doing when it wrote it, under those plain words, Mills contends that Congress, for those old derivative works, issued under the authority of Mills, the old arrangement of equal sharing continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.978" offset="2247465">The position of the Snyders is that that's not so, and that the Snyders now get 100 percent of those royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.517" offset="2289679">Their position was rejected by Judge Weinfeld in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.821" offset="2310890">Judge Weinfeld said the position is one that requires a tortured reading of that exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.843" offset="2342969">But Judge Weinfeld characteristically did not stop with the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.728" offset="2362508">He went ahead and wrote what the Circuit properly called a characteristically comprehensive opinion, traced through the history, traced through the policies and the purposes of Congress in this enactment, and concluded that, if anything, that history buttressed what the plain language said, certainly did not warrant altering it or deviating from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.529" offset="2465744">The Circuit, as I say, reversed and reversed... and I'll be returning to this... on the basic premise, as stated by the Circuit... that Congress did not realize what it was legislating about when it legislated for the exception, was not aware of or did not have in mind the standard or typical or common multiple grant situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.000" offset="2591550">And our position on that, which I will enlarge upon is, that you're dealing with a statute that was 20 years in the making, that the Circuit emphasizes correctly was initially produced after long study by the Copyright Office, and you have a decision of the Court of Appeals saying that, throughout the 20 years of that gestation, the Copyright Office which lives with copyrights and the business relationships every day in the week, didn't realize that this exception would be treating that standard or typical arrangement, and that Congress... which was at this for ten years... didn't realize it either.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.779" offset="2770750">We say with respect to the Circuit that that's a drastically wrong way to view the work of Congress and to interpret a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.152" offset="2812232">We say it is contrary to what the Court would presume if it had no evidence of anything about what Congress knew or didn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.609" offset="2854028">This Court has said more than once that if you have nothing else to go on, a judge ought to presume that the Congress knows what it's dealing with when it legislates, knows what's out there in the world that will affected by the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="794.963" offset="3311484">The only grant that was terminated is the grant from Snyder to Mills.</text>

            <text syncTime="804.302" offset="3348787">Now, the only thing that the exception applies to or could apply to is a derivative work prepared under authority of that grant, because obviously the exception is referring to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.396" offset="3405212">If you're dealing with a derivative work that was not prepared under the authority of that grant, but some other grant, it doesn't get into the exception at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.537" offset="3453695">The exception only applies to that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.406" offset="3469264">Now, our friends say obviously what Congress wanted to protect in this case are the 419 licensees authorized by Mills to make recordings.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.565" offset="3521822">If the concern is to protect them... and we agree it is... the only way they get protected is by virtue of this exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.123" offset="3564141">And while the exception does not say in so many words, this applies to the typical arrangement and the judges are to read it faithfully and understand what it means, and assume Congress knew what it was talking about, and see how it works... while it doesn't say that, it fits with great comfort and intelligibility, as Judge Weinfeld held, if somebody's looking at it with a purpose to serve the mandate of Congress, which we think is the judicial purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.142" offset="3692141">One way to illustrate that, Your Honor, is to look at what the Court of Appeals said.</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.487" offset="6285578">They used the example of movies, for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.439" offset="6297385">In many movie deals, an author sells the movie rights to his or her book outright, and people make movies based upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.462" offset="6337404">Under this statute, those movies could continue to be exhibited, and the original author would get nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1564.888" offset="6391112">Whatever the old deal was, having in mind that Congress didn't know who did what to whom with respect to old derivative works, Congress knew... and it's in the legislative record, as the courts below knew... that publishers are not mere middle men, that authors don't just give their copyrights to publishers out of a feckless love for these companies so that they can collect money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.324" offset="6508872">But they give those rights to publishers because publishers promote, plug, sell the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.895" offset="6531129">And Congress knew that, the Copyright Office knew that, and they legislated accordingly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.699" offset="6778351">What that's saying is that in the same section of the same statute, when it used the word "grant", Congress used it to have two different meanings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.187" offset="7724298">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the Snyders contend that this argument, both in the brief as well as orally, on behalf of Mills, really avoids and evades the principal issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.880" offset="7791171">And that is the contention that the Snyders made successfully in the court below, that there is absolutely nothing in the statutory language, whether it's in the basic reversion section or the exception thereto, or any of the purposes of Congress in passing this language, which can indicate that Mills, as a publisher, is a benefitted class under this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.582" offset="7917917">There is just no language in this statutory set of provisions which deals with anyone in the nature of Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.773" offset="7962743">It is argued that the language is plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.658" offset="7970267">We agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.974" offset="7975491">We are accused, of course, of saying, as is the Second Circuit accused of saying, that the language is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.845" offset="8002972">As far as it goes, the language is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.464" offset="8013421">First of all, section 304(c)(6) says that all of a particular author's rights that were covered by the termination, terminated grant, revert to the author or as, in this case where the author is deceased, to his heirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.742" offset="8078518">Second of all, the derivative works exception is very slain on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.046" offset="8103804">It says a derivative work prepared under authority of the grant before its termination may continue to be utilized under the terms of the grant after its termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.603" offset="8146018">Now, contrary to Mill's argument, the Second Circuit did not miss the point here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.357" offset="8177052">It flatly observed that the real problem with the exception language is that it was designed to apply to a one-step grant only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.149" offset="8216235">That is to say, a grant by the holder of the underlying copyright to someone who was a creator of what is known as a derivative work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.957" offset="8263465">I recognize that Mill dances evasively on what is meant by a utilizer and, of course, points our correctly that there is not the exact word "utilizer" in the exception, but it's perfectly clear that what we're talking about here is preserving the right, which is a copyrightable right, to someone such as a record company who takes an assignment from someone in the position of either the original copyright owner or, as in this case, Mills and uses the idea of the underlying song to create what is clearly a separately copyrightable work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.682" offset="8422289">That is what Congress wanted to protect, and all that is asked of this Court is to do what courts from time-honored beginnings have always done: to apply the clear intent of Congress to the facts of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.043" offset="8487804">Now, it is to be noticed also that Mills does not like to talk about the precise grants which are shown in the Joint Appendix in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.434" offset="8537333">First of all, what happened was, as the Court's questions illustrated now, originally Snyder sold to Mills the rights to the second 28 years in the original old statutory setup of 56 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.514" offset="8621656">Mills has gotten its full 56 years, and it certainly was not the intention of Congress, we say, when they added 19 years in the new statute to benefit authors, that there is anything in the statutory language here that gives one scintilla of a suggestion, let alone evidence, that Mills in its position, having bargained for the 56 years... and believe me, members of this Court, they knew how to bargain to get their value... when way back in the 1940s they agreed to a price with Snyder.</text>

            <text syncTime="2601.791" offset="10538730">Now, one of the points here which becomes very important in understanding what happened is to recognize, contrary to what we understand Mills, being prepared to argue not only here but in the court below, is the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.038" offset="10627755">And as you know, there's a great deal devoted in the Mills brief here and some significant part by us, the point being, as I understand Mills, that the legislative history, as they claim Judge Weinfeld found, is inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.314" offset="10688882">We dispute that, simply because if you analyze clearly what happened here, that beginning in the late '50s, the Copyright Office began to analyze the existing law and prepared first an initial report which came about in 1961, indicating that one of the problems under existing case law, under the old Act was a continuing and indeed growing doubt as to the ability to protect the rights of derivative works utilizers, particularly where there was a possibility of a reversion of the underlying copyright on a novel, for example, to the author or his heirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.032" offset="10903713">It is true that right from that beginning, there was this concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.686" offset="10926387">But the concern didn't really come to a point of issue until the 1963 draft was prepared in the Copyright Office, and there for the first time, Barbara Ringer, one of the principal... if not the principal... draftsmen of the statute, as a practical matter, did make it clear that the exception, pretty much as it's now in the law, would be a suggested way of taking care of this problem, of seeing to it that derivative works utilizers were protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.109" offset="11068075">And this was not an insignificant point, because under the old law, there were periods of time where very famous movies, for example, such as Gone With the Wind, Rear Window, and such were put on the shelves simply because it was commonly then thought by copyright lawyers that in the event of a reversion, these movies, for example, in other words would lose their copyright protection as derivative works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.794" offset="11186776">Now, it was this kind of thing that Congress certainly was aware of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.180" offset="11204330">And it's also, of course, true though that what happened was that most of the work, seriously in this whole area, was done in the Copyright Office, which not only is an arm of the Congress, but which was embodied in six booklets transferred to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.410" offset="11281235">Mills argues that since there is no dialogue, no colloquy on the floor of the House or in any of the committee sessions dealing with the reversion section and the exception, this means that Congress never understood this, never did anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.138" offset="11360124">Well, the fact is that they didn't do anything about it because the register of copyrights, when he submitted the volumes of the hearings which went on principally from '61 through '65, underscored the point that there was a compromise in respect to this business of the reversion and the exception thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.671" offset="11450299">So we argue, in short, that if you think what the state of the law was, how the people who were professionals understood the state of the law... and, by the way, two very articulate lawyers representing the publisher, Messrs. Abililes and Wattenberg, were the first to understand and consistently understood just exactly that this exception did not benefit or help publishers or middle men at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.590" offset="11565969">Therefore, we believe that what happened here was that, contrary to the suggestion of the district court, was that such legislative history as there is firmly supports the reading of the statutes which the Snyders have consistently taken here and in the court below; and furthermore, that it is a consistent position as a matter of plain language in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.871" offset="11663040">Let me emphasize that the Snyders do not agree with Mills that this is an ambiguous statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.391" offset="11693133">First of all, it seems perfectly clear just exactly what Congress is attempting to achieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.231" offset="11724480">The only thing that is at issue is to take the exception, apply its clear intent... and there is no doubt, as we argue it, that if you take the exception language, it applies very easily to a one transaction or one-step transaction, so long as the grantee is a derivative works utilizer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.596" offset="11825940">We also point out that this has nothing to do with the position that Mills finds itself in as an absolute free rider in terms of the objectives of the statutory language.</text>

            <text syncTime="3034.317" offset="12268872">You, sir, asked what was the source of our claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.304" offset="12292800">And I said, among other things, that the Snyders stand now in the shoes of Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.726" offset="12322475">Permit me to elucidate a bit and point out that is simply because of the reversion provision which we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.099" offset="12363958">The Snyders now own the copyright; Mills does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.919" offset="12387259">That's why in our brief, we go into the analogies to real estate transactions, patent law transactions, and other commercial transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.544" offset="12425816">As I put it this morning, the history of this thing is that the Snyders start out... when Snyder wrote the song in '23, he assigned the copyright to an old line firm in New York which went bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.553" offset="12485793">That meant that Mills picked up the rights to the copyright first term in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.890" offset="12515155">As Mr. Frankel pointed cut this morning, that meant thereafter that Mills owned the copyright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.330" offset="12544934">Here, we're talking about the underlying copyright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.598" offset="12557995">We're not talking about a derivative use copyright, as I'm sure you understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.119" offset="12584118">So it came to pass that when Congress passed the '76 Act and provided that there would be an extension of 19 years, bringing the total copyright period more in line with European countries and so on, and would give authors more protection that 75 years, the reversion provision necessarily followed, and hence it is that Snyder is once again the owner of the contract... of the copyright... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.169" offset="12692265">Now, that means that if you look at that source and then you look to the terms of the second grant, that is, the grants made by Mills to the music company, that is why we say those are still important because we do not agree with Mr. Frankel that there is some sort of dichotomy in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.369" offset="12785052">There isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.335" offset="12788918">Under the new copyright reversion section, all that has happened is that now Snyder is back, owning the underlying copyright, in the place of Mills, and should receive the 100 percent royalties provided for in the second grants to the derivative works utilizers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3468.213" offset="14004448">They frankly exposed this to all who will read or listen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.349" offset="14025032">They still continue to argue that there's only one grant, the terminated grant, which is the subject not only of the termination or reversion provision, but as well of the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.157" offset="14072262">And that language in the exception just can't bury that low.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.061" offset="14091801">So, ironically, what we come down to is this: Mills accuses the Snyders of obfuscating, distorting, in particular, distorting the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.036" offset="14139762">We argue that, as the Court of Appeals below held, the only way you're going to distort the language of the exception in particular is to follow the theory of the Snyders.</text>

            <text syncTime="3516.961" offset="14199426">So, to conclude, it's perfectly clear, if you look at the language and you look at the legislative history, that the real question in this case is answered by simply saying that Mills doesn't fit in the class designed to be a part of the exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="3708.749" offset="14966590">If the Court please, starting at the end of Mr. Tyler's presentation, of course we argue that the termination provision and the exception in the statute refers to only one grant, the terminated grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.174" offset="15028343">Of course, we recognize that there is a subgrant or license contemplated in the world that these people lived in by the grant from Snyder to Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.066" offset="15075886">In addition, we not only acknowledge but insist that in the world Congress addressed in this statute, multiple grants are the typical standard arrangement; not just two, but three, four, five, six, to financiers from creative people to financiers, to distributors, to exhibitors, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.413" offset="15165225">And when Congress wrote this exception to provide that the derivative works may be utilized under the terms of the grant, the terminated grant, what it was saying is, we can't visualize all the arrangements out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.857" offset="15231053">What we are doing for former derivative works is simply maintaining the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.695" offset="15254355">That's the fairest arrangement we can make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.480" offset="15265535">If the artist gave up the derivative work right for a lump sum in the past, the artist gets nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.217" offset="15296464">The status quo holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.253" offset="15304614">If the artist gave it up on the basis of 50/50 or 90/10, that holds under the terms of the terminated grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.524" offset="15341708">I think that's what we mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.793" offset="15346724">Now, I want to answer a question that I think came from both Justice O'Connor and Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.880" offset="15375145">Are we fighting about an academic subject?</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.516" offset="15389669">If we weren't here, and if the copyright had been extended as it had, derivative work owners would be infringing that copyright by surveying their derivative works unless they had authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.278" offset="15452676">So I'm quite sure that although my answer was inadequate before lunch, the reason they're happy to go along is that they need the license in order to be selling their records.</text>
