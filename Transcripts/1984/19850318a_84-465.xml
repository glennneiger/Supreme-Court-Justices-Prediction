            <text syncTime="9.972" offset="180326">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the respondent, Nicholas Romano, entered a plea of guilty in November of 1976 to two felony counts of the transfer and sale of a controlled substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.781" offset="235601">The record indicates that Romano had sought to trade 26 pounds of marijuana to a person who turned out to be an undercover police officer in exchange for heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.773" offset="287532">In April of 1977, after the preparation of a presentence investigation, a hearing was held before the circuit judge, the state circuit judge who had accepted Romano's guilty plea on the issue of sentence, and at that hearing Romano's attorneys presented testimony and evidence which sought to mitigate the offense and consequently keep Romano out of prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.122" offset="376975">After hearing this evidence, the court observed that he had labored with this case, as he had with any in which a person might be sent to prison, and the court also remarked that Romano's past track record was not very good.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.429" offset="426190">Nevertheless, the court said, because this was not a personal crime, a crime against a person, he was inclined to and would grant probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.285" offset="461612">So saying the court sentenced Romano to two concurrent terms of 20 years' imprisonment, suspended the execution of those terms, and placed Romano on probation for a term of five years, and at that time indicated to Romano that in all probability when that five years were up he would add a second five-year probation term for a total of ten years' probation on this offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.466" offset="550324">Two months after he was placed on probation, a car driven by Romano struck and seriously injured a young man outside the bar where Romano was employed as a bartender.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.023" offset="596508">Romano did not after the accident remain at the scene or identify himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.343" offset="613854">Instead, he absconded.</text>

            <text syncTime="561.676" offset="2387150">In Morrissey and Gagnon, this Court acknowledged a significant liberty interest in revocation and probation and parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.346" offset="2417870">And the court said, I think perfectly correctly, that there are two stages to a revocation decision, the first being whether a person is guilty of the alleged probation or parole violation, and the second is what this Court called the predictive and discretionary decision as to whether he should be sent to prison or what other disposition should be made of this person because of the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.459" offset="2502298">The Court stated that both of these questions involve factual bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.846" offset="2527898">Obviously, the first decision, the guilt decision is almost entirely factual, but even when one is talking about a decision on sentencing after one finds that a violation of probation has been committed, this Court said it is important to know not only that some violation was committed, but also to know accurately how many and how serious the violations were.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.343" offset="2613788">Thus, this Court established a framework, a procedural framework whereby the facts of the case, the facts pertinent to both these issues would be reliably and fairly determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.336" offset="2665824">This Court described the remedy, the procedure it was requiring under the due process clause in Morrissey as an informal hearing structured to assure that the finding of a parole violation would be based on verified facts, and that the exercise of discretion would be informed by an accurate knowledge of the parolee's behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.581" offset="2742833">And this Court expressly in Morrissey rejected the concern that this procedure that it was mandating would impair or affect the exercise of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.022" offset="2784525">It said, a simple factual hearing will not interfere with the exercise of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.991" offset="2800407">Yet that is exactly what the Eighth Circuit is doing in this case, and that is exactly what respondent demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.727" offset="2823395">There is not the slightest contention in this case that the facts of this matter were not adequately developed, that the state circuit court was not fully aware of all pertinent facts both pertaining to the person's guilt of the revocation and to enable him to make a decision as to what disposition should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.423" offset="2890164">Rather, what they are asking, and what the Eighth Circuit is saying can be done and should be done as a matter of federal constitutional law is that for the federal habeas court to look into the mind, based purely upon the record, of the state revoking judge or revoking authority and say that that court or authority did not use the right mental process in arriving at its conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.990" offset="2996430">And I submit respectfully that that is completely beyond the contemplation and beyond the policy that was stated by this Court in Morrissey and Gagnon.</text>

            <text syncTime="748.144" offset="3132998">It must say, I consider A, B, C, D, and E as alternatives to incarceration, and I don't think they are adequate because A, B, C, D, and E.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.500" offset="3170510">And again, that is... goes beyond the factual concerns that this Court had in Morrissey, and it goes to the question of the exercise of the Court's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.625" offset="3210948">Now, the respondent has very heavily relied upon one passage in this Court's decision in Morrissey, and it was in the early part of the decision, in Part 1 of the decision, in which this Court said, as I just mentioned before, that there are two states, the stage of determination of guilt of the violation and the decision on sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.937" offset="3288166">He has not only cited this over and over again, but he cited lower court state and federal cases that simply quoted the language, as if the language supports his conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.208" offset="3321289">The difficulty, the petitioners submit, is that this language was a purely factual statement in this Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.978" offset="3352427">It contained no constitutional holding or principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.016" offset="3368518">It is a correct factual statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.649" offset="3375101">Exactly the same thing could be said that this Court said in Morrissey about a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.270" offset="3397566">One could say that there are two stages in a criminal trial, a determination of whether the person is guilty of the offense charged, and if he is guilty whether he should be sent to prison or put on probation or whatever the alternatives may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.345" offset="3453886">Yet this Court has repeatedly recognized in cases too numerous... I can cite several, but this Courth has well established that as a matter of constitutional law one cannot review the sentencing discretion of the state court unless the sentence itself is inherently unconstitutional, or there is some other due process defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.876" offset="3543957">This Court has, in Roberts versus United States, United States versus Grayson, and other cases, has acknowledged that that area is not a constitutional question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1392.342" offset="5709821">On top of that, we submit, and the respondent has cited no cases, and we are not aware of any, in which this alternative, this requirement of consideration of alternatives to incarceration exists.</text>

            <text syncTime="1430.649" offset="5863108">And for reasons I have already discussed, we think it is completely out of line with what this Court has previously demanded in terms of due process of probation and parole revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.589" offset="5898843">There is one final reason why this holding should be opposed, and I think if respondent didn't benefit from this, the lower court's decision, I would think it would oppose it on the same grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.349" offset="5957880">The fact is, and as we have stated it is absolutely undisputed that there is, according to respondents' position and according to the decisions of the court below, they seek to create a disparity, a difference in burden between a sentencing decision after the original pleading of plea or finding of guilt and a sentencing decision after a revocation of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.712" offset="6043353">In fact, in doing so, they have created an additional risk, an additional concern for a state sentencing court in deciding to put someone on probation.</text>

I mean, every judge knows at the time of original sentencing that he has alternatives, and presumably... I mean, it is fair to presume he has always thought about different possibilities before he imposed the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.699" offset="6263304">But I think there are a lot of judges who think that a parole revocation automatically and necessarily leads to the imposition of the original sentence, because it happens so often, and we don't even know what the law is in Missouri.</text>

            <text syncTime="1731.393" offset="7065994">But the final point I would like to make is that this does create a greater risk, a greater concern for a court in deciding to put someone on parole, and I just would... I am amazed to hear this point advocated, because it would seem to me in close cases, and I submit this was a close case involving a decision on prison versus incarceration, this individual amazingly, even the presentence investigation recommended that he be incarcerated, that he not be placed on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.148" offset="7189083">He had committed a rather serious, rather large-scale drug offense, and his record, as the Judge said, was not very good.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.632" offset="7302977">So, we submit for all these reasons and under this Court's decisions in Morrissey and Gagnon, this decision of the Eighth Circuit should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1864.782" offset="7599624">This Court should require and should hold that the due process clause, the Fourteenth Amendment requires that trial judges should state on the record whether alternatives should be considered before revoking probation, and we submit that this Court should make this holding and follow this holding for three principal reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.915" offset="7700143">First, it is the precedent of this Court, a 12-year precedent in the landmark decisions of Morrissey versus Brewer and Gagnon versus Scarpelli.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.920" offset="7736192">In those cases this Court stated that alternatives to incarceration should be considered before a trial judge revokes probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.244" offset="7777465">We have cited numerous federal and state cases which have applied that rule, have it applied it consistently and uniformly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1920.952" offset="7824277">Mr. Cherrick, do you think then that Morrissey and Gagnon included a substantive requirement like that along with their procedural requirements?</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.724" offset="7863356">Justice Rehnquist, we believe that was part of the procedural requirement of Gagnon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.545" offset="7882686">Indeed, all the numerous cases which we have cited in our brief follow that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.897" offset="7904002">There is a two-step rule requirement in a revocation hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.365" offset="7925945">First is the issue of whether a probation violation existed, and second, if a violation is found, and this, of course, is the critical issue in this case, should the probationer be recommitted to prison or should other steps be taken to protect society--</text>

            <text syncTime="3578.944" offset="14456244">Just one point, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.796" offset="14463663">There has been some persistent questioning about what it is that respondent in the lower court expects in the way of findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.485" offset="14494383">Just in addition to what has been said and the questions that have been asked, I would like to direct the Court's attention to the District Court's opinion, and it says... and oddly the court says if this issue is raised there needn't be a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.560" offset="14550703">But if it isn't raised, the court says, the trial court must express a rudimentary explanation for the rejection of alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.082" offset="14584766">A record devoid of anything but a mere recital that alternatives have been considered and denied does not comport with justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.920" offset="14608172">So, I do dispute respondent's assertion that all one has to... this seems to be an open-ended requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.973" offset="14628339">Not only you cannot say, well, I considered alternatives, but you have got to say, by my inference, at least, that you considered a certain number of alternatives and presumably if someone comes up with some new ones later, like apologizing in the town square, that is going to be a violation of the Constitution.</text>
