            <text syncTime="65.358" offset="387872">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the issue presented for review this afternoon is, must the defendant give up his right not to testify in order to preserve his right to appeal an erroneous ruling by the trial court admitting a prior conviction under Rule 609A of the Federal Rules of Evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="85.939" offset="470210">The context in which this case arose is by way of a motion in limine filed in the United States District Court in Memphis.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.776" offset="501557">In his motion, the defendant firmly indicated a desire to testify in his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.830" offset="525799">The issue was briefed, and the relevant case law cited to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.983" offset="542412">After argument, both the government and defendant moved for a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.119" offset="562997">The trial court definitively held that a defendant may testify on the issue of flight, absent impeachment by way of the prior conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.708" offset="597374">However, if the defendant were to testify on any substantive issues in the case, the evidence of the prior conviction could then be admitted against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.266" offset="635513">The rationale behind the court's ruling was simply that the earlier conviction, first, involved a crime of moral turpitude, and secondly, that it was a felony.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.116" offset="842925">And again, the trial court ruled, this time in a written opinion, that the previous conviction was a felony involving moral turpitude, and therefore would be proper impeachment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.875" offset="894021">On appeal, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, stating in part that, since the defendant had failed to testify and suffered the impeachment, he could not now complain of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.283" offset="951594">In this case, the defendant should not have been required to waive his constitutional right to remain silent in order to preserve a ruling which is patently wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.490" offset="988479">The right to remain silent or to testify is a fundamental right of all defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.775" offset="1009586">It is, more importantly, a personal right to each defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.370" offset="5411950">The trial judge is in the best position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.642" offset="5453015">The single most important evidence to a defense case is the defendant's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.296" offset="5475689">Its force and effect on the course of the trial is well-recognized by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.116" offset="5494915">Often times, without it, the defense can only argue that the government did not prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.203" offset="5527307">With it, they are armed with a direct denial of the accuser's accusations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.024" offset="5550608">It is also fair to say that the most significant factor in determining whether a defendant will testify is whether or not this prior conviction is admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.630" offset="5584985">This, as Justice Marshall has noted, is certainly one of the crucial points in determining whether a defendant will or will not take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.553" offset="5620721">On the one hand, the government does not need this evidence to prove its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.457" offset="5636290">It is merely general impeachment of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.492" offset="5648411">On the other hand, the defendant would be reluctant to testify in the face of this devastating impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.645" offset="5677041">The balancing considerations clearly favor the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.680" offset="5693237">We further hold that the conduct of the entire defense case will be altered because of the introduction of the general impeachment, and the defendant must either be coerced to testify to preserve error in the point, or remain mute and waive his right to appeal an erroneous ruling would be intolerable and fundamentally unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.678" offset="5773172">To further suggest the defendant's testimony may not be relevant is unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.348" offset="5799921">Anything a defendant says is important to the tryer of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.485" offset="5816430">In virtually every case, the jury would want to hear from the defendant himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.222" offset="5839418">The more sensible approach, we submit, is that what a defendant says is relevant and pertinent, especially to his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.995" offset="5874422">We also submit that if a motion such as this is made, it is made in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.963" offset="5894380">The defendant indeed intends at that point to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.517" offset="5908590">If there is reason to question a defendant's willingness to testify or the motives in filing of the motion, the government, of course, may address itself to this issue in response to the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.623" offset="5952999">Also, to suggest that trial courts will not be able to rule on these motions is without merit, since they have been ruling on these issues for years, and in virtually every circuit, as we had pointed out earlier, except the Sixth, review is permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.882" offset="6010050">I will reserve the remaining time, unless there are more questions, for rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce M. Kuhlik</label>
            <text syncTime="1480.172" offset="6047144">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, petitioner seeks review of an advisory evidentiary ruling when the evidence was never actually offered or admitted at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.830" offset="6101792">The Court of Appeals in this case determined that in that circumstance, the petitioner had failed to preserve his claim of error for appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.519" offset="6136587">And I would like to suggest that the facts of this case show vividly why that rule is an appropriate one in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.776" offset="6177547">Petitioner made his motion in limine on the second day of trial, before the government had rested, while the government was still putting on its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.115" offset="6218925">Petitioner stated in the motion that he intends to testify in his own behalf; did not state that he intended to testify only if his motion were granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.973" offset="6266363">He did not lay out any testimony that he wished to give, and has never done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.794" offset="6289665">The court's ruling on the motion, to the extent that it can be identified, is set forth in the Joint Appendix at pages 21 and 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.463" offset="6324355">And I think it bears close scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.232" offset="6335431">The court stated that if the petitioner testified concerning his flight to avoid arrest, his flight from the arresting officers, then the court would keep the impeachment evidence out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.044" offset="6402618">The court then went on to say if, on the other hand, petitioner testifies about drugs,</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.762" offset="6425501">"I've never had any prior drug involvement. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.900" offset="6438040">then I'll let the impeachment evidence in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.583" offset="6448803">And I take it, petitioner has no quarrel with either of those rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.654" offset="6465103">Certainly, petitioner does to quarrel with the proposition that the evidence would not come in if he testified concerning the flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.325" offset="6499794">Moreover, in his brief on pages 14 through 15, petitioner states that, if indeed he did testify that he had no prior drug involvement, the impeachment would clearly be proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.550" offset="6548695">What is it, then, that petitioner seeks to review on appeal?</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.537" offset="6568652">He has never offered any sort of evidence that he wished to present, that he was precluded from presenting by the court's ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.727" offset="6605433">Moreover, the very fact that the district court looked to the substance of what petitioner would testify to in determining how it would rule on the motion, demonstrates that the court was, in fact, applying the balancing test that is required under Rule 609, and it demonstrates a more general point under that rule as well; that the court cannot make its final intelligent, informed ruling under Rule 609 until it has in front of it the defendant's actual testimony, until it has seen what the defendant has to say and seen how his demeanor and his credibility have been demonstrated before the jury.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce M. Kuhlik</label>
            <text syncTime="2293.276" offset="9299598">That is the narrowest ground on which you could decide the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.728" offset="9313390">I would suggest that the Court of Appeal rule is the best one and should be adopted by the Court, but the Court certainly need not go that far to uphold the judgment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.369" offset="9359993">I would like to stress a few points in response to petitioner's points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.604" offset="9380891">The first is that, there is clearly no right under the Constitution or under the rules to an advanced ruling of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.843" offset="9413910">Courts are well within their discretion to refuse to rule on them, and they do it quite often.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.882" offset="9445988">And it differs significantly from motions to suppress, for example, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.453" offset="9476290">Perhaps the most important is that a motion to suppress can be decided without trial of the general case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.373" offset="9503980">You're talking about a motion to suppress a ruling of law which can be clearly decided before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.927" offset="9530207">Here, on the other hand, you're talking about a district court's exercise of discretion under the rules, balance and probative value, prejudicial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.068" offset="9570749">These things are quintessentially things that the court can only finally determine at trial and, for that reason, there is clearly no right to an advanced ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.024" offset="9614634">I would also emphasize that Rule 609 itself is not of constitutional magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.478" offset="9640443">Even where there is error, it's not... it does not rise to the level of due process, simply because a conviction is admitted into evidence in violation of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.754" offset="9689554">And I would remind the Court as well that limiting instructions are available on the proper use of this impeachment evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.693" offset="9725289">The rule adopted by the court below, requiring that evidentiary claims be preserved only where the evidence is actually offered at a trial, has several benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.155" offset="9795088">I've touched on some of those already.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.038" offset="9802612">One of the most important is that it makes for a clear showing of actual prejudice to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.659" offset="9829152">Where the evidence is actually admitted, you have the defendant taking the stand, you can see the relevance of his testimony, you give the government a chance to decide in light of the defendant's testimony, and not merely in light of his pretrial proffer, either through counsel or through voir dire, to decide whether to offer the evidence or, in the middle of trial, to decide perhaps that the defendant's testimony is so weak and the government's tastes so strong, that it need not risk a reversal because it is far more likely to convict, even without the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.886" offset="9990066">You give the district court one last chance to decide the motion finally, when the evidence is offered at the right time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.575" offset="10020786">This allows the court the opportunity, the appeals court, to clearly identify the ruling that it's reviewing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.062" offset="10046700">I have suggested here that the district court's ruling was simply a denial or a grant of the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.065" offset="10074703">In fact, it was rather complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.101" offset="10082853">The court attempted to step into the vacuum created by petitioner's failure to proffer any evidence, and suggest if you testify this way, I'll rule this way; if you testify that way, I'll rule another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.027" offset="10142621">Petitioner may suggest a broader reading of the district court's ruling here, but when you are reviewing the ruling admitting the evidence at trial, its far simpler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.585" offset="10192881">The Court of Appeals need not guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.187" offset="10199255">It's got the ruling right there, it knows what it is reviewing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.473" offset="10216391">Finally, note that reviewing the rulings only when the evidence is actually offered at trial makes the job of the Court of Appeals in determining whether any error is harmless, far simpler.</text>

            <text syncTime="2706.872" offset="10953985">The only risk, the only real risk at the present, I would suggest, is that defense counsel might inaccurately predict how the Court of Appeals would come out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.228" offset="10999438">If defense counsel believes that a ruling admitting the evidence would be upheld on appeal, then the path is clear; the defendant does not take the stand.</text>
