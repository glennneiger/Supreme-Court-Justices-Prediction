            <text syncTime="97.625" offset="521295">In effect, this means that a Vermont resident who goes to Illinois and buys a car, pays an Illinois tax of 7 percent, comes back to Vermont and registers the car there, pays no tax to the State of Vermont.</text>

            <text syncTime="1198.265" offset="4923868">I think that even apart from the discrimination, the tax violates the commerce clause because even if, as Justice White suggested, the discrimination was removed and everyone who bought a car in another state had to pay a 4 percent tax to Vermont which is the case in four other states right now, in that case everyone would face a substantial incentive to buy their car in Vermont for tax reasons alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="2617.577" offset="10601113">It doesn't except the administration, the actual administration of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.944" offset="10630579">The tax is administered by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.757" offset="10645834">And the problem in this case is that section 8911(9) talks about the credit being available to a resident and upon the application for registration, which brings into question, or brings into the case the other statutes which are in pari materia, the state's registration statutes and the state's residency laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.798" offset="10729948">And when the statutes are put together, as the Commissioner has interpreted and as it has been argued to the Vermont Supreme Court, the credit is only available if the resident first registers the car in the State of Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.298" offset="10779999">And I think the logic is plain because if the resident, if the purpose of the credit provision is simply to enable the Vermonter to make a quick trip to another state to make a purchase and to return to Vermont to use the car in Vermont, as the Court pointed out before, it's unlikely that a resident of Vermont is going to make a shopping trip in another state and then actually register the car in the state in which it is purchased.</text>

            <text syncTime="2841.864" offset="11498262">And that's what the legislature was envisioning when it enacted this credit provision, to simply enable the Vermonter to make the quick trip, come back to Vermont, and register the car in Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.041" offset="11534938">In the case where the resident first registers the vehicle in the other state and then returns to Vermont and registers the car in Vermont, he is not extended a credit, and justifiably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.438" offset="11580495">In that situation, the individual has acquired the privilege of using the vehicle in several states, in two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.794" offset="11609961">And it's only fair that if he is going to use... or if he's obtained this privilege, that he should pay each state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.397" offset="11640368">The Court has long recognized that the use tax is a legitimate means of raising revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.271" offset="11659803">And the State of Vermont is certainly within its authority to ask the Appellants in this case, once they become residents of the state, to pay the use tax.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew M. Eschen</label>
            <text syncTime="3087.785" offset="12481929">But I submit that the decision has been made by the court, and that under Vermont law the Commissioner's interpretation has been accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.592" offset="12525083">The privileges and immunities challenge, I believe, is also without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.315" offset="12540025">Again, the tax was imposed only after the Appellants became residents of the State of Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.099" offset="12571163">The interesting issue in this case is simply the right to register a motor vehicle or the access to registering a motor vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.197" offset="12603555">They are in essence challenging the laws of their own state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.918" offset="12618393">Prior to becoming residents, they did not have any obligation to pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.312" offset="12640022">The tax was incurred only when they became residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.755" offset="12653815">So I would submit that there is a question of standing as to whether they could challenge it under the privileges and immunities clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.946" offset="12678579">But even if they could, again the interest in this case is certainly not an interest of the same caliber as the Court has recognized in other privileges and immunities cases... Hicklin... we're not dealing with a right to seek employment; we're not dealing with a fundamental right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.301" offset="12756006">This is simply the right to register an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.233" offset="12767708">And I think the case of Baldwin v. Fish and Game Commission of Montana would be dispositive of that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.286" offset="12791950">The commerce clause issue I submit is also with merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.798" offset="12809922">The Appellants contend that there is a requirement of apportionment; yet, they hardly define what they mean by apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.013" offset="12842837">To the extent that they disagree with a tax based upon the value of a vehicle, the decision of the court in Capital Greyhound Lines v. Brice is dispositive of that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.011" offset="12882856">To the extent that they claim that apportionment is required to reflect prior use in the other state, I submit that the Vermont tax scheme whereby the vehicle is taxed on the value as of the time it is used in the State of Vermont, registered in the State of Vermont, would satisfy the requirement of apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.692" offset="12953491">It is a reasonable way of dealing with the situation where a vehicle has been used outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.716" offset="12977628">I would conclude, Your Honors, by saying that the statute is unclear and it was for that reason that it was submitted to the Vermont Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.945" offset="13026530">The Vermont Supreme Court concluded that there was no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.058" offset="13043039">I have made representations to the Court as to how this statute and the tax provisions are administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.661" offset="13065400">Those are based upon my discussions with the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles and other officials in the department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.534" offset="13092881">That is their representation of how it is administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.045" offset="13102912">I have no reason to disagree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.458" offset="13116600">I can very well appreciate the Court's concern about the Vermont Supreme Court's decision in not specifically addressing the scenarios that I have addressed to the Court today, but I would nevertheless submit that the interpretation that we have advanced is an interpretation that would show that there is equality of treatment by the State of Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.616" offset="13209178">Thank you.</text>
