            <text syncTime="15.760" offset="190137">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.628" offset="205602">In May of 1978, Carmen Edward, a Black female, was told that she could not register to vote because she had been convicted of the crime of issuing a worthless check which under state law is one involved moral turpitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.291" offset="284283">That decision to refuse her her vote was based upon the Constitution of 1901 and Section 182 which allows the disfranchisement of voters for conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.972" offset="371009">That specific crime is not on the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.823" offset="386369">The statutory offense for which she was committed, issuing a worthless check, did not become a statutory crime until 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.631" offset="429628">So, the justification for his disfranchisement would fit under the provision of the constitutional provision of 1901 which allows disfranchisement for those who commit any crime involving moral turpitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.074" offset="483336">A month later in June of 1978, Mrs. Edwards, along with a while male, Mr. Underwood, filed a complaint in the District Court alleging that Section 182 violated various rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.054" offset="575287">That complaint was later amended to include five causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.958" offset="594931">Three of the causes of action were disposed of in pre-trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.545" offset="617292">The case was tried on the cause of action that specific crimes had been added to Section 182 with the intent to disfranchise blacks and that the statute has had that effect presently.</text>

            <label>Mr. James S. Ward</label>
            <text syncTime="156.000" offset="751039">Your Honor, I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.452" offset="760861">There are non-felons disfranchised for commission of various election offenses which may or may not be a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.926" offset="806732">But, I am not aware of any specific state that allows blanketly at least that.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.966" offset="842990">I am sure there are some states that allow disfranchisement for misdemeanors depending on how the statute is written.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.785" offset="870261">If the state court would define a misdemeanor as being an infamous crime and the provision of law in that state allowed for that to happen, then I think, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.010" offset="915088">The District Court held that there was a failure on the part of the Appellees to show that 182 was passed with the intent to disfranchise blacks and also that even if that had been shown there was a permissible motive for Section 182 and, therefore, under Palmer and Michael M. the statute was allowed to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.626" offset="1009546">On Appeal the court below ruled as a matter of law that intent to disfranchise blacks have been shown by the inclusion of the certain crimes, those crimes being misdemeanors and crimes involving moral turpitude and that the Appellants here have failed to prove that there was a permissible motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.641" offset="1097631">It is the Appellants' contention now before this Court that Section 182 must be viewed and analyzed as it exists now, not as it existed 84 years ago when it was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.572" offset="1181328">Today the effect of Section 182 is as follows: The only crimes for which one can be disfranchised in our state are ones involving moral turpitude or which are a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.862" offset="1234513">No one can be disfranchised for the conviction of a misdemeanor in and of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.766" offset="1258128">It has to be a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude or a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.103" offset="1279443">All crimes on the list which do not involve moral turpitude are no longer good crimes in our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.193" offset="1315806">By various court decisions or decision of this Court, they have been stricken.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.347" offset="1336495">So, you are dealing now with a statute which, as it presently works, includes within its proscriptions those who have been convicted of a felony or one convicted of a moral turpitude crime and makes no distinction as to whether it is a misdemeanor or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.491" offset="1413086">If the crime involves moral turpitude, that is the disfranchising fractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.062" offset="1431372">That is the occurrence that allows the state to disfranchise, not its punishment as opposed to a felony or a misdemeanor.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.593" offset="1533458">I would be very blind and naive and try to come up and stand before this Court and say that race was not a factor in the enactment of Section 182; that race did not play a part in the decisions of those people who were at the constitutional convention of 1901 and I won't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.477" offset="1633037">My point is that the effect of the statute today could be and probably is based on reasons that are legitimate reasons that the state can consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.368" offset="1684550">If the difference in treatment is the result of those committing moral turpitude crimes or others or a certain class or group committing more felonies than others, then the answer to your question, Your Honor, is the effect or the numbers would not have anything to do with race.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.631" offset="1769605">If crimes were selected because there was proof that more than one group committed those crimes as opposed to another group, the answer to your question may be different The point is those crimes now viable all involve moral turpitude and to us the issue is whether the state 84 years later can have in operation a provision of law that disfranchises felons and moral turpitude offenders regardless of what the punishment is.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.477" offset="1940968">I believe that analysis is consistent with this Court's decisions in some such cases as Doyle, Arlington, and in Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.166" offset="1983705">The important factor there was to look at whether there could be a justification for the continued validity of a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.723" offset="2025919">In all those cases... In each one of those cases, there is an immediate decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.127" offset="2047548">A decision was made, it was challenged, and the parties knew immediately that that decision would be allowed to continue or would have to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.452" offset="2096867">Therefore, the factors that were considered in trying to determine whether that decision was valid or not were all there presently.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.189" offset="2127796">In this case, there is a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.724" offset="2137932">We have the inexorable problem of the passage of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.160" offset="2151724">This Act was not challenged until some 77 years after it was passed and here it is 84 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.080" offset="2183385">And, I read nothing in any of those cases, in the Doyle case, in the Arlington case, or Washington versus Davis that says this Court or any court can't consider the present-day factors or the present-day justifications for something in trying to determine whether the state would have a legitimate or valid motive for the passage of the complained of Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="756.618" offset="3153572">And, in Doyle this Court lists some of those things, where a confession is obtained which is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.038" offset="3187218">Later on it can be cured by an intervening time, so the cause of the confession therefore is not what it was when it started.</text>

            <text syncTime="925.044" offset="3827218">The point I am making is that should this state in this case be denuded of the ability to impose restrictions on the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.269" offset="3876119">The way the statute operates today other states would have the right to make those kinds of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.689" offset="3905794">I can't predict that if North Dakota did that and if it reached this Court what this Court would do, but it may could and if it could, then I would think that this state, Alabama, would have that same right.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.349" offset="3956472">Assuming that, and you must that the state has a right to disfranchise those who commit moral turpitude crimes, one wonders where that authority comes from.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.609" offset="4021465">It comes first from the Tenth Amendment, that the state has the right and a wide discretion of the rights to set qualifications for voters and to determine who is eligible to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.219" offset="4091995">As a matter of fact, in the Lassiter case, which was cited by this Court in the Richardson case, it states specifically that previous criminal record is a fact the state may take into account in determining whether someone is qualified to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.263" offset="4156152">We would submit to the Court that that kind of a previous criminal record which included a conviction of a crime involving a moral turpitude type crime would be a factor that the state could take into account and should be able to take into account pursuant to those powers and duties left to it by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.112" offset="4255522">If the Court is to say that per se a state does not have the right to disfranchise those who commit moral turpitude crimes without a showing that there is some other violation of the federal Constitution, they would be destroying in my opinion what the Tenth Amendment says and if the Tenth Amendment allows the states to control these types of matters and they can do so, then the states should be allowed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.898" offset="4370670">Secondly, this Court's opinion in the Richardson case, as is well know, the second section of the Fourteenth Amendment allows the state to disfranchise for participation in rebellion or other crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.698" offset="4473906">It affirmatively sanctions that and does not put the penalty provision of the rest of the provision on the state if disfranchisement is based on participation of rebellion or other crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.308" offset="4532315">This Court in reviewing the legislative history of Section 2, I feel, was careful to point out that there was little debate on what this section meant, that the interest of everyone was on another provision and that section means what it says, other crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.003" offset="4607130">Therefore, other crime could include the conviction of crimes other than a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.275" offset="4644224">I again turn to Lassiter because the Court in discussing the eventual holding of Richardson was cited Lassiter and specifically cited the language from Lassiter that allows the state to take into account in determining qualifications of voters previous criminal record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.391" offset="4732622">The analysis then is that the Fourteenth Amendment either, one, would allow disfranchisement for other crime and escape the penalties of the first section or that because the Fourteenth Amendment, the second section of the Fourteenth Amendment talks about other crimes, there has been created to the state a special area, a unique area, if you will, in dealing with voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.314" offset="4876296">The importance of saying rebellion or other crime in an amendment that was passed to help protect that very right, that is voting, seems to me to suggest that there is a special area of protection for the states and if the Court was not to accept that other crime means all crimes of any kind, then I would suggest that it would mean that in judging a statute based on the disfranchisement of crimes other than a felony, a lesser standard, a less strict standard that is used in voting cases on a general basis be used; that a strict scrutiny test not be used, but a rational basis test be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.045" offset="5067303">Now, there are some Appellate Court decision that adopt that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.782" offset="5090186">I could not find any decision from this Court that adopted that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.186" offset="5111816">We would urge that it would be consistent if the language of Section 2 and the citation to cases which talk about the states being able to decide what the qualifications are for voters and cite a Tenth Amendment case that at least this area, this area of voting has left a little more special special impact, a little more uniqueness to the states, a little broader latitude, if you will, in dealing with these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.889" offset="5234591">That is not to say that the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't apply at all, but it would apply on a less level than a strict scrutiny will.</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.688" offset="6281788">The Court of Appeals also indicated, I think in a footnote, that the statute was under-inclusive because sometimes that apparently it would be characterized at least by the Court of Appeals as crimes of moral turpitude are not included such as mailing pornography and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1560.887" offset="6370604">No, ma'am, it is not accurate for two reasons, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.422" offset="6380740">First of all, that mailing by... I can't remember, whatever it is, was not even a crime then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.777" offset="6414177">It became a crime in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.527" offset="6421177">Secondly, the argument goes we weren't trying to disfranchise all misdemeanors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.050" offset="6451270">We are just trying to disfranchise felons and moral turpitude offenders, misdemeanors or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.204" offset="6479901">So, the under-inclusive argument, to me, does not apply and misunderstands what we are trying to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.493" offset="6517099">We aren't trying to say that the state can select 18 misdemeanors and not select 18 others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.083" offset="6543430">And, the 18 they did not select were more serious than the ones that they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.784" offset="6558163">What we are saying is the threshold question is conviction of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude and then it is that, the moral part of it which is important, not if the penalty is one day or ten days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.162" offset="6627754">And, I think that analysis for that reason... the felonies... if you were to say a statute that disqualifies all felonies, there are some of those which is some states are not serious at all and in some states, of course, are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.089" offset="6691388">I think some states, if you pick some wool or something, you can be sent off as a felon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.760" offset="6718137">So, the fact that it is all felons, that same argument could apply there, that some felons... or crimes which are felons are just so unserious as compared to others it is an under-inclusiveness type thing there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1889.782" offset="7686235">The Appellants' brief even said that the entire Suffrage Article had the intention to disfranchise poor whites as well as blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.406" offset="7728658">Suffrage was one of the principal issues of the 1901 Constitutional Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.394" offset="7748616">Every time the issue came up, the debate centered on the relative effects of a particular provision on blacks and whites or among different groups of whites.</text>

            <text syncTime="2617.965" offset="10598888">The Supreme Court of Alabama has said it is a crime that is inherently evil and the Attorney General of the State of Alabama, in giving one of his opinions to a board of registrars, listing all the crimes that had been found to be crimes of moral turpitude, said, well, there may be some other crimes that are moral turpitude, it all depends on the moral standards of the judges who happen to be hearing particular cases.</text>
