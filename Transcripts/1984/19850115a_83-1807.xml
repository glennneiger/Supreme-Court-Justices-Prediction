            <text syncTime="65.395" offset="387244">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="68.066" offset="397902">This case, like the preceding case, also is governed by the Warsaw Convention as that convention is supplemented by the Montreal Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.625" offset="444191">Now, the question here is whether pre-judgment interest may be awarded in excess of the limitation of liability that is set forth in those agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.824" offset="480971">In this case, we unfortunately do have an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.760" offset="500720">In June of 1975, Eastern Flight 66 crashed short of the runway at Kennedy International Airport in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.147" offset="538232">As a result of that crash, approximately 91 cases were brought in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.643" offset="564250">These cases were consolidated in the Eastern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.156" offset="586297">They were consolidated for the purposes of pre-trial discovery and then a liability trial was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.794" offset="612837">Now, among these 91 cases were a number of cases involving passengers who were engaged in international carriage when the plane crashed.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.259" offset="662679">Now, as to these passengers... that is, those passengers who were engaged in international carriage... both the witness and the Montreal Agreement apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.534" offset="707819">Under those agreements, a carrier's liability is limited to $75,000 per passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.704" offset="744495">In these international cases, Eastern moved for partial summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.513" offset="771662">The basis of its motion was that partial summary judgment should be given in the form of an order that would limit Eastern's liability to $75,000 in the international passenger cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.867" offset="825161">In this particular case, the case involving Bernard and Odile Mahfoud, Eastern's motion was ultimately granted by the judge sitting in the Western District of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.660" offset="868315">The judge sustained Eastern's position, but he also sustained Respondent Mahfoud's position, which was that, even though the limitation of liability amounts to $75,000 pre-judgment interest may be awarded on top of that amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.751" offset="1048664">It's an effort to bring the Plaintiff's damages up to the date of judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="291.056" offset="1289827">On page 3 of our brief are the provisions of the Warsaw Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.740" offset="1324622">At page 4 is... sorry, 3 and 4 are the provisions of the Montreal Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.471" offset="1355551">We have attached as an appendix to this brief a more fuller statement of the Montreal Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.577" offset="1375926">It's sometimes more difficult to locate in the library than the Warsaw Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.982" offset="1397556">The Warsaw Convention here is the basic document.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.994" offset="1425664">It governs international air carriage among 120 signatory nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.180" offset="1446353">The Montreal Agreement, when it's applicable, is applicable because it simply makes two changes in the Warsaw Convention system.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.676" offset="1488357">The changes are that the Montreal Agreement raises the level or the limit of liability; and the second change is that the Montreal Agreement waives one of the carriers' primary defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.560" offset="1543946">It's the Article 20 defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.201" offset="1550424">Now, because the Montreal Agreement and the limit of liability in that agreement is an extension of the limit of liability found in the Warsaw Convention, it's appropriate to look first at the language of the Warsaw Convention, and the special language of limitation in that convention is found at page... or at Article 22.1, and that is at page 3 of our opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.658" offset="1664318">Now, Article 22.1 contains three sentences, and the first sentence limits the carrier's liability to a fixed sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.418" offset="1711339">The second sentence then goes on to create a narrow exception to that limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.963" offset="1733490">The exception is for those nations that require defendants to make periodic payments to the plaintiff rather than making a lump sum payment to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.538" offset="1775809">And then the third sentence provides a means for raising the level of the limit, and that means is by special contract between the carrier and the passenger.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.252" offset="1966712">The courts in Louisiana, particularly the Fifth Circuit... I'm sorry, the district court in Louisiana... noted that there had been considerable passage of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.436" offset="2007358">The point that the court said that we had been dilatory about was that we had raised an objection to a motion for summary judgment, but our objection was sustained in the Court of Appeals, the Second Circuit sitting, to determine that our position was in fact the correct one.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.537" offset="2079770">I think the fundamental point to grasp here in terms of the delay is that Eastern answered this complaint approximately six weeks after it was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.502" offset="2119685">At that time we said that the Warsaw Convention and the Montreal Agreement limit our liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.171" offset="2146330">At any time from that point on, had the Plaintiff chosen, he could have moved for a complete summary judgment asking the carrier to pay the sum of $75,000, and that would have extinguished the liability that Eastern had to that Plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.195" offset="2222398">That motion for complete summary judgment was never made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.552" offset="2239848">The Warsaw Convention, its limitations on liability, were pressed by the carrier, not by the Plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.049" offset="2269837">I wanted to return now to the first sentence in Article 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.483" offset="2299616">Now, that sentence states that in the transportation of passengers the liability of the carrier for each passenger shall be limited to the sum of 125,000 francs.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.259" offset="2354682">Now, it's important to consider here what the drafters of this sentence did.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.023" offset="2373699">First of all, they did not place the limit on a certain part of the Plaintiff's recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.239" offset="2402643">Rather, they wrapped the limit around the concept of the carrier's liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.784" offset="2424795">Now, I want to reach now beyond this first sentence a bit to discuss this idea of liability in terms of the convention as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.842" offset="2465024">The concept of liability that is referred to in the first sentence is a liability that is to be determined by a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.541" offset="2499819">It's the liability of the carrier at the time the Plaintiff's claim is reduced to a liquidated sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.445" offset="2531479">That is normally when the Plaintiff's claim is reduced to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.475" offset="2543600">The Warsaw Convention in its many parts, first of all it creates forums for the Plaintiff, jurisdiction in certain national courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.548" offset="2583828">Second, it creates liability for the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.078" offset="2602010">Third, it creates defenses for the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.672" offset="2612354">Fourth, it incorporates national law to determine the amount of damages that may be due to the Plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.543" offset="2639835">The upshot is that this convention, the basic purpose of the convention, the basic effect of the convention, is to create liability and to bring that liability to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.865" offset="2697095">And it's that liability that is covered by the limit found in Article 22.1, the first sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.034" offset="2729801">Now, we get confirmation of that position from the second sentence in Article 22.1.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.719" offset="2764491">The second sentence we believe again confirms that the liability that must be limited is the carrier's liability at the time of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.432" offset="2807332">I would like to read the second sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.479" offset="2815587">Its text is that:</text>
            <text syncTime="674.321" offset="2822901">"Where, in accordance with the law of the court to which the case is submitted, damages may be awarded in the form of periodical payments, in that event, the equivalent capital value of said payments shall not exceed 125,000 francs. "</text>
            <text syncTime="693.142" offset="2898238">--125,000 francs, of course, being the limit fixed in sentence one.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.374" offset="2915166">Now, this second sentence is the only sentence in the convention that speaks to the time value of money and also of the limitation on liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.948" offset="2961455">Now, what the second sentence does is it expressly authorizes national courts to order carriers to pay out more than 125,000 francs if they do it over a period of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.958" offset="3013490">But the sentence makes plain that the limit... that is, the limit contained in the first sentence... requires that these payments not exceed the capital value of 125,000 at the date of the award.</text>

            <text syncTime="794.148" offset="3302196">Now, I want to direct the Court's attention then to another article of the convention, and that is Article 24.2.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.893" offset="3337200">This article appears at page 4 of the reply brief, and in this article the drafters of the convention have undertaken to remind national courts that they may not apply their local laws regarding damages in a way that places some of the recovery outside of the limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.996" offset="3417657">Article 24.2 states... and I'm going to interpolate here because the cross-referencing is very cumbersome.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.165" offset="3450362">But Article 24.2 states that in the cases covered by Article 17... that is, cases involving death or bodily injury... any action for damages, however founded, can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits set out in this convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.280" offset="3542731">In other words, this is the gentle reminder back to the national courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.840" offset="3564988">Don't rework your damage concepts, your damage laws, in a way that attempts to circumvent the limit of liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="886.957" offset="3673448">First, you have to determine the law that is to be applied, and it's the law of the court to which the case is submitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="907.979" offset="3757562">But then, more particularly in response to your question, it refers to damages being awarded in the forum of periodic payments.</text>

            <text syncTime="931.860" offset="3853066">I kind of thing that's the issue in the case, whether or not it's correct to insert the words "from the date of judgment".</text>

            <text syncTime="955.350" offset="3947002">I looked into the rest of the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.943" offset="3957451">It conceives of a claim that is being brought to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.941" offset="3977409">The idea of liability itself must be liquidated, it must be reduced to a sum certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.734" offset="4016593">When you have a limit such as they designed here, a limit of 125,000 francs, the limit is not applicable... that is, it's not able to be applied... until you know the amount of the Plaintiff's claim or the amount of the carrier's liability, that is, since it's the limit on liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.069" offset="4097886">And this convention then provides the means for determining the liability in a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.848" offset="4121082">So it's reading a number of provisions together, plus the specific language in the second sentence that speaks of awards or awarding damages, that leads me to believe that the critical point for determining the value of the limit is the time of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.529" offset="4195793">Now, what we conclude from the text of the Warsaw Convention is that it... first of all, it covers all elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.456" offset="4283459">That is, the limitation on liability covers all elephants of the Plaintiff's recovery against the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.657" offset="4304253">And second, as I mentioned to Justice Stevens, the limit fixes the carrier's maximum liability as of the date of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.669" offset="4348348">Now, the lower court in its ruling that pre-judgment interest can be awarded over and above the limitation of liability is inconsistent with this reading of the Warsaw Convention that I have tried to give to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.520" offset="4427760">I want to turn now to the text of the Montreal Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.409" offset="4443329">We think the text the Montreal Agreement confirms the fact that pre-judgment interest cannot be awarded over and above the limit of liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1177.478" offset="4835584">Now, the way to prove this point textually, I think, is by looking at the model notice that is contained in the Montreal Agreement, and that is at page A-3.</text>

            <text syncTime="3089.054" offset="12481833">Again, but if he didn't pay it, if it's a death case, he was liable at the time of death for $75,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="3111.186" offset="12570441">We're saying that the amount accrues at the time of the death, and if you pay it seven years later you pay interest on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.932" offset="12609415">If it were only an injury amounting to $5,000 and you didn't pay it for seven years, you would pay interest on the seven years, over that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.802" offset="12648913">I might say that the Respondent here never did oppose the Warsaw limit, as intimated by Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.921" offset="12709308">Franklin Mint was mentioned to the district court after it was handed down in a slip opinion, to show that this was an other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.245" offset="12758627">Franklin Mint could never have been used in this case by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.023" offset="12785794">It was prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.242" offset="12790601">It had no bearing whatsoever here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.801" offset="12808886">And I might say that, on the other side of the coin, Eastern Air Line depended upon the Domangue case, which is the basis for this decision in the Mahfoud case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.186" offset="12874402">I might conclude by saying that denying pre-judgment interest in this case would fail to effect any purpose of the convention's framers or signatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.744" offset="12916615">The decision of the district court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, ensures that a Warsaw-Montreal recovery is not diminished by the simple strategy of delaying payment until the award diminishes in value.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard M. Sharp</label>
            <text syncTime="3221.344" offset="13011074">I wanted to try briefly to clarify some of the facts relating to how this litigation was handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.060" offset="13037928">There were 92 cases at the high water mark in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.620" offset="13056109">When the case was fixed for liability trial on September the 18th, that number had been reduced to 54.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.243" offset="13090591">On September the 18th, 1978, 18 of the 54 cases were international cases of the Warsaw-Montreal variety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.145" offset="13134268">36 were domestic cases that were going to be tried on the ordinary issues of damages and negligence outside the Warsaw Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.547" offset="13171884">The trial counsel for Eastern was prepared for a six weeks liability trial on issues of whether the air traffic controllers and the like had caused the crash, when the Plaintiffs on the day of trial... that is, the Warsaw Plaintiffs... and in some cases on the preceding day to trial orally moved for summary judgment, for partial summary judgment in the sum... I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.301" offset="13286823">They did not ask for $75,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.267" offset="13294764">They just asked orally that Eastern be declared liable to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.984" offset="13317543">Eastern did not say it was not liable for the accident under Warsaw, but it said that it was not liable to them, to the Plaintiffs; that there was an individual... there was a dispute of fact over who should be the Plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.087" offset="13385984">The reason for that was that in almost half of the international cases there were more than two human beings that were contesting for the position of representing the estate or of bringing the wrongful death claim against the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.706" offset="13448468">Eastern was reserving its position so that it would be liable to the proper Plaintiff and not also be liable to the improper Plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.609" offset="13480129">In the Mahfoud case there was not a contest, but the papers did not show that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.855" offset="13505102">Counsel is faced with 15 different oral motions for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.761" offset="13524746">He takes the position, I would like to have that in writing, as Rule 56 entitles me to have it in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.025" offset="13549719">I would like to have ten days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.570" offset="13559959">In ten days he can pull together the facts and determine whether there is in fact a dispute with Mahfoud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.644" offset="13588276">That was never done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.957" offset="13593500">Now, the issue of summary judgment was revisited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.753" offset="13608651">It was revisited approximately a year later in proceedings to amend the summary judgment, and at that point... at that point the Plaintiffs moved to amend the summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.948" offset="13669464">Eastern urged the trial judge to decide the issue of capacity now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.134" offset="13690153">The trial judge did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.634" offset="13700184">The Plaintiff's counsel for Mahfoud at page 41 proffered an affidavit... this is 41 of the joint appendix... proffered an affidavit, and in the affidavit they suggested that any summary judgment against Eastern make clear that Eastern is not precluded by the judgment from raising its defense of lack of capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.639" offset="13796210">In other words, we're trying to get the legal issues solved and they are making clear that the legal issues are reserved for another day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.120" offset="13826095">Now, I disagree with Mr. Farrell on the point concerning whether Mahfoud ever contested the application of the limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.288" offset="13862770">There is a four-page brief in the record at pages 902 to 906... it's in the unprinted portion of the record before the Court... in which Mahfoud urges the district court to declared that the limit is unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.345" offset="13918986">I want to make two other points, and that is that counsel for the Plaintiff quite properly mentioned, after the Warsaw Convention it became evident, at least to some of the drafters at Hague and Montreal, it became evident that some courts were applying legal fees and costs above the limit, and in that event--</text>
