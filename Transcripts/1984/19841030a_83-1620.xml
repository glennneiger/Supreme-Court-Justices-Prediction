            <label>Mr. Charles T. Zink</label>
            <text syncTime="12.078" offset="174992">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.870" offset="186173">This case involves a conflict between the state taxing law and a federal statute limiting state taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.157" offset="219296">Georgia had a bank share tax, which was measured by net worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.659" offset="237268">The federal law revised at statutes, Section 3701, limits the state taxation in federal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.753" offset="269660">The question before the Court is whether the taxing formula adopted by the Georgia Supreme Court considers or takes into account federal obligations in violation of Section 3701.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.052" offset="318875">This case is making its second appearance before the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.755" offset="333712">In 1980, the bank deducted federal obligations from its net worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.939" offset="354401">The Georgia Supreme Court denied any deduction for the obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.763" offset="373732">While that case was pending here, this Court decided the case of American Bank and Trust Company against Dallas County in 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.356" offset="412080">In American Bank, the Court decided that the amendment to Section 3701 that was enacted in 1959 required that there be a deduction of federal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.104" offset="459100">Consequently, the Court remanded this case to the Georgia Supreme Court for reconsideration in the light of American Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.580" offset="492955">On remand, the bank urged the Georgia Supreme Court that it be permitted to take a complete exclusion of the federal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.589" offset="537049">It urged that what the statute meant was that these be ignored and treated as nonexistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.792" offset="561814">Instead, the Georgia Supreme Court construed the Georgia bank share tax to require only a proportionate deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.749" offset="597654">It devised a formula, and that is set forth on page 5 of our brief, whereby the percentage of federal obligations to total assets was determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.486" offset="640599">And in the example given, that was 9.75 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.589" offset="657004">It then determined that only 9.75 percent of the bank's federal obligations were present in its net worth, and its formula would permit a deduction of only that amount, some $200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.987" offset="718653">Thus, the formula adopted by the Georgia Supreme Court had the effect of reducing the deductions for federal obligations by a factor of almost 10 from approximately $2 million to $200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.138" offset="775182">Because the taxing formula did not exclude or ignore federal obligations, but instead considered them and took them into account in the computation of the tax, the bank appealed the decision to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.217" offset="831502">We feel the decision below should be reversed for at least three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.610" offset="853131">The plain meaning of Section 3701 requires a complete and not a limited exclusion of federal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.666" offset="889285">It requires that they be treated as nonexistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.088" offset="902973">The legislative history of the statute shows that Congress intended for there to be a complete exclusion, and the rationale of the court below, if permitted to stand, would limit the protection for exempt obligations provided by the statute for all taxpayers and for all types of taxes in clear violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.152" offset="991267">Now the language of Section 3701 reflects its purpose: to make federal obligations tax free as far as state taxes are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.648" offset="1029301">The idea is that an individual, a corporation, or a bank can purchase federal obligations and know that the purchase will not be affected by state taxes in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.598" offset="1081023">The Georgia formula, by contrast, if there's a contribution of federal obligations to capital, or if a bank purchases federal obligations from earnings, the tax increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.446" offset="1136403">Now those consequences cannot be reconciled with the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.118" offset="1155107">In American Bank, the Court determined that the exemption contained in the statute as amended was sweeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.083" offset="1183005">The Court went on in that case to hold that the statute did away with the inquiry to whether the tax was on an asset, and replaced it with the inquiry whether the obligations are considered in the computation of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.202" offset="1239430">The Court said in American Bank that "considered" for this purpose means "taken into account" or "included in the accounting".</text>
            <text syncTime="285.929" offset="1270359">Within that framework, I would like to examine what the majority of the Georgia Supreme Court did in its formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.564" offset="1292929">It added in the value of the bank's federal obligations in computing total assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.498" offset="1320618">It took them into account a second time as the numerator of the fraction used to determine the portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.385" offset="1352174">And they were taken into account a third time as a component of net work to which the fraction was applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.329" offset="1375998">By the time the Georgia Supreme Court got to deducting the federal obligations from the tax base, 90 percent of the federal obligations had disappeared, and they permitted only a deduction for 10 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.871" offset="1434199">We submit that the formula clearly takes into account, at least indirectly, the federal obligations that constitute a part of the bank's assets, a procedure which this court held in American Bank is impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.642" offset="1489265">We respectfully submit that you avoid consideration of federal obligations only when you exclude them or threat them as nonexistent, and that the states must exclude them from total assets before determining net assets and taxing net worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.622" offset="1557183">Now the legislative history shows that this is exactly what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.246" offset="1579649">The taxing authorities have suggested that our method of taking them off the top and ignoring the obligations is itself a consideration, but clearly that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.674" offset="1621340">As shown in the Secretary of the Treasury's report in the House hearings and in the Senate Finance Committee's report, one impetus to the amendment to the statute in 1959 was the fact that Idaho had a tax, the 1933 Idaho Taxing Act, which included exempt income from federal obligations in gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.797" offset="1717889">Now the secretary noted at page 70 of the hearings that Idaho did purport to take the exempt income out of the net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.214" offset="1755505">Clearly there was no complete deduction, because if a full deduction were present from that formula, neither the secretary nor the Congress would have been concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="444.269" offset="1903776">Then there was another statute, or section in that taxing formula that said, well, to the extent that we can't include exempt income in your income, then you will lose a proportional part of your deductions against income based on the percentage of your exempt income to total income.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.717" offset="2445556">We feel that when you look at the legislative history and what Idaho was trying to do to gross income, that it's clear that what the secretary and the Congress had in mind in the amendment of 1959 was to take the exempt income in that case off of gross, and that's what they wanted to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="666.035" offset="2790790">But of course if they don't tax federal obligations, as for example Georgia's does not in its new tax act, then they don't have to worry about franchise taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.954" offset="2826525">In other words, a regular income tax which, as you know now that the banking law was changed in 1969 to permit banks to be taxed in more typical ways, lots of states are going just to a typical corporate income tax and are not trying to tax federal obligations in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.053" offset="2894862">Although the taxing authorities seek support for their position, in this Court's opinion in Atlas Life, United States against Atlas Life Insurance Company, the cases are wholly distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.493" offset="2952645">Atlas Life involved the destruction of the Life Insurance Company Tax Act of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.286" offset="2979812">In that Act, Congress imposed a tax on life insurance companies and allocated income from municipal securities on two accounts, the policyholder's account and the company's account.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.815" offset="3029967">The Act stated that the policyholder's account was not taxed, and it permitted a deduction from the company's account.</text>

            <text syncTime="802.317" offset="3335913">I think the combination of Section 3701 as amended in 1959, and American Bank, I think I could have stood up and said those two things and sat down.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.752" offset="3377709">The prohibition in the statute, Section 3701, is very direct, explicit, and as this Court determined in American Bank, sweeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.263" offset="3439671">The constitutional prohibition against the taxation is implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.395" offset="3456285">Atlas Life involved the question of whether the tax was on the asset, and that's the very test which this Court held in Atlas Life... I'm sorry, in American Bank, not to be appropriate in construing Section 3701.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.025" offset="3514800">Finally, the taxing scheme in Atlas Life was found by the Court not to wholly ignore federal exempt income.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.418" offset="3548341">And that is what is required in connection with 3701.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.412" offset="3564328">Now the states cannot create formulas that limit the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.545" offset="3580837">Section 3701 is not limited to banks, or to shares of banks; it protects federal obligations from taxation of any type and for all types of taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.374" offset="3628171">The consequences of the Georgia Supreme Court's error can go far beyond this bank and banks generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.888" offset="3658264">The rationale, for example, would permit a proportionate offset of expenses against exempt income.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.431" offset="3688357">Now that would clearly violate the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.774" offset="3701732">The Court said in American Bank that Section 3701, as amended, is inconsistent with implied exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.679" offset="3729422">As shown in the examples in the bank's brief, some states have adopted formulas that provide less than the complete deduction of federal obligations from the tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.356" offset="3772054">We respectfully submit that this is simply a replay of the Idaho type problem which Congress faced in 1959 when it amended the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.674" offset="3813327">We do not believe that Congress intended for this Court to have to evaluate each of these formulas on an individual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.080" offset="3843002">We feel that Congress intended in 1959 to stop the use of these formulas, and to deny the effectiveness of the exemption, and we feel that it did so in very plain and unmistakable words.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.617" offset="3889082">In short, we feel that any additional exceptions to Section 3701 should be adopted by Congress and not by the states, and that this case is controlled by the language of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="969.916" offset="4006320">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="975.609" offset="4029098">This case involves the application of a federal statute, Revised Statute 3701 as amended in 1959, which exempts federal securities from state taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.905" offset="4070267">By its terms, it applies to every form of taxation that requires federal obligations to</text>
            <text syncTime="991.468" offset="4092524">"be considered directly or indirectly in the computation of the tax. "</text>
            <text syncTime="995.902" offset="4110287">This Court, in American Bank, characterized the scope of that exemption as a sweeping one, and defined the words "considered" to mean included in the accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.568" offset="4144978">It seems to me that there can be little doubt that the proportionate deduction method engrafted onto the Georgia bankshares tax by the State Supreme Court in this case violates the express terms of Revised Statute 3701.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.256" offset="4199730">Indeed, I do not see where the state explains how the statute is to be interrupted in a way that makes their tax computation lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.344" offset="4240063">Their argument seems to be that the word "considered" cannot mean what it seems to mean because federal obligations would be considered in any tax system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.450" offset="4284471">But that's really not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.230" offset="4291577">The proposal of the government, and of the appellants here, that the amount of federal obligations be excluded at the outset of the tax computation, does not require any consideration of federal obligations at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.211" offset="4355525">If given a list of assets and liabilities of the bank, the accountant can simply add up all the taxable assets of the bank, subtract the liabilities, and is then left with the net worth figure that serves as the tax base for the bankshares tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.301" offset="4415920">Now the consideration of the federal obligations that the state uses in this case is not a kind of technicality that brings it under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.481" offset="4468582">It goes to the very heart of the purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.853" offset="4482062">Under the system of proof below, the amount of the tax increases as the level of federal obligations increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.997" offset="4510692">And to some extent, this method undermines the tax exempt status of the securities, and therefore their marketability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.382" offset="4536187">In fact, it seems fairly apparent that the Georgia legislature itself recognized that a full exclusion from that net worth is the appropriate way to preserve a tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.421" offset="4580387">And therefore, conversely, that the proportionate deduction method used by the court here in fact does tax the item in question to some degree.</text>

            <text syncTime="1258.415" offset="5160305">The Georgia statute has an exemption for real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.859" offset="5178068">The reason for that... and real estate is entitled to a full exclusion, the same exclusion we argue as required here for federal taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.133" offset="5207221">Now the reason for that exclusion of course is that real estate is taxed separately under other provisions of Georgia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.516" offset="5236687">But it seems to me that if Georgia really believed, the Georgia legislature really believed that their proportionate deduction method that they have here does not impose any tax on the federal obligations, then they ought to have the same proportionate deduction method for real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.546" offset="5296873">In fact, they don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.069" offset="5302934">They allow full exclusion for real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.470" offset="5312547">If their position in this case were correct, they're really giving a kind of an extra windfall to banks that hold real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.475" offset="5340550">They're allowing them to shelter other income with the real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.206" offset="5351521">That's what they argue is true with federal obligations, but it seems like they don't really believe that, because in fact there is this full exclusion for real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.590" offset="5380987">I just point out that the state hasn't said anything about this in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.774" offset="5397810">I'm not sure what their answer to that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.825" offset="5405960">I would also like to emphasize that this case is not really restricted to the bankshare context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.720" offset="5433546">The state has made several arguments about, because of the nature of the banking business, they're going to buy federal obligations anyway, and this case doesn't really amount to very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.655" offset="5469281">I mean, there is a broad principle that's involved here, which is whether this proportionate deduction method in fact complies with the statute or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.379" offset="5500210">And if the state prevails in this case, there is a lot of opportunity for many other kinds of taxes, the treatment of those taxes to be changed by states which could, first of all, create a whole new host of problems in interpreting 3701 as to whether various kinds of proportionate deductions are in fact valid or not and would have a very substantial effect on the marketability of the United States securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.575" offset="5592997">Probably the most familiar example is to look at income taxes, either corporate income taxes or personal income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.873" offset="5634166">Many states have personal income taxes that are similar to the federal system, where there is a computation made of total income, and then deductions are allowed for certain expenses... mortgage interest expenses, charitable contributions, child care expenses, things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.264" offset="5703756">Now it has always been understood that the interest income on United States savings bonds or other federal securities are totally excluded from the computation of those state income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.703" offset="5753494">But in fact, under the position taken by the state below, if that's correct, there seems to be no reason why the state could not enact the same sort of proportionate deduction treatment of interest on federal bonds for income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.200" offset="5807515">The argument would go just as it does here that some portion of the interest that is received by the taxpayer from the federal bonds is really allocable to these other deductions... interest deductions, child care deductions, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.949" offset="5866447">So some of that has already been taken into account, and therefore they are only going to subtract a portion of the interest from federal bonds from the final taxable income figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.548" offset="5908870">That is a principle, a very broad application and that would have a substantial impact on the marketability of the United States securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.811" offset="5937918">I would also like just briefly to touch on this question of Atlas Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.276" offset="5963727">We think the very simple answer to that is that that case only involves an interpretation of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.278" offset="5983789">This case involves an interpretation of the statute that concededly must go beyond the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.234" offset="6011583">Now the state has tried to suggest, to quote one sentence from this Court that the statute is co-extensive with the Constitution, but that obviously can't be the case because, if that were so, Congress wasn't really doing anything when it amended the statute in 1959, and everyone agrees that in fact they substantially expanded the scope of the statute in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.418" offset="6100295">Finally, I would also like to echo something Mr. Zink said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.812" offset="6117954">Which is, that part of the purpose of Congress in amending the statute in '59 was to eliminate this kind of semantical argument about whether the tax is on federal obligations or whether it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.811" offset="6177931">It leads to a lot of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.801" offset="6185872">It leads to a lot of difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.313" offset="6191933">They set down a very bright rule that is easily applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.884" offset="6206248">If consideration of federal obligations is essential to the computation of the tax, then the tax is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.593" offset="6249089">Now it may be that in some cases that tends to invalidate taxes that do not seem necessarily unfair on their face, but that is a consequence of the tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.339" offset="6283988">That is something that is within the power of Congress to enact, and that is what they have done here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1558.640" offset="6361206">While we basically agree with the facts as presented, we would like to emphasize certain additional facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.307" offset="6391926">The Georgia bank share tax is not measured by gross assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.042" offset="6418885">Instead, those assets which were purchased with liability funds are completely removed from the measure of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.267" offset="6451694">The tax is only measured by those assets which were purchased by net worth funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.314" offset="6475936">It is simply incorrect to say that Georgia's method only removes a portion of federal obligations from the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.368" offset="6508119">Instead, Georgia's method fully removes all federal obligation values from the computation of the tax, and it does so in this manner:</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.752" offset="6545631">Georgia's method reasonably attributes a portion of federal obligation values to liabilities, and it reasonably attributes a portion of federal obligation values to net worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.983" offset="6594636">And then it removes from both accounts federal obligation values.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.574" offset="6608951">For example--</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.508" offset="6632671">That would happen if you treated the bank as owning no federal obligations at all?</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.272" offset="6659734">If the bank owned no federal obligations at all, they would be entitled to no deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.775" offset="6681781">But in this case, for example in the case of C&amp;S Bank that was used in the Georgia Supreme Court's example, there was a deduction of $200,000 of federal obligations that were attributed to the net worth account, but there was also attributed to the liability account approximately $1,700,000 of federal obligation value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.879" offset="6770179">And the total of the federal obligation values that were attributed to the liability account, and the total that were attributed to the net worth account, equal all federal obligation values.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.458" offset="6816468">And as a result, all federal obligation values were removed from the measure of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.891" offset="6838202">First Atlanta's method, on the other hand, would create a double deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.524" offset="6856801">What First Atlanta is asking this Court to do is to deduct all federal obligation values one fine from gross assets, and then to deduct those federal obligation values which were purchased with funds from liabilities a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.006" offset="6922734">And in doing so, it creates a deduction which is greatly in excess of federal obligation values that are actually represented in the adjusted tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.032" offset="6966829">We submit that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.474" offset="6984592">It should be affirmed because Georgia's method fully complies with Section 3701 by removing federal obligation values in full from the computation of the tax, and it does so without sheltering otherwise taxable assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.766" offset="7049689">Georgia's method is in accordance with the decisions of this Court, and Georgia's method effectuates the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.790" offset="7081872">Georgia's method fully complies with Section 3701.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.544" offset="7096814">Section 3701 requires that federal obligation values be excluded from the computation of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.930" offset="7134431">As I previously pointed out, Georgia's method presumes that a portion of federal obligation values are represented in net worth, and a portion are represented in liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.467" offset="7180511">I remind the Court that before reaching the measure... before reaching the tax base, that already 90 percent of assets have been removed, and Georgia is attributing a portion of those federal obligation values to those assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.926" offset="7242369">So, for example, Georgia says that if 9.75 percent of federal obligations are represented in total assets, then 9.75 are represented in net worth and in the liability account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.677" offset="7305376">And Georgia's method is one which is reasonable, and it's legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.251" offset="7323662">It is one that is recognized by both bankers and bank regulators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.444" offset="7344455">For example, the Bank Administration Institute recognizes that banks have on this side of the balance sheet liabilities and net worth, and they have a pool of funds which they can use to invest in assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.503" offset="7408716">And these pool of funds are co-mingled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.575" offset="7420942">What they do is, since they don't know which fund was used to purchase which asset, they presume that a portion of each and every fund is invested in each and every asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.646" offset="7477262">This is the formula that they use in their cost analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.657" offset="7493249">The Federal Reserve Board does the same thing in their cost analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.889" offset="7506205">Georgia has simply adopted that concept, and has attempted to accord federal obligations full tax-exempt status in a reasonable manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.538" offset="7556778">They do so, and the formula is not inflexible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.020" offset="7566705">This formula is to be used only when a bank cannot demonstrate where their federal obligation values were purchased from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.697" offset="7605471">If appellant, of any bank, can come in and demonstrate that greater federal obligation values are present in net worth, the Georgia court has said, we will make an appropriate adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.645" offset="7653222">It is the intent of Georgia to fully accord tax-exempt status to these federal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.219" offset="7679554">And we would submit that the pro-rata method is equitable to a fault; that it really allocates to net worth a greater portion of federal obligation values than area actually present in net worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.897" offset="7734202">Prudent banking practices would dictate that liability funds, those funds which include deposits, would be used... and these are very volatile sources, and have to be available for potential withdrawal demand... that those funds would more than likely be used to invest in federal obligations, because they can be quickly sold and turned over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.901" offset="7826258">On the other hand, net worth is not volatile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.184" offset="7839423">It's the most stable of all the bank's assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.335" offset="7847991">And as a result, those funds can be invested in longer yielding assets which don't require a quick turnaround for withdrawal demands, because there are none, and are generally invested in bank premises in higher yielding assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.105" offset="7907133">First Atlanta's method, on the other hand, is irrational, yet is not required by Section 3701, and it distorts the intent of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.313" offset="7947884">It is irrational because what First Atlanta is saying to this Court and asking this Court to accept is this:</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.756" offset="7969722">It is asking the Court to create an irrebuttable presumption that all federal obligation values are present in net worth, a presumption which simply has no basis in reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.294" offset="8023848">First Atlanta doesn't attempt to show that it has a basis in reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.417" offset="8040357">They just say, if we're going to remove federal obligations from the tax base and we don't know if they were purchased from liabilities and we don't know if they were purchased from net worth, in effect they're saying let's just pretend that they are present in net worth because we know if we remove it there that they'll be completely gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.039" offset="8118829">Well, we could as easily pretend that they were all present in liabilities; because we recognize that those federal obligations which were purchased with liabilities are already excluded, and are never excluded in Georgia's tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.768" offset="8177761">So it could be accomplished in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.711" offset="8185494">But instead, Georgia has tried to fairly allocate that portion of federal obligations which would be represented in the liability account, and that portion which would be represented in the net worth account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.348" offset="8236067">In effect, what First Atlanta is saying is that, as Justice Stone noted in Missouri v. Gehner, that tax exempt also means debt exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.027" offset="8278803">First Atlanta is saying that federal obligations would not be subject to any liabilities, and that simply is not the case in banking practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.453" offset="8316524">First Atlanta's method is not required by Section 3701.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.556" offset="8336899">It creates a double deduction, and it affords a tax shelter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.248" offset="8355707">It creates a double deduction because it removes from total assets all federal obligation values.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.294" offset="8391861">And then when those liability funds which were used to purchase those federal obligation values are removed, then those federal obligation values are removed a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.595" offset="8453092">And as a result, First Atlanta's method deducts federal obligation values which far exceed the amount of federal obligation values which are present in net worth, and it does so at the expense of the taxing power of the state to tax those assets which are proper subjects of state and local taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.388" offset="8536266">First Atlanta's method also distorts the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.070" offset="8554969">As this Court pointed out in American Bank and Trust Company, the purpose of the amendment in 1959 to Section 3701 was to extend the reach of the immunity to taxes which previously had not been included.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.732" offset="8617559">That is, indirect taxes such as bankshare taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.395" offset="8632292">It is not correct, as appellant argues, that Iowa... that the legislative history would indicate that federal obligations must be removed from gross assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.764" offset="8685686">Instead, the problem in Idaho... I believe it was Idaho, was that they were attempting to tax federal obligation values indirectly by saying, we are not really imposing a tax on the federal obligation values; instead, we are imposing it on income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.774" offset="8753814">And they made no attempt whatsoever to remove federal obligation values from the computation of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.858" offset="8782130">First Atlanta's method distorts the intent of Congress because this double deduction has the effect of exaggerating the immunity from taxation into a total exemption from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.836" offset="8838032">It would have the effect of wiping out bankshare taxes as a feasible revenue measure for the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.421" offset="8864364">This is so because virtually all banks in the United States possess sufficient federal obligations to wipe out their bankshare tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.889" offset="8906264">We submit that such a radical change cannot be attributed to Congress to eliminate a revenue measure which at that time was being used by a majority of the states and, at that time, banks in those states owned enough federal obligations to wipe out their bankshare tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.092" offset="8987035">That such a sharp change in existing state law cannot be attributed to Congress absent the clearest indication in the legislative history of that purpose, and there is no such indication in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.783" offset="9053804">Georgia's method is also in accordance with the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.128" offset="9075224">In United States v. Atlas Life Insurance Company, this Court in 1965 recognized that a pro rata deduction similar to one that is being used by the Georgia court did not violate the constitutional prohibition against taxation of state and municipal bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.890" offset="9162264">In Atlas Life, the Court was confronted with a similar problem that the Court is confronted with today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.835" offset="9190058">That is, how to remove tax exempt interest without, at the same time, sheltering taxable assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.311" offset="9223913">They had, like Georgia has, a tax... in that case there was a tax on investment income, but a portion of that investment income was excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.286" offset="9263828">And that portion that was attributed to the policyholder's share was excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.931" offset="9282427">Well, in the same case, Georgia excludes that portion of assets that are attributed to liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.814" offset="9305938">In Atlas Life, the portion that was attributed to the company was included in... was taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.847" offset="9334045">In that case, the insurance company argued, the only way that we're going to be able to remove tax-exempt interest is to take it all from the company share, just like First Atlanta saying to the Court today that the only way to remove tax-exempt interest is to remove it from the net worth portion of those assets attributed to net worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.293" offset="9419831">But the Court rejected that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.834" offset="9429967">They said, there is no sound reason to believe that all tax exempt interest is attributed to the company's share.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.029" offset="9466747">Instead, a portion of that tax exempt interest is also attributed to the policyholder's share.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.774" offset="9493810">And they said that a pro rata method reasonably and fairly removed tax exempt interest without sheltering assets which were proper subjects of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.943" offset="9542398">And in reaching that conclusion, the Court looked at the extensive legislative history, and they noted that it was the conclusion of Congress that a pro rata method did not impose any tax at all on exempt values.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.362" offset="9608122">The Department of the Treasury came and testified before Senate committee hearings and stated that the formula provided by the Senate bill did not place a tax on tax exempt interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.080" offset="9655038">Senator Byrd stated to the Senate committee: In providing the formula I have described to the Senate, it was the intention of the committee not to impose any tax on tax exempt interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.618" offset="9701118">Therefore, the Court concluded that a pro rata method which was similar to the method used by Georgia fully complied with the requirement that the tax exempt interest be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.297" offset="9743854">In addition, Georgia's method effectuates the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.349" offset="9764021">As I previously indicated, in 1959 when Congress amended the statute, the purpose of that amendment was to extend the immunity to forms of taxation which had not previously been included.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.606" offset="9813131">It is more reasonable to assume that Congress was familiar with and approved the pro rata method of recognizing exemptions upheld in Atlas Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.736" offset="9869660">This is because, at the time the income tax act was being considered in 1959, the amendment to Section 3701 was also being considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.235" offset="9919606">There was a three month difference in their enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.858" offset="9934130">And as a result, Congress' findings and intent respecting pro rata allocation methods are particularly appropriate to understanding what Congress expected Section 3701 to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.195" offset="9995466">First Atlanta would attribute to these same legislators a conclusion that states must be barred from employing pro rata methods, and we submit that such a stunning change in position cannot be attributed to Congress absent the clearest indication in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.830" offset="10078013">The Solicitor General has stated that Georgia's method would increase the cost of federal borrowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.515" offset="10108733">We submit, as opposed to First Atlanta's method, that Georgia's method would have the opposite result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.541" offset="10136840">That, if anything, that it would tend to decrease the cost of federal borrowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.392" offset="10156276">The Solicitor General's prediction is unsupported in the record, and it is based on a false premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.646" offset="10185219">The Solicitor General misunderstood and thought that Georgia was only excluding a portion of tax exempt values, and states that 90 percent, for example in the C&amp;S example, that 90 percent of those federal obligations remained subject to the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.269" offset="10251779">That simply is not correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2893.755" offset="11701680">In short, I think if you example that argument they've made, you'll see that Georgia's formula is not tax neutral, and it is supposed to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.701" offset="11737520">Separately, the state taxing authorities have said that federal obligations are allocated to a nontaxable liability account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.647" offset="11781301">That's an attempt... and I don't blame them... to wrap their case in Atlas Life, Congress and Atlas Life said this account is nontaxable, and that one is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.563" offset="11816932">Liabilities are not... there's no allocation to a liability account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.178" offset="11835427">What they're doing is using liabilities to offset and reduce the amount of federal obligations by liabilities that, in some cases, have absolutely nothing to do with the obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.253" offset="11875655">For example, one of the liabilities is an obligation in accrual for state tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.259" offset="11907734">Now I ask you, how can that be a proper offset to federal obligations?</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.392" offset="11928214">The state taxing authorities have said, and been concerned about a double deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.424" offset="11948380">This is not a double deduction case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.695" offset="11957471">We don't care about a double deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.588" offset="11964994">We just don't want to be taxed in contravention of the congressional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.850" offset="11982026">In my example that I gave of a contribution of federal obligations to capital, there is no sheltering effect at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.215" offset="12015567">Justice Stevens talked about the conversion of a taxable asset to a nontaxable asset, and that would be true if you've already had the asset on tax day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.483" offset="12056631">But if you earned a dollar during the year and before tax day used that dollar to buy a federal obligation under the Georgia formula, your tax goes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.989" offset="12098636">We don't think that can be read to reconcile with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.873" offset="12118176">Finally, the taxing authorities have said that if we can trace the source of funds by which we purchase federal obligations, that they might give us a deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.104" offset="12179094">First, in the operations of a bank there is money coming in and out every day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.718" offset="12201559">It's a physical impossibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.158" offset="12207306">Second, there is nothing in the statute that conditions the exemption given by Congress on that type of burden, where you would actually have to say, yes, if you use that dollar to purchase a federal obligation, we will give you the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.157" offset="12267283">Thank you.</text>
