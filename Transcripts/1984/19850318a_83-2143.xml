            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="126900">We will hear arguments first this morning in the State of Tennessee v. Harvey Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.896" offset="162427">Mr. Grunow, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert A. Grunow</label>
            <text syncTime="14.402" offset="184474">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="22.165" offset="215507">This criminal case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals which reversed Defendant Street's first degree murder conviction and sentence of life imprisonment and remanded the case for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.206" offset="275693">The question before this Court is whether a nontestifying accomplice's confession can be constitutionally used on rebuttal to impeach the defendant's claim that his own confession was a coerced imitation of the accomplice's.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.505" offset="340895">The facts relevant to this inquiry are as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="57.319" offset="356151">This prosecution arises out of the 1981 murder of a 72 year old man who was found hanged outside his burglarized home in a small mountain community in east Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.287" offset="407978">The defendant, a Clifford Peele, and five other young adults, were charged with murder, and defendant Street's case was severed from the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.024" offset="450923">The state's proof in chief at Street's trial consisted of several confessions by the defendant and testimony of law enforcement officers concerning the scene of the crime that tended to corroborate certain details of the defendant's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.595" offset="517274">From the time of its opening argument through its case in chief, the state did not mention the existence of Peele's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.900" offset="554472">Thereafter, the defendant presented an alibi defense and took the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.243" offset="575788">In his direct testimony the defendant admitted that Peele had given a confession which had implicated the defendant in the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.851" offset="610270">The defendant also admitted that he gave a confession but maintained it was merely a coerced imitation of Peele's earlier confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.627" offset="645378">With regard to this claim, the defendant maintained that prior to taking his confession, the sheriff repeatedly read him Peele's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.543" offset="681009">The defendant also claimed that when taking his confession, the sheriff interrupted him any time his account varied from Peele's and demanded that the defendant replicate Peele's version, which the defendant then did.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.021" offset="738897">As part of its rebuttal proof, the state for the first time in this case sought to introduce Peele's confession into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.106" offset="771289">Over objection, the state was allowed to introduce the confession for the limited, non-hearsay purpose of establishing that it was said, and with the express goal of impeaching the defendant's parroting claim with the most appropriate evidence available.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.707" offset="833669">Limiting instructions were given on three occasions, and the record clearly indicates that the state carefully limited its use of and argument on the accomplice's confession to the impeachment purpose for which it was introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.507" offset="892915">Thereafter, the defendant was convicted of first degree murder and was given the only sentence permitted in this case under state law, life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.731" offset="929800">On appeal, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the conviction of the defendant on the ground that the introduction of Peele's confession under the circumstances of this case denied the defendant his confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.062" offset="991135">The state urges this Court to reverse the decision below since the limited introduction of the accomplice's confession for the impeachment purposes on rebuttal did not violate the defendant's confrontation rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.902" offset="1046410">We contend that limiting instructions were adequate in this case to avoid a confrontation clause violation for four reasons which I will summarize and then address in sequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.248" offset="1087788">First, the manner of introduction of the questioned evidence created little if any likelihood of improper jury consideration of that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.055" offset="1127076">Second, there existed legitimate and compelling reasons justifying the state's use of such evidence in light of the defendant's parroting claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.930" offset="1166573">Third, no suitable alternatives existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.104" offset="1179217">And fourth, under the circumstances of this case, the evidence was not devastating in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.178" offset="1207533">In applying the confrontation clause to the admission into evidence of nontestifying accomplice confessions, Bruton, Douglas and the Parker plurality of this Court have addressed two basic questions: first, whether the manner of introduction of such evidence creates a substantial likelihood of improper consideration of that evidence against the defendant, and second, if so, whether the resulting risk of unfair prejudice as a matter of policy or practical necessity outweighs the ability of a jury to follow limiting instructions given.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.472" offset="1344729">We suggest that both questions are answered in the negative in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.884" offset="1362387">As to the first basic question, the manner of introduction created little if any likelihood of improper consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.459" offset="1396660">Unlike prior cases in this are where no legitimate inferences against the defendant could be drawn from the evidence placed before the jury, in this case there was a legitimate inference that could be drawn from the introduction of Peele's statement, namely, that Peele's confession was sufficiently different from the defendant's so as to negate the defendant's parroting claim--</text>

            <text syncTime="648.846" offset="2722218">As to the first factor, there were legitimate and compelling reasons justifying the state's use of such evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.833" offset="2754191">In Bruton and Parker, this court dealt with judicial economy in a joint trial as a justification for the use.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.348" offset="2788255">Here, the more important justification lies in the defendant's election to place before the jury his parroting claim which called into question the very terms of his accomplice's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.546" offset="2837052">Now, as a practical matter, the state was justified in using the accomplice's confession because it was the strongest and only adequate evidence to directly challenge that defendant's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.763" offset="2881878">As a policy matter, after making his parroting claim, the defendant should not be allowed to invoke the confrontation clause to bar the limited non-hearsay rebuttal use of such evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.901" offset="2930466">Such invocation of the confrontation clause would impede the ability of the jury to assess the credibility of the defendant's claim, thereby posing a grave risk of perversion of the truth-seeking function of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.748" offset="2981875">It would also permit the defendant to use the confrontation clause as a shield to subvert the very mission of that clause as ensuring the fairness and accuracy of the criminal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.818" offset="3026074">Such a policy is consistent with past decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.822" offset="3050107">In 1948 in Michelson v. United States, this Court recognized that evidence which may be too prejudicial to introduce in the state's proof in chief, even with limiting instructions, may nevertheless be used for impeachment purposes once the defendant elects to put that issue into evidence by taking the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.924" offset="3130564">Now, Michelson v. United States admittedly does not raise constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.418" offset="3152507">However, other cases cited in our brief suggest that constitutional protections, whether afforded by prophylactic exclusionary rules or by direct application of constitutional rights, should not provide a defendant with a shield to bar the legitimate impeachment techniques in assessing the credibility of a defendant's claim that he asserts on the stand.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joshua Ira Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="1184.616" offset="4865303">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.887" offset="4882440">In view of the United States, the decision of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals represents a misapplication of the doctrine of this Court's decision in Bruton v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.754" offset="4921832">Contrary to the argument of respondent, this Court's decision in Bruton does not hold that the reception in evidence for any purpose of the inculpatory statement of a nontestifying accomplice necessarily violates the confrontation clause, nor does it hold that instructions that limit the use of such a statement are in all cases ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.549" offset="5009081">Rather, as we understand it, the Court held that in light of the inadmissibility of the hearsay statement incriminating Bruton in that case, the critical weight added to the prosecution's case by the declarant statement there and the general availability of separate trials as a device to avoid the problem that existed in Bruton, there was no sufficient justification for running the risk that the limiting instruction given in Bruton would prove an insufficient bulwark against the risk of unfair prejudice that would result if the instruction were disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.851" offset="5142201">This case differs from Bruton in numerous critical respects which we believe call for a different conclusion here and require that the judgment of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.098" offset="5195282">Bruton emphasizes the inadmissibility under the traditional rules of evidence as against the Defendant Bruton of the declarant's out of court statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.954" offset="5230704">Here, of course, the declarant Peele's statement was admissible against respondent for a proper purpose, and there doesn't really seem to be any debate that the state had a legitimate objective here and it was one that we deem compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.444" offset="5280650">That purpose, of course, was to enable the jury to assess the respondent's claim that his own statement was a coerced imitation of the declarant's, and we agree with the state's argument that the very best evidence available to the jury to assess that claim was to look at the statement itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.445" offset="5352644">This is partly, Justice Stevens, because of the fact that... I think it would naturally occur to a juror that the best way is to look at the two statements side by side to see what all the nuances are, and while it may have been sufficient, I might well... we as jurors might well have been persuaded by the omissions factor, a juror in assessing this claim I think would want to see the whole thing, and I think it was an important kind of evidence.</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="1334.884" offset="5466433">But isn't the argument also available that the burden really was on the defendant to prove his parroting claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.747" offset="5493809">I mean, he's the one who brought it up, and I would suppose if there were merit to it, he would have been the one to put the confession in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1348.192" offset="5519618">Well, this case has a peculiar fact in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.415" offset="5532471">The defendant did attempt to do that and failed in doing so on the grounds that the statement was hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.650" offset="5565489">At the point in the case where that occurred, it may have been premature, but the defendant did signal his own understanding that this was the most appropriate way to prove his claim by attempting to get the statement before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.821" offset="5626093">So it probably does not lie terribly well in the respondent's mouth to say that this is an inappropriate way of demonstrating this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.576" offset="5661202">The other factor which, if I can pick up further on your colloquy with the Attorney General, if the sheriff had simply denied, as he did, that these particular facts were in Peele's statement, there would of course have been the question of whether that was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.058" offset="5739047">Now, you said, Justice Stevens--</text>

            <text syncTime="1419.320" offset="5804144">If the officer says A, B, and C are in one statement and not the other, and they are both sitting here in the courtroom and nobody submits them to the jury, that testimony is pretty persuasive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1468.390" offset="6000376">On the question which was the only question material to the state's purpose in putting the statement before the jury on rebuttal, whether the declarant had actually made the statement, the purpose and requirements of the confrontation clause were satisfied, Sheriff Papantoniou, through whose testimony the statement was put before the jury initially, was available for cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.415" offset="6084490">This Court's decision in Dutton v. Evans establishes, we believe, that there is no, in those circumstances, there is no confrontation clause problem, and we believe that that conclusion is supported not only by the opinion for the plurality of Justice Stewart, but also by Justice Harlan's concurring opinion, and therefore was endorsed by a majority of the Court in Dutton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.339" offset="6168187">Conversely, we would emphasize, the state's purpose in laying the declarant's statement before the jury could not have been served by presenting the declarant's testimony in lieu of his statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.155" offset="6211445">Because of this unique situation that the live testimony wouldn't have served the state's purpose and the statement did not go to the... was not offered for the truth of its content, it would have been very peculiar to impose upon the state as respondent would have it and as the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals had it, the burden of calling the declarant as a witness simply so that respondent could cross examine him on matters outside of the scope of the state's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.715" offset="6333698">Indeed, if one accept's the respondent's premise, one might well ask what examination the state was required to undertake of Mr. Peele.</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.365" offset="7132314">And finally, it is possible that the declarant would have taken the Fifth Amendment and would have been unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.270" offset="7151958">And if that were to have occurred, it would be a very extreme result and nonetheless hold that even if that had occurred, there would have been no opportunity for the state to use the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.558" offset="7205039">The final point that I would like to comment on if time allows concerns the bearing of this Court's decision in Parker v. Randolph on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.146" offset="7255403">The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals thought that Parker v. Randolph had no bearing because this case did not involve a joint trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1833.729" offset="7461770">The state was interested in demonstrating that the two confessions were not identical, and the defense was interested in preserving Street's confrontation rights by making sure that those portions of the confession of Clifford Peele which directly accused Street of committing the crime charged, were not read to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.283" offset="7531987">Both of these purposes could have been served in this case if the state had simply redacted the portions which directly incriminated Street or abided by the original agreement--</text>

            <text syncTime="1938.100" offset="7879207">There were several differences in this case which the state deemed critical to their position, and I would like to demonstrate how.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.724" offset="7917764">They had called Sheriff Papantoniou to the stand to read Peele's confession and then engaged in an agreement with the defense to merely highlight the differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.001" offset="7954858">That is, in response to the questions from the prosecutor, they would highlight the differences between the two confessions without reading all of Peele's confession to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.626" offset="7989339">In pursuit of this agreement, the Court instructed the sheriff to read the confession to himself, which he did, and at this point the prosecutor approached the bench and then requested permission to read the entire text into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.546" offset="8041062">The Court reminded him of the original agreement, but the prosecutor claimed it would be more coherent if he read the entire text into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.831" offset="8070214">He then read the entire text into evidence and then proceeded to do precisely what he said he could not do, and that is have Sheriff Papantonious highlight differences between the two of them in response to questioning without mentioning any of the portions of the confession which accused Joe Street of participating in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.484" offset="8156836">There were seven critical distinctions, and on closing argument, the prosecutor again went through those seven distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.541" offset="8192990">It is our position that the confrontation clause was violated once the state went beyond what was necessary to show that the two statements were not identical and that this violation was not cured either through limiting instructions or by simply labeling it non-hearsay.</text>

            <text syncTime="2243.578" offset="9101111">In Harris and Hass and that line of cases, the sword/shield cases, we engage in a balancing test, balancing the reason for the admission against the reason for the exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.695" offset="9145623">In those cases we exclude... evidence that was reliable and trustworthy was excluded and the truth was frustrated in order to deter police misconduct, in order to get them to comply with Miranda, but there was nothing wrong with the statements themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.295" offset="9208004">They were not involuntary or coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.579" offset="9217199">So the balancing test favored using the evidence to enhance the truth finding function of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.041" offset="9243008">In this case, though, Peele's statement was excluded precisely because it did constitute a threat to truth determination either under a hearsay analysis or confrontation analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.939" offset="9282609">Under Bruton, the in-custody confession of an accomplice is inevitably suspect, and I think that makes the distinction between this case and the sword/shield cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.195" offset="9395667">Well, at that point in the trial the state had given every indication that they were going to call Clifford Peele on direct examination, and so as a tactical matter, there was an interest in trying to diffuse what we thought would be his potentially incriminating, indeed, devastating testimony against Joe Street, and also to introduce it for whatever relevance it would have on the parroting point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.415" offset="9500471">At a minimum, though, our position there is no more inconsistent than that of the state because the state objected at that point to introduction of that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.328" offset="9536206">It is our position that to the jury, that the impeachment value of Clifford Peele's confession was not that the two statements were not identical, but rather, that it rebutted Joe Street's alibi defense by placing him at the scene of the crime and assigning him an active role in the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.942" offset="9610603">There was no physical evidence linking Joe Street to the crime, and there were no eye witnesses presented by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.435" offset="9632546">Peele's confession, however, provided the state with its missing eye witness testimony free of the risk of cross examination and free of the risk of the jury viewing his demeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.894" offset="9674446">We believe also that the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals properly interpreted the interlocking confession doctrine by holding that it does not apply to severed trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.393" offset="9748425">At joint trial the state has a compelling interest in introducing the confessions of the codefendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.279" offset="9776010">The state is presented with a dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.680" offset="9785519">They have two or maybe even three perfectly valid confessions which they wish to introduce against the confessers, but under a rigid Bruton application, they are prohibited from introducing those confessions against the confessers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.761" offset="9841943">Parker and the similar interlocking confession cases allows them to introduce the confessions against the confessers, but they had already accomplished that purpose in this case, and we feel that that is a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.457" offset="9892725">We also believe that this Court should decline to reverse pursuant to the doctrine of harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.455" offset="9932640">The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals concluded, after examining the record, that they could not say beyond a reasonable doubt that the confrontation violation here had no effect on the verdict or that the evidence of guilt was otherwise overwhelming.</text>
