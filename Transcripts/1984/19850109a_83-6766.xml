            <text syncTime="882.596" offset="3654511">When you get to the cross examination by the trial counsel at about page 398 of the trial record, he asked this lady,</text>

            <text syncTime="900.989" offset="3728072">Apparently, there were no efforts for her to make an in person identification of Hayes up until that moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.393" offset="3757747">Once had completed his cross examination, he made a motion to strike the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.749" offset="3791184">I don't think that helps in the determination we're talking about for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.652" offset="3818769">Number one, under Florida rules of criminal procedure, any type of motion to suppress made after the trial begins is discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.027" offset="3856281">There's no absolute requirement that the judge hear it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.146" offset="3868715">But number two, and perhaps more important, as I understand Mr. Bader's motion to strike, it was directed wholly toward credibility and not legal admissibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.352" offset="3909571">So I don't think we can infer from that that Judge Adams, who was the trial judge, ever made a specific finding that Mrs. Hollander's identification was legally valid and admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.445" offset="3969966">Getting back to the question that was left open by Davis v. Mississippi, as I noted, after Davis there were a number of states that passed statutes permitting fingerprinting and similar identification-oriented investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.329" offset="4077486">Some of them could be done at the police station, and I suppose, as Justice O'Connor has pointed out, it could be done, if you had all of your equipment and everything that was necessary, you probably could go to the person's house and do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.921" offset="4127850">Two distinctions I want to make there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.623" offset="4138612">Number one, the fact remains in this case that the defendant was moved, and what I sense from some of the frustration that I detect in trying to resolve the Royer case was the end conclusion was that it doesn't necessarily matter that they could have detained Royer undue a sort of Terry stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.954" offset="4223981">Nevertheless, they didn't do it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.156" offset="4232758">What they did to Royer was to move him, and that brings... that presents problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.076" offset="4260448">And if he's moved, he's detained for an unreasonable length of time, that it's too bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.862" offset="4279569">It could possibly have been done in a legal manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.814" offset="4291377">It wasn't done in a legal manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.332" offset="4297541">A point I wanted to make about these statutes is that regardless of the exact procedure specified, I in the brief quoted from the Colorado statute which is quite rigorous in its requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.710" offset="4367027">When you have only a reasonable suspicion, you may still get an authorization to take prints or whatever.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.915" offset="4403808">But the point that I want to hammer home is it's always done with prior judicial authorization, and that was... that never came into play in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2801.475" offset="11330018">Well, I thought the point was that three different people had versions of what he looked like, and together they were able to arrange a composite drawing that gave them their probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2810.830" offset="11367530">That leads to my last point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.364" offset="11373590">This Court said in Beck v. Ohio that a trial judge cannot make an adequate probable cause determination if they're not apprised of what the officers are going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.388" offset="11413715">Now, they said at one point in the suppression hearing that, as I understood them to say, the picture didn't look particularly like Joe Hayes, for one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.578" offset="11446524">For the second part, they didn't bring those pictures in so that the judge could look at them and decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.148" offset="11472751">And I don't see how the pictures help the State's argument when the trial judge never got to look at them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.819" offset="11499396">In other words, conceivably they may have had probable cause, but if they did... and I don't think they did... but if they did, they didn't prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.991" offset="11528131">The last point I wanted to make regarded inevitable discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.859" offset="11547566">My position would be that is a trial court determination, and I base that on Nix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.597" offset="11570554">The case first came to this Court in Brewer v. Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.917" offset="11587795">The Court reversed on the basis of the invalid confession and hinted that perhaps inevitable discovery might get the body back into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.940" offset="11627919">At that time there was a second suppression hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.725" offset="11639099">Isn't it Iowa, isn't that the state?</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.261" offset="11649235">Then... then argued inevitable discovery at the trial, and so when it came back to this Court, we had a record whereupon this Court could make a determination if the inevitable discovery rule did apply in those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.953" offset="11716003">And such is not the case with Hayes v. Florida.</text>

            <text syncTime="2901.340" offset="11729483">But if your friend is right on his theory that there was probable cause at the time they went to the man's home, then the inevitable discovery claim evaporates from the case, is that not right?</text>
