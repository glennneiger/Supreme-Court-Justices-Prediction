            <text syncTime="16.593" offset="197073">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, this is a case about invidious discrimination in enforcement of the immigration laws of the United States against black Haitian refugees who were seeking political asylum in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.845" offset="278053">For over ten years, immigration enforcement officials in south Florida have applied the law with an unequal hand and an evil eye, as this Court said in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, against Haitians seeking political asylum as is their right under the statutes and treaties of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.452" offset="376482">Although it has occurred in a variety of contexts, this case raises the issue with respect to detention and parole and discrimination in that detention and parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.190" offset="431444">In the spring of 1981, approximately 1,700 Haitians came to the United States fleeing the politically repressive conditions and the persecution of their homeland in Haiti.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.392" offset="496227">Unlike refugees such as Nicaraguan refugees, such as Cuban refugees, who entered south Florida at the same time, under the same circumstances, and indeed, unlike other excludable aliens who entered the United States at the same time, Haitians and Haitians alone were incarcerated.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.296" offset="819832">They said that it should be remanded on a facially legitimate and bona fide standard.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="178.310" offset="843865">The question of whether the neutral standards since adopted by regulation by the government were complied with and as applied kind of a compliance standard, is that what you understand?</text>

            <text syncTime="193.978" offset="906559">--Well, again, I honestly think it is unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.750" offset="917635">I think they remanded it back to determine whether or not it was discrimination with respect to the 400 people, but they paid lip service to that discrimination because they did it under a standard which in effect is a narrow standard, appropriate in other contexts such as the substantive review of a decision, as Justice Blackmun found in Kleindienst versus Mandel, of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.038" offset="1010840">But it is not clear what the ultimate outcome of that review would be, and in addition they gave no relief to the 1,700 class members who have been released and at the same time they lifted the injunction that prevented the government from reincarcerating those 1,700.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.291" offset="1091819">So those 1,700 petitioners that are still part of this class are subject to being incarcerated again, and we have no reason to believe, based on the continuing pattern and practice of discrimination, that Haitians who have suffered in south Florida based on that continuing pattern, that these Haitians will not be redetained in a discriminatory manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.818" offset="1265899">We have no reason to believe today and in fact we believe that they are enforcing their present policy in the same discriminatory manner, and unless this Court makes it clear that the Immigration Service cannot enforce a neutral statute or regulation--</text>

            <text syncTime="316.840" offset="1398079">--Well, Your Honor, I think in some circumstances that is correct, but not in this circumstance, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.475" offset="1428590">First, the remand standard offers no relief for the 1,700 petitioners, as I said.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.348" offset="1452100">Secondly, with respect to the grounds on which the Court of Appeals remanded the case, they remanded it under a facially legitimate and bona fide standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.086" offset="1499016">That standard is not sufficient to protect against race and nationality discrimination, because that standard, while appropriate in the context of such cases as Fiallo versus Bell and in Kleindienst versus Mandel, where the Court paid great deference to the decisions of Congress and the Attorney General, is inappropriate where Congress has spoken, where the President and the Attorney General have spoken, and where low-level officials have discriminated anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.345" offset="1668080">Here, on the facts of this record, where Congress required a facially neutral statute and had on under 1182(d)(5), where the President and the Attorney General both made it clear that it should be an even-handed policy, where Congress has specifically only given the authority to the President under 1182(f) and under 1185 to make distinctions under classes of aliens, on the facts of this case I think that immigration officials do not have the right to make that distinction based on nationality.</text>

            <text syncTime="432.606" offset="1861073">The first is perhaps the abstract one, can Congress pass a statute that discriminates in the administration of the immigration laws on the basis of national origin, but I thought from your answer perhaps it is the second one raised here, where Congress and the President have taken the position that there will not be discrimination on the basis of national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.420" offset="1936306">Then you don't get to the constitutional issue because the low-level people are bound either by the administrative regulations or by the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.023" offset="2018748">The standard here is facially legitimate and bona fide.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.476" offset="2032541">Moreover, when the en banc court of the Elevent Circuit has made it clear that the United States Constitution is irrelevant, they said no constitutional review is irrelevant to race and nationality discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.315" offset="2091891">I think that the moral force of stating that the Constitution applies in this circumstance is important.</text>

            <text syncTime="503.174" offset="2143404">That's correct, Your Honor, but there is a very live controversy here, with the 1,700 people who have been released and for whom the injunction has now been lifted by the en banc court's decision, who are subjected to being redetained, and in Footnote 10 of the government's brief, they indicate that they may very well redetain them.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.336" offset="2223966">And this Court has also recognized that the mere cessation of illegal conduct, which we believe, by the way, has not occurred here... we believe the government is continuing to discriminate, as they have for ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.945" offset="2274435">But the mere cessation of that conduct, they are getting up here today and saying, we will not redetain these people based on national origin, based on the history of the Service's discriminatory actions, is not enough to moot this case out.</text>

            <text syncTime="890.439" offset="3692466">The record in this case indicates an overwhelming pattern of race and nationality discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.337" offset="3748054">That race and nationality discrimination has been wholly unregarded by the government on the record of this case except for mere protestations of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.746" offset="3805628">The statistical evidence demonstrated a stark pattern of race and national origin discrimination wholly unrebutted by the government, but statistics alone were not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.158" offset="3875323">Petitioners presented documentary evidence, testimonial evidence, all of it going to the question of both race and national origin, and all of it unrebutted by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.616" offset="3925164">The government's arguments in this case are largely arguments that are not in response to the issues presented on the facts of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.502" offset="3968632">The government suggests that finding the Constitution applicable will affect the sovereign power to control our borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.648" offset="4005308">We are not seeking from this Court any determination about any substantive review of any individual parole decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.944" offset="4042402">What we are seeking merely is the equal enforcement of the statutes as Congress and the President have promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.993" offset="4098618">If tomorrow the Congress were to pass a statute that said no one shall be paroled, that is not the case before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.599" offset="4133099">However, here, beginning in 1954, Congress passed a statute that said you made parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.907" offset="4166327">That statute, from 1954 to 1981, was enforced in a way that allowed people to be paroled if they were not likely to abscond or were not a security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.254" offset="4219721">In 1981, when the policy changed after 27 years, that policy was applied in a discriminatory manner to Haitians and Haitians alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.153" offset="4271235">The government contends here that both the Congress and the President have broad powers under the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.958" offset="4306552">We are not contesting that here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.580" offset="4317001">This is a situation where Congress, the President, and indeed even the Attorney General made it clear that the statute, 1182(d)(5), should be enforced in a facially neutral way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.899" offset="4366216">The government has argued that due process does not augment the statutory rights to admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.664" offset="4401324">This is not an admissions case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.406" offset="4412296">This is a case, as Congress has made it perfectly clear in 1182(d)(5) that separates out something we call parole from admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.451" offset="4452524">Parole is a temporary release until a final determination is made about admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.977" offset="4474572">The government contends that nationality discrimination can be drawn in the formulation of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.591" offset="4505083">This is not a question about policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.363" offset="4516159">This is a question about enforcement, and even the language that the government quotes from Galvan versus Press when Justice Frankfurter said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.448" offset="4544475">"We are not writing on a clean slate but 100 years of history. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.360" offset="4564120">even there Justice Frankfurter made it perfectly clear that when it comes to the enforcement of the immigration statutes, due process applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.727" offset="4601527">The United States Congress in 1965 made it perfectly clear that they would abolish all nationality istinctions in the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.214" offset="4647502">In 1980, they reaffirmed that principle with respect to refugees, and in 1967 we agreed and became signatories to the United Nations Convention and Protocol with respect to the status of refugees which in Article 3 has a non-discrimination provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.676" offset="4721377">The government contends here that judicial review under the Constitution will somehow affect its powers, but this Court, Justice Powell in Fiallo versus Bell made it very clear in Footnote 5 that even in the question of Congress's power to act on matters of admission, even on those questions, it will be subjected to a constitutional standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.255" offset="4835689">Finally, the government contends that Shaughnessy versus Mezei controls this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.660" offset="4865259">In Shaughnessy versus Mezei, the question of admission was really the question at issue in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.625" offset="4897129">To release Mezei was the equivalent of granting him the admission that the Attorney General had already determined that he could not get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.611" offset="4937148">In Mezei the Attorney General had made a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.304" offset="4951881">He had decided in that case that the alien was excludable on national security grounds and on the facts of that case to allow him them to assert a procedural due process right to be released would have the effect of reversing the determination that he was an excludable alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.204" offset="5023457">Shaughnessy versus Mezei was also determined before this Court made its determination in Bolling versus Sharpe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.969" offset="5054595">It was determined before the Fifth Amendment was found to be a source of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.805" offset="5077896">Equal protection was never raised in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.898" offset="5090226">Finally, I note, as Justice O'Connor implicitly, I think, noted in Landon versus Plasencia, that the scope of Mezei is in some doubt, and I think it is in some doubt because in reality on the facts of Mezei, Mezei was really a returning resident to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.170" offset="5175385">He had lived in the United States for many years, and he was returning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.164" offset="5191372">This Court in Landon versus Plasencia said that even though an alien will be treated as an excludable alien who is a returning resident, he is still entitled to due process protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.072" offset="5238915">We submit to the Court that the issue at stake here is the same issue of equal protection and equal justice under law that this Court has recognized in a variety of contexts, and particularly in Truax v. Corrigan, where this Court said that the whole system of our law is based on the fundamental and general principle of the equal applicability of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.262" offset="5367751">That is what this case is about.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.871" offset="5418115">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I assume that it goes without saying that there is no warrant to vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.582" offset="5481018">It is very clear from the record in this case that simply governmental discrimination was urged both before the panel and also before the en banc court, and it was only the shift that was made really before this Court and that came out during the oral argument before the Eleventh Circuit that Mr. Kurzban is now emphasizing the difference between the statutory remedy and the constitutional remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.070" offset="5590941">In any event, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has clearly stated the law with respect to the authority of the Attorney General and the Congress to parole pending the determination whether to admit or to exclude, and the petitioners should not by their own change of position be permitted to achieve a vacation of that correct determination of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.789" offset="5697834">Let me say that we strongly disagree with the assertions that the government has not contested the allegations of national origin and racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.757" offset="5741720">It did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.495" offset="5744645">There was a six-week trial on that issue, and the District Court made a finding that there was no discrimination, but the real point for present purposes is that those allegations of national origin distinctions are irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.599" offset="5821027">The reason is, and the whole case comes down to the fact that the same rules that this Court has pronounced over a period of more than a century applicable to the decision whether to admit or to exclude are also both from considerations of the practical necessities of the parole decision and also by the square holding of this Court in Mezei, which has not been overruled, required to be judged by the same standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.231" offset="5951640">What I propose to do is to develop first those rules that pertain to the entry decision, whether the alien is to be admitted or excluded, and then to develop our argument that the same rules apply to parole.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.381" offset="6016214">Well, Mr. Lee, the District Court made its fact findings of no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.494" offset="6036694">The panel of the appellate court set that aside, and disagreed with those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.169" offset="6067310">Now, shouldn't the Court of Appeals en banc have determined the fact issue or at least remanded it if it thought additional facts should have been found rather than reaching the constitutional issue?</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.510" offset="8624698">As I read this Court's decisions, Justice O'Connor, the answer to that question is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.494" offset="8648626">What Landon versus Plasencia said, and what I think the cases hold, is that the exclusion of their constitutional rights relates to the decision whether to admit or not to admit, and of course the question here is, does that also extend to parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.604" offset="8709125">Prior to 1954, parole was rarely granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.169" offset="8727306">Ellis Island functioned principally as a holding point pending admission or exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.400" offset="8744234">But in 1954, we tried a new approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.663" offset="8757295">The facility Ellis Island was closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.475" offset="8768580">Parole was freely granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.566" offset="8776939">And for more than two decades no serious problems resulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.497" offset="8788642">By the late 1970's, however aliens had begun to arrive in South Florida in such unprecedented and unmanageable numbers, including some 125,000 Cubans who arrived in the port of Mariel in the spring of 1980, that it was apparent to our national leaders that something had to be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="2193.338" offset="8903999">--Well, the report was, but the appointment of the Commission, the appointment of the Commission occurred in 1980, and the report was issued in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.532" offset="8944750">That report concluded two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.668" offset="8973380">One was that there was an immigration crisis that existed in the country, and the second was that there were two reasons for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.745" offset="9017684">One, the arrival of increasing numbers of aliens lacking required entry visas, and the post-1954 policy of routine paroles prior to admissions hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.374" offset="9060211">The succeeding Administration continued the attempts to deal with this crisis, and a key element of the policy that it adopted, a policy which was recommended by the President's cabinet level task force, approved by the President and announced by the Attorney General, called for more restrictive use of parole, and increased use of detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.039" offset="9154774">In every meaningful respect, parole and entry are parts of the same whole, namely, the power of this nation to decide who will be permitted entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.955" offset="9198451">There are good reasons for mainly this or any other nation to exclude some people, national security reasons, health and safety reasons, disease control, citizen employment, and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.524" offset="9248815">Those same reasons also apply to parole, because what is at issue in both contexts is exactly the same, whether aliens will be admitted into our national community without first making the necessary showing that they are entitled to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.805" offset="9317883">The differences between parole and admission are differences of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.727" offset="9337527">Parole may be for a short time and it may be for a long time, but during the interim, the same risks are at work that lead government to exclude until eligibility is established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.617" offset="9389145">So long as the inflow is modest, those risks may be bearable, but when that reaches the crisis point, and when two successive administrations conclude that one of the reasons for the crisis is too loose standards being applied at the parole stage, then surely the Constitution does not prohibit the Congress and the Attorney General from preventing entry to those who have not proven their entitlement to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.284" offset="9495829">This is not to say that the government's constitutional power over parole depends on the existence of a crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.610" offset="9517145">It is simply that our experience of recent years shows the wisdom of this Court's holding in Mezei that parole is a part of the admission exclusion holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.414" offset="9556329">The reason that Shaughnessy versus United States ex. rel. Mezei controls this case, and the reason that all of the petitioners' attempts to distinguish it are irrelevant are tied to the holding of that case that the decision whether to parole or not to parole is a part of the exclusion-admission total package, and therefore governed by the same judicial standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.083" offset="9666983">I submit that Mezei also shows the firmness and the universality of that rule, because if there were ever to be an exception, a case whose peculiar facts would have justified treating the parole decision as something separate from the admission decision, would surely have been Mr. Mezei's case, because unlike the petitioners here, there was literally no other place in the world where he could go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.230" offset="9779623">The petitioners stress the similarities between the parolee and the excludable alien, and the differences between the parole and the alien subject to deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.512" offset="9836675">They also rely on the holding in Leng May Ma v. Barber that a paroled alien did not lose her excludable status, and we agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.347" offset="9872097">Parole is like exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.400" offset="9884322">Our point is that it ought to be treated like exclusion, as it is under Mezei.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.833" offset="9905951">The petitioners' point, of course, is that since the parole is still excludable once paroled, the government does not give up a lot by extending parole, but that argument is multiply flawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.103" offset="9967078">First, the judgments concerning just how much the government gives up are judgments to be made by Congress and by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.998" offset="10006680">Second, this Court in Mezei squarely resolved the issue against the petitioners, and that holding is dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.984" offset="10034578">And finally, the petitioners are simply wrong as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.667" offset="10049311">There are good reasons not to parole pending admission, and the petitioners' position is at odds with the findings and conclusions of two Presidential commissions in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.693" offset="10093406">The petitioners' efforts to distinguish Mezei are discussed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.308" offset="10119946">It was not called into question at all by Plasencia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.089" offset="10134993">In Plasencia, there was no issue of either exclusion or parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.154" offset="10155264">Rather, the holding was simply that it was an exclusion hearing to which Ms. Plasencia was entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.119" offset="10187133">I would like to discuss just one of the petitioners' bases for alleged distinction of the Mezei case, and that is that in Mr. Kurzban's words, this is a case about illegal discrimination, that this case is different because there is an allegation of national origin discrimination which in other contexts bring into play heightened judicial scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.503" offset="10288698">The problem with that argument is that it comes about 13 years and three rounds too late, because that same argument that reliance by the excluded alien on constitutional positions which in other contexts entitle their beneficiaries to heightened scrutiny was attempted 13 years ago in Mandel, five years later in Fiallo, and rejected both times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.146" offset="10415235">In Mandel it was First Amendment interests which were at stake, and in Fiallo classifications based on legitimacy, both of which are entitled to heightened scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.343" offset="10460061">Indeed, if anything, those were stronger cases against the government, because in both of those the argument in favor of the excluded alien also rested in substantial part, as Justice Marshall pointed out in his separate opinion in Fiallo, on the rights of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.333" offset="10524009">In Mandel, it was the acknowledged right of American citizens to receive, to hear Professor Mandel's thoughts and words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.218" offset="10563506">And in Fiallo, it was the rights of American citizens who were the kinfolk of the excluded aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.074" offset="10590986">Nevertheless, the argument was rejected both times, and in Fiallo the Court was quite explicit as to the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.899" offset="10630275">The Court reasoned as follows, quoting from Justice Frankfurter's separate opinion in Harisiades:</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.945" offset="10658487">"The conditions of entry for every alien, the particular classes of aliens that shall be denied entry altogether. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.811" offset="10693909">and then several others,</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.263" offset="10699760">"have been recognized as matters solely for the responsibility of the Congress and wholly outside the power of this Court to control. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.928" offset="10734346">Those judgments described by Fiallo, the conditions of entry for every alien, and the particular classes of aliens that shall be denied entry altogether are the precise issues, the precise judgments at issue in Mandel, again in Fiallo, and again in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2810.352" offset="11372048">And with regard to those matters, exclusion and parole are part of the same package, both legally and also as a matter of practical operational fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.699" offset="11417501">Finally, the issue in this case really comes down to Congress's constitutional authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.927" offset="11458356">What Congress has done is to establish a constitutional rule that... or, excuse me, is to establish a statutory command that aliens are to be excluded, period, and then it gives to the Attorney General the discretion to determine in his discretion whether in certain instances parole or temporary admission should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.342" offset="11560025">Accordingly, the issue is not whether the petitioners are right or we are right concerning the likely risk of admitting aliens prior to the time that their entry decision is made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2933.705" offset="11865449">His brief says that parole is not a legal admission into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.739" offset="11889586">Indeed, that is exactly what Congress has said under 1182(d)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.333" offset="11907976">They are separate, and they are separate for very good reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.878" offset="11926157">A temporary release of somebody from parole as it was established between 1954 and 1981 was for a series of reasons mostly beneficial to the government in terms of cost, but also, as this Court said in Leng May Ma, showing the enlightenment of our society in temporarily paroling people pending a determination of their admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.602" offset="12025109">Parole does not grant an admission, and indeed it is really under the government's control, sole control as to how fast they bring an alien to a hearing after he has been paroled.</text>

            <text syncTime="3147.865" offset="12722160">To the 400 petitioners who are presently in detention, it provides an impermissibly narrow standard in the context of race and nationality discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3179.044" offset="12846817">We seek injunctive relief and we seek declaratory relief because this case arises not in a vacuum, Your Honor, but under a situation of a continuing pattern and practice of discrimination.</text>
