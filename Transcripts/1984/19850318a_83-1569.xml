            <label>Mr. Wayne Alan Cross</label>
            <text syncTime="78.413" offset="451008">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="82.005" offset="465427">This case presents an issue involving the tension between the unequivocal policy of the Federal Arbitration Act, that all private agreements to arbitrate shall be enforced except in those circumstances where countervailing federal policy found in another statute would create such an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.569" offset="555707">The tension is between that policy and the judge-made policy initiated in the Second Circuit and followed by four other circuits which holds that antitrust claims may not be subject to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.749" offset="608370">In Dean-Witter v. Byrd which was decided by this Court two weeks ago, the Court expressed the purpose of the Federal Arbitration Act in precisely the terms that I think are presented today.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.227" offset="654241">It said</text>
            <text syncTime="130.496" offset="659361">"The preeminent concern of Congress in passing the act was to enforce private agreements into which parties had entered, and that concern requires that we rigorously enforce agreements to arbitrate, even if the result is piecemeal litigation, at least absent a countervailing policy manifested in another federal statute. "</text>
            <text syncTime="150.270" offset="738459">Mitsubishi in this case submits that the only issue before the Court is whether a party's contractual right to arbitrate antitrust disputes can be frustrated absent such a countervailing federal policy found in a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.301" offset="798541">The issue, despite the plethora of briefs and issues raised in those briefs, the issue is not what standard should a court apply on the enforcement of an arbitral award, nor is the issue the extent to which an arbitral award on an antitrust claim would have preclusive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.069" offset="869698">Nor is the issue whether or not antitrust cases are subject to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.153" offset="894045">Now, the parties and the courts agreed that under certain circumstances antitrust cases can in fact be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.428" offset="919122">Finally, this Court is not today, we believe, properly presented with questions of arbitrability of the Puerto Rican State Franchise Act or the Dealers' Day in Court Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.147" offset="970009">I say that because in the current state of this record, those two claims have been submitted to the Japanese Commercial Arbitration Association by the Respondent, not withdrawn, and I believe probably a decision with respect to their arbitrability on this record is moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.467" offset="1039285">Thus, I think the only issue that you have to address today is whether or not Mitsubishis right to arbitrate the Respondent's counterclaim against it brought under the Sherman Act can be frustrated by what has been denominated the American Safety Doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.448" offset="1951168">Respondent Soler Chrysler-Plymouth was a Chrysler distributor in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.642" offset="1975932">Because for historical reasons Chrysler has had distribution rights to Mitsubishi vehicles, it was necessary in entering... for Chrysler, in entering into its relationship with Soler, to have an arrangement whereby Mitsubishi and Soler could facilitate orders and deliveries of vehicles coming directly from Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.612" offset="2051792">Accordingly, Chrysler, or in fact, a subsidiary of Chrysler, Chrysler International, Mitsubishi and Soler entered into what was called a sales procedure agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.410" offset="2099021">That sales procedure agreement has an arbitration clause providing for arbitration of certain disputes including, according to the circuit court, those disputes now presented in Japan for the Japanese Commercial Arbitration Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.962" offset="2153251">In 1981 Soler's business practices in effect destroyed its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.184" offset="2182090">Soler became... was placed in a position where it could not purchase cars from Mitsubishi.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.469" offset="2203302">A series of negotiations ensued during which Mitsubishi offered to provide various forms of alternative financing to assist in obtaining financing, basically to facilitate a continuation of the relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.217" offset="2250218">Soler refused to accept any of the alternatives proposed by Mitsubishi.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.399" offset="2274982">At the same time, Soler failed to obtain financing itself to purchase cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.333" offset="2290760">In the meantime, without financing, it ordered from Mitsubishi nearly 1000 cars which were manufactured to specifications for Puerto Rico that rendered them essentially useless anywhere else in the world, and finally--</text>

            <text syncTime="580.571" offset="2459615">At the end of this, Soler terminated its relationship with Mitsubishi, and it is undisputed in this record that Soler said I don't want to have anything else to do with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.866" offset="2500889">MMC, then being owed approximately $3 million, requested arbitration pursuant to the arbitration agreement, and moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act and the convention, in the district court in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.168" offset="2566090">Soler responded somewhat predictably by filing nine counterclaims against Mitsubishi, including a federal antitrust claim, state antitrust claim, a Dealer Day in Court Act claim, and a Puerto Rican Franchise Act claim, so-called Act 75.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.658" offset="2623978">Soler also resisted arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.178" offset="2634113">The district court ordered arbitration, and Soler took an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.922" offset="2649055">The Court of Appeals denied a petition for stay pending appeal, whereupon Soler submitted all of its counterclaims to arbitration, paid the arbitration fee, and the arbitration proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.849" offset="2696807">As the arbitration proceeded on all claims, including the antitrust claims, the appeal proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.624" offset="2735886">The first circuit decided that all of the claims submitted by Soler to arbitration should indeed proceed in the arbitration, but for the federal antitrust claim, whereupon Soler withdrew the federal antitrust claim, and the case was remanded to the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.728" offset="2804327">I think that sequence is significant because what Soler did not do is withdraw either the Act 75 claim or the Dealer's Day in Court Act claim at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.183" offset="2846123">The circuit court, in reversing, found... rested solely upon the American Safety doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.811" offset="2888650">The circuit court, as I indicated before, found that the arbitration agreement was broad enough to encompass these antitrust disputes, affirmed the referenced arbitration of all other counterclaims and Mitsubishi's claims, and held that but for the American Safety doctrine, the doctrine that says that as a matter of public policy, antitrust cases are too important to be submitted to arbitral panels, it would have affirmed it with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.447" offset="2991155">We submit that the circuit court's reliance upon the American Safety case is fundamentally at odds with the purpose of the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.827" offset="3048729">As this Court has repeatedly stated, and within the last three terms in Moses Cone, Southland, Dean-Witter and a few other cases, there is a strong, unequivocal policy in... federal policy in favor of arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.547" offset="3111527">That policy, as the Court said in Dean-Witter, leaves no place for the exercise of discretion by the district court but instead mandates that district courts shall direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on issues as to which there is an arbitration agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="824.880" offset="3436908">It seized on that language and took the American Safety case and said that represents a policy of the United States which makes it not capable for resolution by arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1632.313" offset="6666583">The final comment that I would make at this point is that leaving aside the... leaving aside the American Safety doctrine, the Federal Arbitration Act and the convention, I believe this Court must reverse the lower court solely based on Scherk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.985" offset="6733352">Read most charitably, the circuit court's decision with respect to our Scherk argument is that the securities laws simply aren't as important as the antitrust laws, that this Court was prepared to limit its own holding in Wilko in the international context but should not be willing to limit the second Circuit's holding in American Safety to the domestic context because the securities laws at stake in Wilko were somehow not as important as the antitrust laws at stake here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.367" offset="6870861">We submit that the language of the United States v. Naftalin conclusively rebuts that argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1808.039" offset="7369486">For instance, this is a contract that is executed back in October 31, 1979, for the distribution of automobiles, and immediately after execution the grantor or manufacturer imposes so-called minimum sales volume for the year 1982 in the order of 1900 vehicles, more or less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.486" offset="7467289">Soler surpasses that quota extensively during that year.</text>

            <text syncTime="1849.827" offset="7536670">Over 4000, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.766" offset="7540432">For the following year, Mitsubishi, induced by the idea that Soler was selling a lot of automobiles in Puerto Rico and creating a substantial market, increased that quota to 4,750 automobiles, 236 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.578" offset="7611694">Despite that, Soler tried to comply with the quota and ordered, in its enthusiasm to sell more car, ordered more cars possibly than it should have ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.435" offset="7647116">By the year 1981 it so happened that the market in Puerto Rico was extremely soft for this type of vehicle, and then Soler had to do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.629" offset="7683896">Soler could not pay for the cars just on the basis of relying on sales in Puerto Rico because the market was very, very bad for sales of automobiles in Puerto Rico during that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.597" offset="7731752">Soler tried to convince Mitsubishi repeatedly, and in this end, enlisted the aid of the different other two dealers in Puerto Rico in order that Mitsubishi would permit transshipment to the United States or to South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.350" offset="7798730">The theory of Soler was that the other importers of Japanese vehicles, to wit, Toyota, Nissan, etcetera, were authorized to divert to the continental United States and in fact did divert, and it so appeared in the record, substantial amounts of cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.371" offset="7874903">Originally Mitsubishi took the position that they could not agree because this was, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.017" offset="7905414">"an issue with a tint of political complications. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.708" offset="7916177">July 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.269" offset="7922446">Again Soler tried to convince Mitsubishi, and this time it was not Mitsubishi but Chrysler Motor Corporation, Chrysler Corporation, that answered in a telex that they could not agree because they had agreed with Mitsubishi to divide markets, to allocate markets and so certain dealers order on the basis of so-called negotiated volumes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.505" offset="8011367">Soler kept insisting with Mitsubishi and with Chrysler, eventually received an order from Mitsubishi sometime in September 1981 to the effect that every effort concerning the possibility of transshipment had to be stopped by Soler, and reiterated that there were agreements between Chrysler, Chrysler International also, and between Mitsubishi, that prevented this type of transshipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.683" offset="8128082">By then and not by its counterclaim in the federal court, by then, February 1982, Soler for the first time, for the first time indicated in writing to Mitsubishi that this was in restraint of trade and it was against the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.856" offset="8200807">That happened, for our justices, that happened a few months before the filing of the action by Mitsubishi before the federal district court in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.134" offset="8249917">Mitsubishi filed to compel arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.456" offset="8267158">Soler answered and counterclaimed on various grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.641" offset="8287952">The district court in Puerto Rico heard argument on both sides and decided that all the claims involved in this proceeding were arbitrable and had to be arbitrated before the arbitration panel in Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.747" offset="8336330">On this occasion, Soler took an appeal to the United States District Court for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.882" offset="8360885">In that occasion, as also as it did in the lower court, Soler insisted, among other particulars, that the clause involved in this proceeding was narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.249" offset="8410414">In fact, the Court of Appeals addresses that issue specifically because of the fact that it was addressed on appeal, and it said, and I quote, its opinion, Soler answers that it never specifically agreed to arbitrate controversies that arose under such statutes as the Sherman Act, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.353" offset="8478750">So I believe that it should be very clear that from the outset, we did argue that this was a narrow clause, that it did not encompass the different claims that we are talking about today, and that it was limited to certain controversies that appeared from the clause itself, to wit, controversies under paragraph 1 to 5, 1(b) to 5, which has controversies that have nothing to do with statutory claims to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2129.462" offset="8655233">But I believe when they decided that issue against us, they were wrong, and I will tell the court why, most respectfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.466" offset="8683236">We are aware of the policy of this honorable Court in favor of arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.461" offset="8711240">In fact, arbitration is an method that is supposed to be simple, inexpensive for the revolution of different controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.006" offset="8745408">Likewise, we do realize, do realize that arbitration is a method that promotes judicial efficiencies, particularly in these days when judicial resources are so scarce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.026" offset="8797444">However, however, even though we believe that that's a salutory policy, we believe that it should not go beyond the policy itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.041" offset="8837568">In other words, the mere fact that arbitration agreements are to be construed liberally does not necessarily mean that they should be construed in such a way as to encompass particulars and conditions and terms that the parties did not agree to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.441" offset="8899112">In particularly this case, this is very important because the arbitration, it so happened, is suppose to take place about 9000 miles from Puerto Rico in Japanese... and I don't have any problem with the language except for the cost that it entails for our time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.092" offset="8961702">It entails going to Japan himself with his American attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.447" offset="8979152">It entails having translators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.497" offset="8987406">It entails transporting from Puerto Rico not only documentary evidence, but accountants, witnesses, extra witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.212" offset="9026276">It means that Mr. Soler will have to engage in all this costly litigation in Japan, and by the way, let me point to the court that at this stage Soler Chrysler-Plymouth is a Chapter 11 debtor before the Bankruptcy Court of Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.182" offset="9086149">But going back to the closest panel or not, this Court has stated that arbitration is a matter of contract, and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration in a dispute which it has not agreed so to submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.864" offset="9152814">These facts have been reiterated also by lower courts, circuit and district.</text>

            <text syncTime="2325.912" offset="9440996">In other words, this honorable Court distinguished two types of claims there, and in fact, the defendant there did not move for arbitration concerning the securities action because that was... Wilko was applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2727.360" offset="11046796">The only difference I see with Alberto-Culver in this case is that in that case you had a truly international agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.426" offset="11075112">In this case you may say that this contract looks like an international agreement, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.009" offset="11097369">However, this honorable Court explained what did it mean in characterizing as international the contract involved in the case of Scherk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.686" offset="11132164">For instance, the Court said you need two nationals, one from... a foreign national and an American national.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.939" offset="11161107">That is met in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.722" offset="11168317">You need to have negotiations outside of the continental area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.072" offset="11185663">There were no negotiations in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.464" offset="11191201">And most significantly, and I want to stress the words "most significantly" because they were recognized by the court, the court said the performance of the contract is to be carried out in a European country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.512" offset="11239475">In this case, the performance of the contract, which is most significantly stressed by the court, is to be carried out in American soil, Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.908" offset="11273016">So I say that Scherk, Scherk, as such, I cannot accept as applicable to this set of facts, just like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.442" offset="11303109">This could be an international agreement, but a truly international agreement within the context of Scherk, I would respectfully submit, is not the case of Soler with Mitsubishi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.380" offset="11346890">Finally, I believe the Solicitor General will address in more detail the issue of the nonapplicability of antitrust claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.269" offset="11402479">The case of Southland, which has not been mentioned, I believe is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.634" offset="11435916">In Southland you only had a claim under the Franchise Act of California, a local act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.407" offset="11459008">In this case you have a claim under the Antitrust Act, you have a claim under the Automobile Dealer's Act which entitles a claimant, an automobile dealer, to his day in court, day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.015" offset="11505401">I wonder whether all these rights can be waived through a stipulation for arbitration someplace in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.050" offset="11533614">The consequence of a contrary holding by this honorable Court, I respectfully submit, are ominous, ominous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.826" offset="11560676">All grantors of principal, foreign or even Americans, since they have subsidiaries some places in the Caribbean or in Europe or some other place, can impose processes of this sort and oblige people that are protected by statute that it can name strong policies to protect the small ones against the big ones, all these people will have to go to arbitrate outside of the continental United States, in foreign arbitration areas different from the United States, possibly under different languages, under different juridical criteria for the adjudication of controversies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2921.086" offset="11821692">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.389" offset="11830887">We believe that the Court of Appeals properly accommodated the three interests that are at issue in this case, and those interests are, one, the primacy of antitrust law in preserving our economic system of free competition; two, the general encouragement of arbitration as a means of resolving private disputes; and three, our commitment to an international convention that requires enforcement of agreements to arbitrate with very limited exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.428" offset="11947080">The convention contemplates that each nation may withhold from arbitration certain limited matters of special national interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.744" offset="11988353">It is a safety valve in the convention, and for the United States, that exception covers antitrust--</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.229" offset="12018342">Now, it is central to our argument that the antitrust laws in the United States are of signal importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.004" offset="12049375">They are designed to preserve competition, not just to protect competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.339" offset="12074766">They ensure the proper operation of the free enterprise system, and because of this systemic structural design, antitrust claims, even private antitrust claims, always touch on the strong public interest in competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.302" offset="12150626">And it is this factor that sets antitrust actions apart from other commercial disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.165" offset="12174032">I would like to refer to a statement by this Court in 1930 in the Paramount Famous Lasky case in which the Court said that not only the prohibitions of the Sherman Act but the remedies which it provided are coextensive with the broad conceptions of public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.496" offset="12247383">Now, among the remedies that Congress provided in order to protect the public interest is the treble damage action in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.663" offset="12279984">These private actions have been a vital part of Sherman Act enforcement for 95 years, and it is our position that parties cannot agree in advance to cast aside that statutory remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3198.858" offset="12932836">There is... one answer to that is that it is always possible that the arbitrators, rather than applying the antitrust laws too leniently, will apply it too harshly and will penalize conduct that is in fact procompetitive.</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.867" offset="13164804">But in any event, the design of the public and private attorney general enforcement of the antitrust laws was put in place with the expectation and the encouragement of the private actions as a necessary supplement to private... to governmental enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.120" offset="13245888">It was not intended that actions by the Department of Justice be the sole mechanism for enforcing the antitrust laws, and that has not been the case back to 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.994" offset="13285385">There is also the possibility in these arbitration clauses that a manufacturer could put arbitration clauses in its contracts with all of its distributors and in a fairly effective way immunize itself from the American antitrust laws because it would now have arbitration clauses with all of its direct purchasers, so they couldn't bring an antitrust action in federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3364.717" offset="13596242">As we develop in the brief, the history of the antitrust laws and the history of the enforcement of the antitrust laws strongly indicates that it was not even considered a remote possibility worth discussing that antitrust actions would be subject to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.269" offset="13674505">There is no suggestion at any point prior to the American Safety Equipment case or subsequent to it of any indication that an American antitrust action had been arbitrated by anyone anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.499" offset="13735423">And certainly, given the antiarbitration climate that existed in 1890, we can certainly suggest that Congress had no intention of supplanting the enforcement scheme that it put in place with an arbitration system that would not be subject to review on a substantive legal basis by any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.856" offset="13840853">We think it is contrary to what Congress intended in 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.949" offset="13857153">In 1890, Congress was combating companies that were using contracts to restrain trade, and appointed private attorneys general, gave them the weapon of the treble damage action to preserve the public interest and to protect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.022" offset="13937506">We think it would be directly contrary to that purpose for this court now to disarm those private attorneys general and say that companies could as a matter of contract disarm the private treble damage action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.173" offset="14006051">We have problems with submitting these cases to arbitration also in terms of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.268" offset="14034472">As it has been mentioned in this case, it is by no means clear that Swiss law interpreting a contract which is deemed by the choice of law provision in the contract to have been entirely performed in Switzerland, would say that American antitrust law is applicable to a contract entirely performed in Switzerland--</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.642" offset="14119945">There is a further shortcoming with respect to the particular arbitration rules at issue here, and that is that we note that under the rules of the Japanese Commercial Arbitration Association, the testimony that is taken is not taken under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.065" offset="14205627">That, too, is an important right that a party would have that ought to be preserved in his pursuing his treble damage action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3529.173" offset="14254110">Would you comment at some point on that last point, the absence of the oath taking?</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.898" offset="14280964">Your Honor, I can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.160" offset="14294025">I know that's in the rules, but other than... evidence is submitted both in writing and orally before the panel, but it may be that the oath taking process has something to do with the culture of Japan where taking an oath doesn't have quite the significance that it does here in the sense that--</text>

            <text syncTime="3554.001" offset="14353375">Well, then, the arbitrators have got to pass on the credibility of the people.</text>

            <text syncTime="3558.512" offset="14371452">--I think the arbitrators do, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.934" offset="14377094">I think the point that the Solicitor General makes primarily is... I think is a straw man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.221" offset="14406247">It is setting up the proposition that the antitrust laws will not be enforced in an arbitration context, and that simply flies in the fact of the arbitral process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.834" offset="14444699">But what an arbitration agreement does do to an antitrust claim is require that it be adjudicated in a different forum according to different procedures freely agreed to by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.913" offset="14489003">I believe that's what the Federal Arbitration Act and the convention contemplates.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="3593.217" offset="14510214">May I ask you on the procedure, what about discovery in an arbitration?</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.838" offset="14520768">Discovery is a big part of antitrust litigation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wayne Alan Cross</label>
            <text syncTime="3599.281" offset="14534456">--The discovery in our arbitration proceedings before the various arbitration associations is left largely to the discretion of the arbitrators themselves, and in practice, that means largely to the discretion of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.048" offset="14589522">There is no doubt that an arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators can say we simply won't permit discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.603" offset="14619824">The practice before most of the major arbitration associations is that the parties attempt to agree upon the scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.158" offset="14653992">There is, to be sure, a limitation on compulsory discovery at least with respect to tribunals sitting overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.084" offset="14681682">Tribunals sitting in the United States, of course, can't avail themselves of the domestic courts, and for example, they issue subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.598" offset="14707805">The suggestion by the Solicitor General that antitrust cases cannot be effectively adjudicated in arbitration is of course belied by the fact that in an after-dispute clause, apparently everybody agrees it is perfectly appropriate to adjudicate antitrust disputes, and that the law and the nonappealability issues do not seem to bother anybody, including the Solicitor General in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.164" offset="14802054">More significantly, however, is that the convention was passed, was adopted and ratified by this nation in order to implement the kind of uniformity and certainty in the international scene that was discussed in Bremen and in Scherk, that for international business to thrive, it is necessary that people of different cultural and legal background with natural suspicion have uniformity.</text>
