            <label>Mr. Matthew J. Zinn</label>
            <text syncTime="79.324" offset="452901">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="82.416" offset="465231">This case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.617" offset="482054">At issue is the validity of Alabama's domestic preference tax statute under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.375" offset="521133">Alabama grants a tax preference to domestic life insurance companies by imposing a tax of one percent on their gross premiums, while imposing a tax of three percent or three times that amount on the gross premiums of out-of-state life insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.937" offset="599396">Alabama grants a tax preference to domestic property casualty insurance companies by imposing a tax on their gross premiums of one percent and imposing a tax on the gross premiums of out-of-state property casualty companies of four times that amount or four percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.159" offset="680271">So in its basic structure the Alabama domestic preference tax statute provides for taxing out-of-state life companies at triple the rate of domestic life companies and providing for taxing out-of-state property casualty companies at quadruple the rate of domestic companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.214" offset="768460">The Alabama domestic preference tax statute also contains a so-called investment incentive provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.710" offset="802419">Under this provision, an out-of-state company can reduce its tax by one-tenth of one percent for each one percent of its total assets that it invests in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.231" offset="864591">However, there's a limitation on the amount of the reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.014" offset="879637">The maximum reduction cannot exceed one percentage point, and this occurs if an out-of-state company invests ten percent or more of its total assets in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.684" offset="930315">What this means is that if an out-of-state company takes maximum advantage of the investment incentive, if it's a life insurance company it can then reduce its tax rate four four percent... from three percent to two percent, or double the rate of a domestic company; and if it's a property casualty insurance company, it can then reduce its tax rate from three percent to two percent... four percent to three percent, or triple the rate of a domestic company.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.213" offset="1056434">Now, these suits for refund were brought in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County for refund of the discriminatory taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.959" offset="1091438">The Appellants here are a number of out-of-state insurance companies that do a nationwide business, including business in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.664" offset="1126233">The Appellees are the insurance commissioner of Alabama, who denied Appellants' claims for refund, and several Alabama insurance companies which intervened in these proceedings below.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.193" offset="1184434">The ultimate issue is whether Alabama's domestic preference tax statue satisfies the rational basis test of equal protection review.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.863" offset="1235112">In holding that it did, the courts below found that at least two of the 17 purposes advanced by the Appellees were legitimate state purposes that justified the discrimination inherent in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.171" offset="1292268">These were: first, encouraging the formation of new insurance companies in Alabama; and second, encouraging capital investment in Alabama by out-of-state companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.022" offset="1351722">Our position is that in the context of this case involving domestic preference taxation neither these two purposes nor any of the other purposes advanced by Alabama are legitimate state purposes as that term has been interpreted by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.069" offset="1459869">We believe that three major considerations should guide decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.465" offset="1489440">The first of these is that this precise issue has been considered by this Court on seven occasions and on each of those seven occasions domestic preference taxation has been held to violate equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.266" offset="1556731">Now, the Appellees contend that these cases were really commerce clause cases and that the purposes that they are putting forward were not put before the Court in these seven cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.554" offset="1605841">So there is a difference of opinion as to whether these cases are on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.696" offset="1626426">A great deal of discussion of the cases in the briefs of the parties--</text>

            <text syncTime="377.880" offset="1647115">Well, Mr. Zinn, I take it you have to concede that in this case protectionist purposes in light of the commerce clause, the fact you can't rely on the commerce clause, are permissible for the state?</text>

            <text syncTime="391.839" offset="1703017">We rely exclusively on the equal protection clause, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.160" offset="1716287">But these seven cases that we rely upon were all equal protection cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.584" offset="1733946">Well, but just arguing perhaps from the point of view cf res nova or whatever you want to call it, you know, something that hadn't been decided before, if you can't claim that a protectionist purpose is illegitimate under the commerce clause, any legislative purpose is legitimate, virtually, under the equal protection clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.365" offset="1869051">Well, if you state the purpose at a level of generality, such as a purpose to encourage rural insurance, to pick one of the 17 purposes that the Appellees have identified... that is one of their 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.665" offset="1922237">They say that there is a lack of insurance in rural areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.529" offset="1945747">If you say that that's the purpose and then the statistics show that domestic companies are servicing rural areas, therefore you're furthering the purpose, then it seems to us that the equal protection clause falls between the two-pronged test that this Court is applying.</text>

            <text syncTime="481.949" offset="2063402">But our stress here is on the legitimacy of the purpose, and what we are saying is... let me see if I can put a hypothetical, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.773" offset="2098720">Suppose instead of the statute that we were dealing with, we had a statute that started all property casualty insurance companies out at a four percent rate, but that provided that if you sold a lot of rural insurance then you would be reduced to a one percent rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.687" offset="2182416">And suppose also that that for opportunity reduction to one percent was available only to domestic companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.525" offset="2221704">Now, we would submit in that situation that, sure you've passed the rationalist test, but the only reason for confining the incentive to domestic companies is local favoritism, and that favoritism has always been held in violation of equal protection.</text>

            <label>Mr. Matthew J. Zinn</label>
            <text syncTime="578.781" offset="2450746">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="582.714" offset="2466524">Prior to the noon recess, Justice Rehnquist had asked a question as to why it isn't okay to help domestic companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.250" offset="2500588">I guess our answer is that if that is the ultimate purpose of the statute it's not okay because it simply restates the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.915" offset="2535278">Now, if it's not the ultimate purpose of the statute, as is suggested by the state's 17 purposes in this case, and you look at those 17 purposes, you will find that foreign companies can contribute to those goals just as domestic companies can.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.619" offset="2618139">And I put the hypothetical before the noon recess of a statute that imposed a four percent tax on both foreign companies and domestic companies, but which allowed a reduction to one percent if, for example, a large number of rural policies were sold, but limited that possibility to domestic companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.009" offset="2747706">In that situation we think it's clear that the only purpose of that statute could be to favor domestic companies, because there's no reason other than that that could explain the discrimination inherent in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.409" offset="2801205">Seven times this Court has had this issue before it and seven times it has held that domestic preference taxes violate the equal protection clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.919" offset="2859301">As we discussed prior to the noon recess, the Appellees contend that these cases are not on point for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.094" offset="2899948">First, they say they're commerce clause cases; and second, they say that the purposes they are putting forward, these 17 purposes, were never put forward before.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.541" offset="2937773">Both of these contentions, we submit, are without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.404" offset="2957208">There is long discussion in all of the briefs of these 17 cases... of these seven cases, and I will just touch on a few highlights.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.680" offset="2994302">Southern Railway versus Greene was the first of the seven cases, and the Appellees make much of the fact that in that 1910 decision two commerce clause cases were cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.999" offset="3043621">But those two cases were cited only on the question of whether the privilege tax doctrine was applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.153" offset="3076222">Once the Court decided that the privilege tax doctrine was not applicable, the rest of the discussion in Southern Railway versus Greene was equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.818" offset="3110912">In fact, the Court said in that case, 75 years ago, that for a classification to be valid under the equal protection it must bear</text>
            <text syncTime="753.435" offset="3149365">"a reasonable and just relation to the things in respect of which such classification is imposed. "</text>

            <text syncTime="761.781" offset="3182697">Mr. Zinn, do you think those cases that are pre-McCarran-Ferguson Act and don't deal with insurance are really relevant here?</text>

            <text syncTime="859.646" offset="3574220">And I would point out that, although there were dissents in some of these seven cases, not one dissent in all of these seven cases ever rested on the basis that this classification was reasonable, not one dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.697" offset="3634406">Seven times since 1910 and not a single Justice that has heard these seven cases has ever said the classification was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.893" offset="3675157">I think it's also particularly significant, Justice Rehnquist, that the Reserve Life case came after Wheeling Steel in the sequence of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.899" offset="3715177">Wheeling Steel was decided in 1949, and I think it's a notable decision of this Court for various reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.193" offset="3744434">The case was decided by a seven to two vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.626" offset="3758122">The dissent in that case was written by Justice Douglas and Justice Black joined in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.610" offset="3782050">The dissent was on the ground that the equal protection clause did not apply to corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.655" offset="3810263">Justice Jackson wrote for the majority in that case and he also, in an unusual procedure, filed a separate statement dealing exclusively with the views of the dissenting Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.225" offset="3864493">In his opinion for the Court, in which the domestic preference tax issue and classification was raised, he made what I think is the clearest statement of what the rule of this Court has been for 75 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.745" offset="3926560">He said that in the area of taxation</text>

            <text syncTime="1002.661" offset="4146302">There are two major taxes that apply to the insurance industry, state taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.463" offset="4165423">One is the domestic preference tax that's in issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.637" offset="4182142">We would agree that in this particular situation the equal protection clause would do what the commerce clause would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.250" offset="4212653">But three years ago this Court considered retaliatory taxes and it held that they passed equal protection review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.356" offset="4241074">On the other hand, in that case I think it's clear that they would not pass commerce clause review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.789" offset="4262808">In fact, the Appellees conceded that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.331" offset="4272943">So we would have to disagree that the tests simply coincide and that the McCarran Act doesn't mean anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.207" offset="4296454">I want to mention again that the seventh case in the line of cases that we are relying upon was the WHYY case, which came three years after Reserve Life, and in that case as well the Court felt comfortable with a per curiam opinion, and it cited the Reserve life case along with Wheeling Steel and several of the other cases in this line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.533" offset="4405750">So we don't think there could be any question, really, that these seven cases are dead on point, and that if the Court is going to affirm the judgment below in this case it's going to have to overrule seven of its own precedents, dating back to 1910.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.901" offset="4575232">--Absolutely, and one of the arguments that the Appellees make in this case is that they say it is more difficult to regulate out-of-state companies than it is domestic companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.788" offset="4626746">We don't agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.531" offset="4633747">But even if it's true, it doesn't follow from that that you can tax out-of-state companies more for that reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.547" offset="4673766">Let me turn again to the Reserve life case, because I think it is very instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.031" offset="4699784">We have in an appendix to our jurisdictional statement submitted the brief that Ohio filed in the Reserve Life case, and we have also lodged with the Clerk of this Court the transcript of the oral argument in the Reserve Life case, and we have excerpted that transcript, the relevant portions of it, in the appendix to our brief on the merits on pages 13a to 16a.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.303" offset="4824859">Now, in this case the court below found that one of the primary... one of the two purposes that justified domestic preference taxation in Alabama was</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.461" offset="4889433">"encouraging the formation of domestic insurance companies in Alabama. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.355" offset="4913048">That's at page 9a of the appendix to our jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.829" offset="4934886">Now, on page 59a of the same appendix appears the Ohio brief, and Ohio argued that its purpose was</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.058" offset="4991833">"to encourage the location of insurance companies in Ohio. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.093" offset="5012000">--almost the same words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.653" offset="5018269">And the oral argument is to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.197" offset="5036450">On page 15a of the appendix to our brief on the merits, the counsel for Ohio argued that the State of Ohio had</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.589" offset="5094024">"a desire to foster the development and creation of insurance companies within the state. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.082" offset="5115967">And then at the bottom of the same page he said</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.084" offset="5127983">"the State of Ohio, in seeking to encourage the location and development of insurance companies in the State of Ohio. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.301" offset="5164868">And then finally, on the bottom of page 16a, the last page that we excerpt, counsel said the legislature of the State of Ohio intends</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.636" offset="5202171">"to encourage the location of insurance companies in the State of Ohio. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.461" offset="5221502">This case is, we submit, a replay of the Reserve life case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.496" offset="5253580">The same arguments that were made by Ohio in that case were made by Alabama here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.599" offset="5274060">We think it gives much too little credit to all of the Justices who heard all of these seven cases for Alabama to suggest that the purpose to encourage the location of companies in Alabama is something that nobody ever thought of in the prior seven cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.863" offset="5363086">That's the most obvious purpose in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.333" offset="5368937">If you give a domestic preference to a local company, of course it's going to encourage the location of companies in your state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.280" offset="5400702">And as far as the remaining purposes that Alabama relies on, the 17 purposes, those are purposes that any company, foreign or domestic, can accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.359" offset="5465068">There's no inherent characteristic of a domestic company that makes it better suited to sell policies in rural areas, or to sell small policies rather than big ones, or industrial policies, or any of the other types of advantages that the state contends those companies are offering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.884" offset="5551167">So the first critical point, we think, it the resolution of this case is recognition by this Court that these seven cases are right on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.123" offset="5600068">And this brings me to the second major consideration which we think should guide the decision here, and that is the concerns that we think the Court has felt in reaching its conclusions in these seven cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.472" offset="5657538">The first concern it seems to us is that we're talking here about unlimited discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.120" offset="5704140">In this case we're talking triple and quadruple taxation of out-of-state companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.623" offset="5734129">But there is no suggestion that that relationship has any bearing whatsoever to the goals that Alabama is seeking to achieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.151" offset="5776238">Now, we recognize that mathematical precision is not required under the equal protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.846" offset="5802988">We don't think that total imprecision is the goal, either, and it just seems to us that these numbers have nothing to do with the goals and they're possibly unlimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.742" offset="5846560">I think another factor that has influenced the Court in these seven cases is that out-of-state companies have no representation in the legislature of Alabama and there is no protection for them whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="1653.220" offset="6748516">In the Metropolitan Casualty case, which involved a similar issue, Justice O'Connor, this Court in 1935 said that it was permissible for a domestic company to provide by contract for a slightly shorter statute of limitations than a foreign company... security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.554" offset="6837854">That case was decided in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.455" offset="6849453">That was just one year after this Court had decided in 1934 in the Concordia Fire case by a vote to eight to nothing on this point that domestic preference taxation was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.984" offset="6899503">And in the Metropolitan Casualty case, I think that the quotation from that case most clearly explains the difference between the two:</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.812" offset="6938896">"The ultimate test of validity", the Court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.282" offset="6952793">"is not whether foreign corporations differ from domestics, but whether the differences between them are pertinent to the subject with respect to which the classification is made. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.819" offset="6990932">When you're talking about security and statute of limitations, it was pertinent, the Court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.874" offset="7011099">When you're talking about taxation, it was not pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.694" offset="7026354">Our ultimate point here is we do not seek a free ride in Alabama or any other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.912" offset="7067314">We ask only for a chance to be equal and to be taxed equally if we contribute to the state's goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.206" offset="7096467">If we provide rural policies, if we sell small policies, if we provide jobs in the state, if we put assets in the state, then we think we ought to be taxed the same way as domestic companies are taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.557" offset="7153832">In 1910 when this Court first considered this issue in the Southern Railway case, it concluded that domestic preference taxation</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.299" offset="7296774">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.892" offset="7311193">This is a case of first impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.025" offset="7319761">This Court has never considered a discriminatory tax against foreign insurance companies in which the state has presented this Court with a record to show you the difference in benefits conferred on the citizens of that state by the domestic companies as opposed to the foreign companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.013" offset="7383709">Even in Western &amp; Southern, as the dissent pointed out, there was no difference shown between domestic companies and foreign companies insofar as the State of California was shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.000" offset="7427595">It's a case of first impression, but under the tests that this Court has framed repeatedly... such as, is there a legitimate state purpose, and are the means rationally related to achieving that purpose... our statute passes muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.169" offset="7484333">The foreign insurance companies say that we are discriminating here on the basis of a political difference, that is state of incorporation, and simply we are raising revenue at the expense of out-of-state corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.529" offset="7545773">The fact is our statute discriminates on the basis of benefits to the State of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.902" offset="7567193">Not only must you incorporate in the State of Alabama; you must also locate in the State of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.116" offset="7592062">And if you don't do either of those, you will have to pay a higher tax, which may be reduced by investing in assets in the State of Alabama, specified assets.</text>

            <text syncTime="1873.313" offset="7628842">Doesn't that offset the whole burden?</text>

            <text syncTime="1876.976" offset="7643471">No, sir, it never will, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.918" offset="7655278">The discrimination is four to one for foreign property and casualty insurers and it's three to one for life insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.791" offset="7678788">It can be reduced to three to one for property and casualty and two to one for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.004" offset="7699686">It can never be the same, and the reason for that is because domestic insurers are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.250" offset="7720584">They perform a different service to Alabama and to the insureds in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.942" offset="7739392">The burden we say here is on the foreign insurance companies to show the Court that every conceivable purpose that could be behind our statute and to negative those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.880" offset="7787144">If they fail in that burden, our statute is due to be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.293" offset="7800832">Even if you apply a lesser burden here and say what is the actual purpose, we submit to you that you can get the actual purpose of our statute from reading it on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.676" offset="7838344">It encourages the formation of insurance companies in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.409" offset="7853286">It encourages investment in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.100" offset="7864049">And we say those are legitimate state purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.952" offset="7875438">This Court has said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.266" offset="7884633">This Court most recently said it in Western &amp; Southern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.026" offset="7891739">The Court said it is a legitimate state purpose to promote a local industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.479" offset="7913577">Now, the foreign insurers say you must take it one more step and say, you can promote that local industry if you do it in interstate competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.946" offset="7943357">That's not what this Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.086" offset="7951925">This Court said to promote a local industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.599" offset="7966031">It so happens that in Western &amp; Southern those California insurance companies were benefited in the interstate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.812" offset="7994870">It so happens in our case the Alabama companies are benefited in their intrastate market and in their early formative years, when they need a tax shelter, we submit to this Court, and the evidence is before you that this is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.443" offset="8049414">The Western &amp; Southern case is the test that this Court has given us, and we passed that test by looking for a legitimate state purpose... promotion of a local industry... and have we used a reasonable means to get there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.522" offset="8105734">The commerce clause is designed to promote federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.115" offset="8120049">The equal protection clause has never been an instrument of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.469" offset="8137499">This Court has said the equal protection clause has never been given that characteristic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.061" offset="8155889">It is simply to assure equal treatment for those entities in the same classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.565" offset="8177832">So you come to the matter of classification here, and this Court has repeatedly said the states are free to classify as they see fit, especially in the area of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.751" offset="8218583">The states have the widest possible latitude to classify in the area of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.303" offset="8236868">And the burden is here on the foreign insurance companies to show you that the classification is not rational, is not reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.549" offset="8265812">In fact, this Court has said from time to time the burden is on them to show you that it's palpably arbitrary, that it has no rational basis, and it's not reasonably related to achieving the purpose that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.278" offset="8316699">Really, it's a higher burden on them than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.889" offset="8331223">They're supposed to show you that our legislature couldn't rationally have believed that classification would accomplish the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.874" offset="8359121">If you assume in the abstract that promotion of local industry and encouraging investment are legitimate state purposes, with all the benefits attendant on those two goals, then you come to whether the means chosen by our legislature are rationally related to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.364" offset="8425054">And they've said you must incorporate, locate your principal place of business there, or else pay a higher tax, unless you reduce it by investments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.340" offset="8460999">As to whether those means, those classifications, are reasonably related to achieving our purpose, we have about 120 pages of facts that have been stipulated to by the foreign insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.851" offset="8515020">They say it--</text>
