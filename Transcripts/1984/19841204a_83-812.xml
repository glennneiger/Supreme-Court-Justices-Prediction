            <text syncTime="16.743" offset="202933">The question in this case is whether a statute providing a minute of silence for meditation or voluntary prayer constitutes an establishment of religion, or whether it constitutes a common sense accommodation of the religious diversity of our people which is consistent with the purposes of the religion causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.125" offset="292481">Alabama statute provides an opportunity to pray for so minded students, but this opportunity to pray is one that is perfectly consistent with the letter and the spirit of this Court's cases under the establishment clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.920" offset="363639">Moreover, we submit that this type of accommodation is one that is perfectly consistent with the spirit of the religion clauses in that it promotes pluralism which pervades both of the religion clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.429" offset="425706">This type of a statute involves none of the circumstances that have concerned this Court in prior cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.070" offset="468338">This kind of a statute does not endorse religion, it does not endorse one religion over another, it does not endorse belief over nonbelief.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.926" offset="511701">This kind of a statute is perfectly neutral on its face.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.282" offset="1469141">The difference between the Appellee and our own position on this question really comes down to the significance of the word "prayer" in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.655" offset="1506653">As I have already said, the Appellee concedes the constitutionality of the moment of silence statute for meditation, and the Appellee also concedes that students have a right to pray silently to themselves at any time that they would wish to during the school day.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.949" offset="1575825">Obviously, then, during this one minute of silence, the students, even under the 1978 statute, the statute providing only for silent meditation, the student would have the right during that minute to pray silently.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.793" offset="1639146">In other words, the effect under either statute, under the 1978 statute or the 1981 statute, is the same as far as the classroom goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.001" offset="1680001">The difference comes down to that one-word prayer in the statute, but certainly it cannot be unconstitutional simply to insert in a statute a statement that it is constitutional... what is constitutionally permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.676" offset="1742695">In other words, the statute merely informs students that one of the purposes that they can put this minute of silence to is that they can use it to pray silently during that minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.651" offset="1790656">This opportunity for prayer is not, as the Appellee has suggested, one of group prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.524" offset="1830153">We have here none of the characteristics of group prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.828" offset="1847289">It is not vocal prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.780" offset="1855126">No one student knows what another student is saying, is thinking, or whether that student is praying, whether the student is meditating, whether the student is simply vegetating for that one minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.170" offset="1908729">Because no student knows what another student is doing during that period of time, there is not the problem of coercion that concerned this Court in earlier cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.613" offset="1966512">We do not have here a joint effort or joint purpose as among the various students in the classroom for that one minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.203" offset="2000785">There is, in other words, no communal effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.738" offset="2010920">It does not involve any of the characteristics that this Court discussed in Engel and in Shemp, and we submit on this basis that this statute is essentially different.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.128" offset="2060553">By providing an opportunity to pray, we submit that the statute is in the line of cases including Zorach where this Court has recognized that it is perfectly consistent for states to in certain areas accommodate the religious needs of our people.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.661" offset="2150623">In this area of accommodation, we find that the statute accommodates those admittedly who have this desire to pray, but it does so in a way that in no way interferes with the free exercise of rights of anyone else in the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.741" offset="2239022">It does not present the problem of embarrassment or excusing students as was a problem in the earlier cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.911" offset="2267652">The statute does in fact, as indicated, leave to the teacher a certain discretion in the sense that this statute is permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.684" offset="2302760">It says that a teacher may implement this minute of silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.088" offset="2324390">This statute, however, is not inconsistent with the notion that local school boards in their independent areas would or could adopt regulations dealing with the implementation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.045" offset="2372142">But the sense of the statute is that this moment of silence should be allowed for students who wish to have their religious needs accommodated during the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.936" offset="2411743">We see no difference constitutionally between a statute which is permissive, as this statute is in the sense that it has the word "may" in it, as opposed to a statute which is mandatory, as was indicated in one of the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.363" offset="2473497">We have from the 24 states that have moment of silence statutes, we have a variety of language in those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.902" offset="2511636">In some of the states the decision is made by the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.205" offset="2528876">In other states the decision is made by the state school board or the local school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.674" offset="2550715">It may be made by the principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.393" offset="2557611">It may be made by the teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.395" offset="2565552">In viewing these statutes in terms of the fact that we have 24 states which have deemed this to be a proper, reasonable way to accommodate, we have to take into account the fact that there are various conditions from state to state, and that the statute may in fact be implemented in somewhat a different way in various states depending upon the local needs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.490" offset="6857993">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.626" offset="6870532">I think what has become clear here is that this is not a case about accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.613" offset="6890489">I think the prior opinions of this Court has made clear that to accommodate the free exercise rights of individuals and citizens of this nation, there must be a burden placed upon those rights by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.004" offset="6940018">Here the state has shown no burden placed upon the rights of young children in the Alabama public school system prohibiting the free exercise of their religious rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.526" offset="6978156">I think as has been pointed out, the earlier statute, the 1978 statute that provides for a moment of silent meditation, adequately provides time for reflection, introspection, meditation, whatever a child feels a need to engage in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.905" offset="7043671">There was no need for this new statute, the 1981 statute, but simply the major part, the major change simply added the word "prayer".</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.361" offset="7081497">I think it is a a clear attempt on the part of the state to promote religion, to promote religious practice, and one of the most basic of religious practices, and that is prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.300" offset="7121203">The whole idea behind the accommodation doctrine was to assure that a person fares no worse for being religious than a nonreligious person subject to the same governmental activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.107" offset="7168432">There has been no showing here, and I will point out that the record is clear, there is no hindrance to any child from praying during their period of time of meditation under the 1978 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.802" offset="7231231">Senator Holmes, the sponsor of that particular statute, of the new statute, the 1981 statute, testified in District Court that it was his purpose to return prayer to Alabama public schools, that is constituents had advised him that they felt a need to have prayer in school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.680" offset="7302702">Now, the new statute was impermissive, and if there is going to be any type of accommodation, how do you accommodate when you allow a teacher the discretion to make the determination of whether or not that statute will be applied or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1833.507" offset="7469990">No, initially, when this case first started, the activity being complained about was teacher-led group, vocal prayer in the public school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.863" offset="7511472">Later, as the case progressed, this complaint was amended when it became clear because of other people coming forward, that other religious activity was taking place in the public school system as well, including silent prayer, Bible reading over the public address system, just a variety of religious activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.777" offset="7587123">The District Court did not allow plaintiff to get into the details of all that... those activities, so the main focus of the case became the teacher-led prayer, the recently enacted Bob James Prayer, and this new silent meditation or prayer statute.</text>
