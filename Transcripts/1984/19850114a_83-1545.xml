            <text syncTime="59.820" offset="374178">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.503" offset="388911">According to the order granting certiorari in this case, this matter is before the Court for you to decide the proper burden of proof in connection with a defense of reasonable factors other than age arising under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as well as the appropriate standard for establishing a bona fide occupational qualification, a BFOQ, under the same Act in a situation where the safety of third parties is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.474" offset="524852">Petitioner will limit its comments to those legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.188" offset="539690">Petitioner understands that this case is not before the Court on any issue involving the sufficiency of the evidence below or the nature, quality or quantity of such evidence, and therefore will not comment on the evidence except where necessary to clarify its positions or concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.511" offset="624954">Of course, Petitioner relies on the record and the briefs, and does not concede any evidentiary questions--</text>
            <text syncTime="128.555" offset="649195">The Federal Aviation Administration sets minimum safety standards for air carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.190" offset="675736">It does not in any way attempt to set safety standards as such, but leaves to the carriers the methods, approaches, procedures and techniques that allow them in each of their own judgments to maximize safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.211" offset="751804">The carriers do in fact operate with substantially different approaches and philosophies.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.895" offset="774479">The flight engineer's job, for example, is different from carrier to carrier, particularly in the training aspects and emergency procedures and in the airlines' approach to the management of flight, whether the carrier utilizes a coordinated crew approach to flying.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.027" offset="847099">Some carriers treat their flight engineer's job as a lifetime position.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.643" offset="877505">Others, among them Western, hire only pilots and do not hire those only qualified to be flight engineers, and treat the flight engineer or second officer slot as an entry level job on a line of progression leading to pilot.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.271" offset="939990">Of course, all common carriers own their passengers a duty of extraordinary care.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.737" offset="965904">This is not a new concept, but rather has been the standard for many, if not hundreds, of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.952" offset="990772">It is viewed as fair and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.503" offset="1001012">The carrier is in control of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.585" offset="1013238">The carrier has superior knowledge and experience by virtue of being in the business, and therefore is in the best position to know and to assess the risk involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.022" offset="1055034">The carrier delivers this care through hundreds, if not thousands, of small decisions, decisions regarding the manner of operation, the type of equipment to be used, the manner of repair, maintenance and replacement of equipment, schedules and the speeds required to be utilized to meet those schedules, as well as decisions regarding the competence level required of employees, the training required, the proficiency required, and other personnel decisions, all involving human skills, human weaknesses, and human abilities... decisions which, taken together, allow the carrier to predict a safe operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.270" offset="1236010">All of these decisions are made subject to the requirement that the carrier operate to an extraordinary level of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.987" offset="1274880">The airline common carriers are charged by statute with the duty to make their decisions so as to maximize safety, to operate in the highest degree of safety in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.954" offset="1318766">In practice, all common carriers probably strive to meet that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.508" offset="1336947">All try to make decisions in such a way that a safe operation is predictable.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.132" offset="1359517">It is also a federal law that employment and other personnel decisions shall not be made in such a way as to arbitrarily discriminate among people based on their age.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.200" offset="1415732">And it is also the common experience of mankind that certain abilities and capacities diminish with age.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.939" offset="1458678">The difficulty is with adequately measuring or predicting such diminution in an appropriate way.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.182" offset="1487726">And this case involves those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.275" offset="1500056">There are two sets of Plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.587" offset="1513326">Some were captains who sought to become second officers as they approached age 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.480" offset="1536836">The second officer is the most junior person in the cockpit.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.364" offset="1552405">He occupies the flight engineer position.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.015" offset="1562959">It is the entry level job.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.416" offset="1572572">Some of the Plaintiffs were part of a group of ten second officers who in 1962 were permitted to remain as second officers as an exception to the company's up-or-out policy normally applied to the second officer, first officer, captain line of progression.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.310" offset="1656163">These second officers wanted to continue as second officers after reaching age 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.583" offset="1685316">As to the captain group of Plaintiffs, the Defendant asserted that such bids would invert the normal seniority in the cockpit by allowing the most senior person in the cockpit to become the most junior in the chain of command.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.293" offset="1744144">The company has a firmly established up-or-out policy for safety reasons, and the inversion would be inconsistent with that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.320" offset="1776222">The company asserted that the Plaintiff captains had no right to make such bids, as they were not allowed under the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.015" offset="1814988">No captains were allowed to make such bids under the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.691" offset="1837662">The company advanced this as a reasonable factor other than age under the ADEA.</text>

            <text syncTime="1216.098" offset="4999314">As I was saying, the Fifth Circuit said that the employer must demonstrate that the qualification be reasonably related to the employer's business and that the employer prove that he had a factual basis for believing that all or substantially all persons excluded would be unable to perform safely and efficiently the duties of the job involved, or demonstrate that it is impossible or highly impractical to deal with the excluded persons on an individualized basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.381" offset="5144451">The court then discussed refinements to be considered in a case where safety was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.027" offset="5179037">The court observed:</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.429" offset="5188650">"The greater the safety factor, measured by the likelihood of harm and the probable severity of that harm in case of an accident, the more stringent may be the job qualifications designed to ensure in that case safe driving. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.798" offset="5246119">"We believe that courts must afford employers substantial, though not absolute, discretion in selecting specific safety standards and in judging their reasonableness. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.684" offset="5285721">The court concluded by saying that:</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.907" offset="5306619">"In the safety area, the employer must be afforded substantial discretion in selecting specific standards which, if they err at all, should err on the side of preservation of life and limb. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.866" offset="5354371">"The employer must, of course, show a reasonable basis for its assessment of risk of injury or death. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.591" offset="5381329">"We think the safety factor should be evaluated in terms of the possibility or lack of it of injury or death. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.735" offset="5409855">We suggest to you that in cases involving considerations of public safety an appropriate standard would be to require the employer to show: first, that the duties of the job in question are related to the essence of the business; and secondly, that the qualifications selected by the employer for that job are reasonable in light of the safety risk; and that there is a reasonable cause to believe... that is, a factual basis for believing... either that most persons excluded by the challenged age limitation do not possess the selected qualifications or that it is impossible or impractical to deal with such persons on an individual basis, thereby justifying a reasonable general rule; and further, that where the purpose of a challenged employment policy is to promote safety and minimize risk of injury to third parties, the employer should be afforded flexibility and discretion in selecting specific safety standards and in judging their reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.534" offset="5709114">Petitioner submits that these requirements are totally consistent with the opinion in Tamiami and with the better reasoned decisions following Tamiami.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.621" offset="5749447">This Court, of course, is not bound by Tamiami nor its progeny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.126" offset="5767419">Petitioner submits that, whatever test this Court devises for use in cases involving safety consideration, that this Court should accord the employer flexibility and properly restrained discretion in selecting job qualifications stringent enough to ensure safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.538" offset="5853101">The charge given by the trial court in this case did not afford Western any flexibility or discretion in selecting job qualifications for the position of second officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.925" offset="5898658">Moreover, it did not permit Western to make a conservative management decision when faced with substantial conflicting medical evidence concerning the efficacy of medical individual tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.604" offset="5957381">Every court which has considered the issue of safety and the BFOQ claim has concluded that some leeway, some margin for error, is to be afforded the employer, except the lower courts in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1924.295" offset="7832137">The record will reflect that one of the chief management officials was asked about this on cross-examination and he explicitly said that Western was making no contention about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.971" offset="7870799">It has not been raised in one brief in the Court of Appeals or in the Supreme Court, and the first time I've heard of it in this case is today's oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.318" offset="7908206">Secondly, the reasonable factors other than age defense in this case as it was pleaded, as it was briefed, and as it was tried related only to the contractual restriction on down-bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.767" offset="7962018">In fact, the reasonable factors defense was almost exclusively based on the arbitration decision, which said that the down-bids were improper under a particular provision of the pilot agreement, not because the literal language of the pilot agreement wouldn't allow it, but because to grant the bids to Criswell and Starley would violate the company's policy against mandatory retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.304" offset="8056163">There was no argument in this case about the inversion of seniority in the cockpit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.198" offset="8087719">There was no evidence presented by Western to show that that would be a safety factor under either reasonable factors or BFOQ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.522" offset="8117081">Now, with regard to the instructions, Western initially tendered about ten BFOQ instructions, which are identified in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.109" offset="8155429">The correct citation to the record is number 164 of the clerk's record, which is not reproduced in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.213" offset="8179775">In all of those instructions, the drift of the instruction was that Western could prove a BFOQ by articulating a rational basis for its safety belief that a life would be endangered by abandoning its policy of mandatory retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.922" offset="8246648">It relied exclusively on the district court opinion in the Tuohy case, which was reversed by the Sixth Circuit, and it relied upon the Seventh Circuit's decision in Greyhound, which was clarified later by the Seventh Circuit in Orzel to fall in line with Tamiami and the test which almost every court has adopted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2155.186" offset="8755723">Well, the clarifying language would have, in Judge Tashima's ruling, essentially directed the matter for Western, because it says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.713" offset="8785816">"If you find that second officers perform duties on a DC-10 such that their incapacitation would to any extent whatever decrease the safety of or increase the risk to passengers in Western aircraft, then I instruct you that you may find that the existence of the FAA rule by itself constitutes a sufficient basis for you to find that a BFOQ existed.

            <text syncTime="2187.727" offset="8885812">So in other words, they had inserted on the second page a rational basis test again.</text>

            <text syncTime="2200.757" offset="8937953">Western had said, well, we shouldn't be held to what medical science can now do; we should only be held to what was practical back in 1978.</text>

            <label>Mr. Raymond C. Fay</label>
            <text syncTime="2236.141" offset="9079537">One more item of clarification regarding the state of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.032" offset="9099076">Perhaps Mr. Booth inadvertently stated that the BFOQ defense did not apply to the captains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.350" offset="9132304">The BFOQ defense was asserted against all the Plaintiffs in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.651" offset="9149545">On the down-bidding issue, the refusal to allow the captains to transfer, that was defended by various defenses... reasonable factors other than age, bona fide seniority system, business necessity... at various stages of the case, and all of that applied only to the captain plaintiffs, Criswell and Starley, who sought to down bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.747" offset="9237943">The BFOQ instruction in this case should be upheld for two key reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.550" offset="9257169">First, the Tamiami BFOQ test, without the adulteration proposed by Western in its brief, satisfies the statutory requirement of a reasonably necessary BFOQ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.119" offset="9311399">First, it requires reasonableness in the selection of the job qualifications which are related to the essence of the business, here safety; and second, it requires necessity in the application of the age limit, in the sense that it would be impossible or highly impractical for the employer to conduct the business without the limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.173" offset="9395618">That was contained in the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.006" offset="9402932">The Tamiami test has worked well in literally dozens of BFOQ cases and has been embraced by every circuit to consider the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.771" offset="9438041">Now, the Tamiami test was applied by Judge Tashima in this case with two modifications which lightened Western's Tamiami burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.837" offset="9486315">First, instead of having to prove that the flight engineer job qualifications and duties were reasonably related to safety, Western received a direction to the jury that this prong, called the Diaz prong of the Tamiami test, was met.</text>

            <label>Mr. Raymond C. Fay</label>
            <text syncTime="2364.625" offset="9593417">It's instruction number 28, on page 61 of the joint appendix, where it states:</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.362" offset="9628421">"The BFOQ defense is available only if it is reasonably necessary to the normal operation essence of Defendant's business. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.287" offset="9660082">"In this regard, I instruct you that the normal operation essence of Western's business is the safe transportation of air passengers. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.983" offset="9694877">So Western did not have to put on any evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.754" offset="9705953">As a matter of fact, it objected to the court giving any such instruction on the Diaz prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.627" offset="9725492">Contrary to its argument here that it wasn't allowed to make an argument in this regard, it objected to the court stating this part of the statutory requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.874" offset="9766452">There was an additional modification in the classic Tamiami test which Judge Tashima gave in the instruction which also lightened Western's burden, and that is he omitted the part of the Tamiami test which would have required Western to prove that it had a factual basis to believe that all or substantially all flight engineers over age 60 could not perform the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.701" offset="9877734">So those two elements were omitted, and that's really the only reason why the instruction looks at all different from the Tamiami decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.178" offset="9915664">In both instances it lightened Western's burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.429" offset="9924650">Well, Western advocated the rational basis BFOQ test based on the... principally on the age 60 rule of the FAA, which applies to pilots, not flight engineers, with the gloss that it had a duty under the statute to perform its duties in the highest degree of safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.784" offset="10006048">Well, reliance on the FAA's age 60 rule for a position to which the age 60 rule doesn't apply is insufficient as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.730" offset="10045858">It is clear from this Court's recent opinion in TWA versus Thurston that the BFOQ must apply to a particular position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.295" offset="10080131">So even assuming that the FAA's age 60 rule is a BFOQ for the captain or the copilot, the employer can't make its BFOQ for a different position solely dependent upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.645" offset="10133525">Moreover, there is an abundance of evidence in this record related to the FAA's regulatory scheme and the manner in which Western operated under that scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.231" offset="10175843">There was absolutely no limitation on the manner in which Western was allowed to argue its business as a regulated carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.955" offset="10206772">In fact, all of the evidence was given to the jury in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.658" offset="10221610">In final argument, Western told the jury, we have to operate in the highest degree of safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.361" offset="10244389">The FAA's minimum standards and other standards came into play, and the ability of Western to exceed those standards in areas where it thought it might have a safety problem also came into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.868" offset="10290469">But the jury was also shown that there were over 200 flight engineers at the time... now there are over 500... who are beyond age 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.724" offset="10325891">There was a suggestion in oral argument this morning that the jobs are different from carrier to carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.359" offset="10344385">Not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.240" offset="10347938">There was an expert witness in this case who testified that the job is essentially the same, the flight engineer job is essentially the same from carrier to carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="2889.630" offset="11693453">There were disciplinary downgrades, which weren't even addressed in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.440" offset="11708709">If the company wanted to punish someone, they made him down-bid or downgrade for a while.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.064" offset="11731174">So the factual situation on that score was markedly similar to TWA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.928" offset="11750609">If anything, the facts were stronger here because Starley actually had his down-bid under the contracts and the company cancelled the bid, and the chief pilot at the trial admitted that they singled him out and discriminated on the basis of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.556" offset="11801182">And then when he went to arbitration, the arbitrator found that, yes, the literal language of the contract would allow you to down-bid, but we're not going to allow you to do it to get around the mandatory retirement rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.856" offset="11854368">So that is just another reason why the reasonable factors other than age scheme that we have here is... the argument that they make here is foreclosed by TWA, because, as in TWA, we have a facially discriminatory policy... age 60 captains were the only ones who were not allowed to down-bid in any circumstances... and secondly, that there was a... and secondly, that the bona fide seniority system would not have been a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.646" offset="11989577">By the way, in this case the reasonable factors other than age defense was just one of a number of defenses Western asserted to stop the down-bidding, and on all the other ones... for example, bona fide seniority system and business necessity... there was no question that Western had the burden of proving that, because behind it was this age-bases selection policy, that once you were 60 you could not down-bid.</text>

            <text syncTime="3016.001" offset="12198975">Just to clarify what this case is about factually, on page A-42 of the appendix to the petition for certiorari, in the district court's factual findings the court mentions that Western has permitted down-bids or downgrades by more than 400 pilots.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.710" offset="12313809">This is not a case in which pilots younger than age 60 have not been allowed to downgrade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.097" offset="12355292">Many of these occurred during outbacks of operations, but others were for medical reasons, several pilots who no longer qualified to get a medical certificate that enabled them to be pilots.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.399" offset="12424568">So factually the case is very similar to the TWA case decided last week with respect to this disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.525" offset="12469081">In fact, the court found that the only circumstance in which Western has consistently denied down-bids is by captains nearing age &lt;sixty&gt; [= 60], and there was no--</text>

            <text syncTime="3108.252" offset="12567928">--That is correct, just as there was in the TWA case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.644" offset="12577541">In this case it was admitted that all second officers had to retire at age 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.097" offset="12607321">That's obviously direct evidence of an age-based involuntary retirement requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.952" offset="12638772">And there was no instance in the record in which anyone disqualified to continue as a pilot was not allowed to down-bid or downgrade except those who were nearing age 60, who would be affected by the mandatory retirement requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.818" offset="12730201">So I think the suggestion that has been made by Justice Stevens, that the case basically turns on the BFOQ question, is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.336" offset="12776281">And with respect to that, the legal question of some significance in the case has to do with interpretation of the BFOQ requirement, a now familiar phrase in the law, but one that originated with Title VII of the 1964 Act and was carried forward into the Age Discrimination Act in substantially identical language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.016" offset="12903027">This Court in Dothard against Rawlinson referred to the BFOQ as a "extremely narrow exception", because in both statutes it permits the very conduct that the Act generally prohibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.978" offset="12974812">On its face... and we have quoted the relevant provision from the ADA on page 22 of our brief... the BFOQ on its face strongly suggests that an objective standard is to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.449" offset="13044715">It says that action otherwise prohibited may be taken where age is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary, where it is reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3363.539" offset="13589107">Well, would it be appropriate to at least instruct the jury that, if the employer has a rational basis in fact to think the tests won't screen out individually the people who are at risk, that the employer is not liable under ADEA?</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.368" offset="13656399">--We do not think that is the statutory standard, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.191" offset="13671759">The formulation of the legislative history that we quote on pages 8 and 9 of our brief can be read consistently with the face of the statute, which proposes an objective standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.161" offset="13731631">In the words of Senator Javits, who is explaining it, it's that when it can be proved that the employer can demonstrate that there is an objective factual basis for believing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.670" offset="13785652">Now, there is a possible ambiguity, whether you'd read that that he had a basis, an objective factual basis for believing, or whether you read it that the finder of fact, it's demonstrated to the finder of fact that there is an objective factual basis for believing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.712" offset="13853780">And the more reasonable reading, in light of the plain language of the statute, is that an objective standard is to apply, since the words of the statute present an objective standard and the whole idea that Congress had in both Title VII and the Age Discrimination Act was that persons were being excluded from employment without an adequate basis in fact and that this discrimination should be ended, and the affirmative defense should not be read to defeat the statutory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.966" offset="14006857">In this case there never were safety considerations introduced as a reason at the outset for terminating these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.674" offset="14057639">It was argued as a basis for establishing a BFOQ once the case came to trial, but it wasn't the reason given to these people for their termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.374" offset="14112497">And it's quite possible, in looking at this record, to think that safety considerations might be better served if the employer were to apply more medical tests to all of the flight engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.825" offset="14174250">When one notices the number of cases involving cockpit crews that have been litigated and the fact that the Airline Pilots Association, unlike other unions, has been more resistant to the application of this statute in its particular industry in comparison with its application elsewhere, at first my reaction was that, well, perhaps they're really trying to support opportunities for the younger pilots to make bids for more desirable jobs sooner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.149" offset="14339553">But what this record suggests and some others is another possibility, and I can't say that there is direct evidence on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.494" offset="14364944">But the provisions of the agreement reproduced in the joint appendix starting at page 76 show that the collective bargaining agreement restricts the medical tests that can be given to those required by the FAA, and there are other concerns shown by the employer here that it would be difficult to get the union to agree to additional medical tests being given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.536" offset="14493048">And what is suggested by this is a concern that perhaps some of the younger employees who are not yet eligible for pension benefits would not pass additional medical tests if the need to employ the older persons who don't want to retire were to result in the need to give additional medical tests to all of the flight engineers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3615.503" offset="14596911">The union was not a party in this case and no one from the union testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.837" offset="14610286">But the collective agreement is in evidence and there is testimony concerning the difficulty that the airline might have in getting additional medical tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.492" offset="14652918">So it's quite possible to read this record as suggesting that safety concerns would be better served if additional tests were given to all of these flight engineers, those over age 60 and the others, and that the concern for safety may not cut in just one direction.</text>
