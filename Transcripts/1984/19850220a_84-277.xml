            <text syncTime="95.712" offset="513358">In 1981 in Widmar against Vincent, this Court held that a public university, the University of Missouri, where it had opened its meeting rooms to over 100 various groups of students for various kinds of speech and discussion was forbidden by the free speech clause to deny such a meeting room to a group of students, a cornerstone group, wishing to hold prayer and religious discussion meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.551" offset="660793">In this case here on certiorari to the Second Circuit, that Court has held that the Village of Scarsdale in Westchester, under the rule of Widmar and Vincent, is compelled or required to allow a group of christian churches and their christian adherence to place and leave a creche or nativity scene in a small public park in the center of the village for a period of two weeks or so around the Christmas season.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.401" offset="860160">It seemed to me at least in looking at it the Court of Appeals said that the city could adopt reasonable time, place and manner of restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.725" offset="905508">Presumably those restrictions might incorporate a provision that unattended displays will not be permitted in the park.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.895" offset="1142178">When the case went back to the University of Missouri, presumably they could adopt time, place and manner regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.567" offset="1172793">For example, they could have abolished their meeting rooms.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.036" offset="1186690">What we say is in this case that what Scarsdale has done without time, place and manner regulations so-called is constitutional; that there is no such thing required under the First Amendment as an open public forum for unattended statues, symbols, structures, and signs, and that therefore Widmar and Vincent does not apply to this case; that the Circuit should be reversed as things stand under the way that Scarsdale has run its parks up until now.</text>

            <text syncTime="927.679" offset="3841254">Now, I say that the park in this case, for purposes of unattended structures and symbols, is not an open, public forum; that the uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate that the First Amendment assures for speakers and speech does not extent to cluttering the parks with controversial symbols to stand there and beguile or benumb the residents as they walk in those places.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.198" offset="3967373">Therefore, I say that the doctrine of Perry applies here and Perry said it didn't matter that the alleged forum, the communication device given by the government could be used by the YMCA and some other civic kinds of associations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1795.234" offset="7311464">What the Second Circuit decided in this case was that the only two grounds offered by the village for denial of access to the creche were invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.892" offset="7366112">The first ground which the village offered was the establishment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.028" offset="7386697">The Second Circuit, I submit correctly, held that that argument could not survive Lynch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.515" offset="7412610">The second argument made by the village in the Second Circuit and made explicitly in its brief was that even if the establishment clause was not an adequate justification for denial of access, then the village could not be required to post and to permit controversial device, sectarian symbol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.417" offset="7512189">The Second Circuit made no mention in its opinion of that second ground and I respectfully submit that the reason for that is that the ground is so devoid of constitutional merit that it takes ingenuity and a facility and forensic skills such as only my friend possesses to advance it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.115" offset="7607066">It is significant, may it please the Court, that the only effort to express a point of view which has been denied by the Village of Scarsdale for its park, the only effort to express which has been denied access is the creche.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.844" offset="7685956">For more than 25 years every application to display an unattended symbol in Scarsdale's parks has been granted or the village Trustees have directed the use of a part of the park system other than Boniface Circle.</text>

            <text syncTime="3502.487" offset="14140499">I think the Court should know that the turmoil in Scarsdale which has grown begins in 1960, as the record shows, and continues and accelerates and does not begin with the lawsuit, the abortive lawsuit by the Civil Liberties Union person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.734" offset="14217508">I think in answer to a question put by Justice Stevens, it should be said that this is not a case by any means of viewpoint discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.772" offset="14261603">You just have to read the somewhat anguished expressions of then Mayor Stone who had once voted to allow the creche and came to realize its significance standing there speaking for Scarsdale and changed her vote, who is a christian, who has a creche of her own, to realize that this is not an anti-christian expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.990" offset="14358570">You just have to read the statement of ten christian clergymen quoted at the end of our reply brief against offending their non-christian neighbors, against appropriating the public property for the practice of religion, against mingling religion with the state, even our own religion, to realize this is an effort to keep the village free of the kind of division that has erupted and is not in any sense a discrimination on the basis of viewpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.597" offset="14508930">I think with all the back and forth, the line is clearly drawn and the potential significance for the parks in the cities and villages of America ought to be clean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.988" offset="14554488">The first question is must they open those parks to unattended structures, to swastikas, to creches, to abortion controversies, or may they limit the parks as almost all American parks have been limited to community symbols that the people care about, restricting them in this fashion.</text>
