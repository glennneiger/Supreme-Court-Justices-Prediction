            <label>Mr. Joshua I. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="63.122" offset="393832">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="67.525" offset="411387">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.940" offset="433121">The question presented is whether when the United States takes property belonging to a state or local government for federal use it is obliged by the just compensation clause of the Fifth Amendment to pay compensation measured by reference to the cost of a substitute facility rather than the usual standard in condemnation cases, the fair market value of the property that was taken by the United States, even though in the particular case a market exists for the kind of property that was taken and it is found that the fair market value measure is reasonably ascertainable in the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.266" offset="594348">The Court of Appeals answered the question in the affirmative; the government contends that the answer should be no.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.232" offset="622247">The case arises from the taking of a 50 acre site occupied by a sanitary landfill, occupied by the Respondent, the city of Duncanville, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.616" offset="659759">That site was taken, along with an adjacent site which was in private ownership prior to the taking to accommodate a Corps of Engineers flood control project, the site would be flooded by the project, and therefore the United States was obliged to pay compensation for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.498" offset="727364">The taking was carried out pursuant to the so-called quick take provisions of the Declaration of Taking Act, which was effective on October 3, 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.274" offset="762472">Estimated just compensation of just under $200,000 was deposited into the registry of the court, and it was later released to Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.380" offset="798835">Following the taking, Respondent employed a temporary landfill site which was in private ownership for an interim period and later, approximately two years later, began to use a new site located in Ellis County, Texas, consisting of somewhat over 113 acres that it had purchased and used as a substitute site.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.096" offset="893712">The usable capacity of the substitute site, according to the uncontradicted evidence, was somewhat greater than three times that of the site that the United States had acquired from the City of Duncanville.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.045" offset="949509">A dispute arose in the District Court between the parties as to the proper measure of compensation for the taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.140" offset="977930">The government contended that the usual fair market value standard should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.092" offset="997679">Respondent claimed that it was entitled to recover the entire sum that it alleged it had expended and would in the future expend in improving... in acquiring and improving the substitute site in Ellis County.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.321" offset="1054626">The District Court was unwilling to resolve the issue at the threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.223" offset="1074270">Instead, it determined to allow both theories to go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.748" offset="1092347">Both parties were allowed to present evidence in support of their respective theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.849" offset="1108752">The jury was asked by special questions to return alternative verdicts: one, the finding of substitute facilities standard of compensation; the other, the fair market value measure of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.668" offset="1160056">The jury's verdicts were $723,000, a bit over $723,000 for a substitute facilities measure, and $225,000 for the fair market value measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.917" offset="1217003">The District Court then proceeded to enter judgment against the United States, but on the government's theory as to the amount of just compensation, the District Court held that in a case such as this where fair market value is ascertainable and it is found that a market exists for the property of the kind taken, that is the measure that is required to be employed under this Court's decisions; and furthermore, the District Court found that the Respondent had not ever carried its burden of presenting... had not in any event presented a prima facie case as to what a reasonable substitute facilities compensation award might be, the District Court observing that the only testimony proffered by Respondent pertained to the site they had actually acquired, a site that was three times as large as the site that was taken, and the District Court also observing that the testimony suggested that Respondent had paid in excess of fair market value for its substitute site.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.267" offset="1462449">The Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.400" offset="1470913">The Court of Appeals conceded that this case was, in their language, rather different from a typical substitute facilities case in that in this case fair market... there was no claim that fair market value was either unavailable or unworkable; nevertheless concluded that Respondent was entitled to have its compensation measured by reference to the cost of the substitute facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.544" offset="1563491">The Court of Appeals did attach a significant caveat, however, to that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.958" offset="1585121">It held that Respondent was not entitled to the benefit of the advantages that accrued from purchasing a larger site, and that on remand, the case was remanded for a new trial so that on remand the jury could be instructed to make an appropriate deduction from the substitute facility cost to wash out the windfall that might otherwise result from the fact that the Respondent had purchased a more, a larger and more capacious landfill site.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.470" offset="1711240">The government's position, as it has been throughout this case, is that the fair market value standard, which is ordinarily preferred in this Court's cases, is the proper measure of compensation for the taking of Respondent's landfill site.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.008" offset="1773411">In the final analysis, our submission is that what is lacking in the Court of Appeals rationale and in Respondent's argument is any explanation of what is... what is defective about the Preferred fair market value standard of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.472" offset="1851256">It does not seem to be controverted that the Court's decisions establish that the fair market value standard is the preferred mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.696" offset="1888141">The Court's cases make two essential points in support of that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.101" offset="1913741">The first is that market value assists, in an economy such as ours, measures what Justice Frankfurter called the external... has in it what Justice Frankfurter called the external validity of values that make it a fair measure of public obligation to compensate the loss incurred by a property owner as a result of the taking of his property for public use.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.087" offset="2009663">The point is that various individuals may have different use values for property, but if we are to have any common standard and a just compensation clause that says the government must pay someone for its property, there has to be a kind of lingua franca, a common standard of compensation, and Justice Frankfurter explained and the Court has quite uniformly held that fair market value provides that objective standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1357.064" offset="5569630">It said one way you might do it is the way the Second Circuit suggested in a case called Certain Property in the Borough of Manhattan, which requires a quite mechanical discounting for the added lifetime, and the government obviously would be far better protected under that system than it would be under the instruction given here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.127" offset="5645803">And yet the Court of Appeals explicitly declined to require that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.259" offset="5658342">And that obviously gives us unease.</text>

            <text syncTime="1396.871" offset="5728768">The Court of Appeals said yes, it may be that the price paid for a substitute facility was unreasonable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.665" offset="5756040">That is a question for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.708" offset="5764190">The question is how is the jury to decide that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.369" offset="5774848">We would submit the only way a jury can know whether a price is reasonable is to lock at the fair market value of a substitute facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.333" offset="5806717">But that entails a new item of complication, that is, to present comparable sales as to the new facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.346" offset="5830750">And that in fact happened in this case, a point which I regret not emphasizing in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.321" offset="5850603">The government's appraisers went out and did two sets of appraisals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.164" offset="5861992">They appraised comparable sales to establish the value, the fair market value of the substitute site and found that what had been paid was grossly in excess of fair market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.480" offset="5907236">But if you are going to make that adjustment and you are going to make the other adjustment, it seems to me that there are essentially two possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.485" offset="5931269">Either it will be done rigorously and you will have gone all the way around the barn and ended up back where you started out, or else somewhere along the line some prejudice to the government will have crept in because it wasn't done rigorously, because the jury was dazzled by some large numbers that were brought out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.146" offset="6001904">Those things suggest to us that there is no reason to change what the Court has called a clear, easily administrable rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.871" offset="6040774">No suggestion... there has been no showing here that the kind of manifest injustice that the Court has suggested might be relevant actually arose here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.047" offset="6077555">The kinds of reasons that have typically been suggested as to why there might be unjustice seem to us insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.234" offset="6114231">If you pay an unreasonable price for a substitute site, it is not unjust that the condemnee bear that price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.911" offset="6144951">If you take a much larger, more valuable substitute site, it seems to us not unjust that the condemnee should, which has the benefit of what it bought with that extra cost, should bear that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2145.061" offset="8721565">You know, you don't want a landfill a hundred miles away where the garbage trucks have got to go a hundred miles every day.</text>

            <text syncTime="2158.502" offset="8775377">Then we made the application to the state for a permit on this.</text>

Borough of Manhattan cited in the brief, you will find a rule of law that I would say is the proper rule of law and one to be considered and adopted by this Court, since you have not ruled on it in the past, and it is this:</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.756" offset="13848356">One, the substitute facility doctrine has been developed to meet the unique needs of public condemnees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.679" offset="13872076">In addition to citing numerous cases, this Court also cites cases where school grounds, playgrounds, parking lots in other jurisdictions, the Second Circuit particularly, have approved the substitute facility as the measure of damages there, even if there was a market value of the property being condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.964" offset="13957235">Simply stated, this rule assures that sufficient damages will be awarded to finance the replacement of the condemned facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.489" offset="13983253">The substitute facility... and this is your language... is not an exception carved out of the market value test, it is an alternative method available in public condemnation proceedings, alternative method available in public condemnation proceedings, citing other cases from the Second and Ninth Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.962" offset="14057232">Where circumstances warrant, it is another arrow in the trier's bow when confronted with the issue of just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.337" offset="14086698">When public condemnee proves that there is a duty to replace a condemned facility, it is entitled to the cost of constructing a functionally equivalent substitute, the cost of constructing a functionally equivalent substitute, whether the cost be more or less than the market value of the facility taken, more or less.</text>

            <text syncTime="3607.669" offset="14572053">Justice White, the cross-petition that was filed in this case, I just want to remind the Court, concerned a procedural question about the plain error rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3635.900" offset="14684902">Justice O'Connor, you mentioned a point which we think significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.462" offset="14707158">The public condemnee is better off than a private condemnee in one respect; it, too, has the power of condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.156" offset="14729937">With respect to Respondent's claim that there was no other property that could be taken, we think the record suggests that that claim be judged skeptically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.254" offset="14770374">One of the government's comparable sales in this case was the site which Respondent used on an interim basis for the two years prior to the acquisition of the Ellis County site.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.700" offset="14820112">That site not only could have been condemned, but in fact did trade hands in the private market during the two year period that Respondent was using it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.755" offset="14856369">That's one of the comparable sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.448" offset="14863161">Comparable sales show that its value was about a quarter to... a quarter of that rate that Duncanville paid in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.283" offset="14902449">Finally... and these are only illustrations of the problems that crop up if you are to entertain a substitute facilities measure, Respondent suggested that the State of Texas required the removal of the pipe, gas pipeline in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.914" offset="14965039">At page 418 of the transcript, Mr. Nichols reading from the terms of the permit, the permit, said no waste disposal operation shall be accomplished within 30 feet of any petroleum products pipeline or within 20 feet of its corresponding easement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.754" offset="15032330">In this case, that meant a total of 50 feet on either side.</text>
