            <text syncTime="24.377" offset="228970">That complaint alleged that the City was using its monopoly power over sewage treatment services in the relevant geographic market to monopolize another product market, sewage collection and transportation services.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.635" offset="286021">Originally, other than the Sherman Act, other claims were made at the trial court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.241" offset="308382">The relief requested in the complaint was strictly injunctive relief; in other words, to stop the City from engaging in this anticompetitive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.657" offset="350074">At the trial court level, the City, pursuant to rule 12(b)(6) moved to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.031" offset="371599">That motion was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.190" offset="380167">As to the antitrust claims, it was granted on Parker v. Brown exemption grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.325" offset="400751">Only the antitrust claim was appealed to the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.297" offset="416634">The Seventh Circuit affirmed again on Parker v. Brown exemption grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.472" offset="437323">There are three issues that are presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.083" offset="451742">The threshold issue is what showing is sufficient to establish that the sovereign State has clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed the State policy that the competition in question be displaced with monopoly service or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.285" offset="516526">If that requisite State policy is determined to exist, the next issue is what showing is sufficient to establish the State selected the City to implement that State policy with the particular anticompetitive conduct in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.844" offset="582772">If these first two tests are met, the next question is whether active State supervision is necessary to assure the City's anticompetitive conduct is attributable to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.972" offset="631360">The parties disagree on the showings under all three issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.666" offset="654139">However, the disagreement is fundamental and, I believe, determinative as to the first issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.031" offset="679530">The Town's position that the requirement that the State clearly articulate and affirmatively express its policy decision to displace competition means just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.757" offset="726446">It means, number one, that the evidence of that policy must be gleaned from the State's statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.834" offset="754763">It means, number two, that these statutes must clearly evidence that the State has addressed the displacement of competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="264.126" offset="1187977">Well, I think it is very unlikely that the State court would ever address the issue of the displacement of competition and replacing it with monopoly service or regulation other than in an antitrust situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.015" offset="1247537">I think also in this case, for example, although the Wisconsin Supreme Court addressed this type of conduct, it is clear from the decision in Chippewa Falls case that the Supreme Court, number one, expressly said we are not applying the Parker test.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.557" offset="1317649">The Wisconsin Supreme Court also had its own rule, that although not as stringent as the Parker test, approached it.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.772" offset="1350563">The Wisconsin Supreme Court said we are not applying that test either.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.494" offset="1365401">When you look at the Wisconsin Supreme Court's decision, what they said was, relying on Home Rule power, not completely, almost completely, this conduct is not prohibited by State law; this conduct is not prohibited by Wisconsin's mini-Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.856" offset="1438857">We submit that that is the same as in Boulder; that that is State neutrality; that the State court, the State law does not have to prohibit the anticompetitive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.895" offset="1483057">This Court has decided that the federal antitrust laws apply to municipalities and the federal antitrust laws prohibit anticompetitive conduct of these municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.970" offset="1527360">So I guess if the State court hit and applied the exact test by this Court, this Court would not be bound by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.878" offset="1566962">But on the other hand, I would not say that the Court should totally disregard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.420" offset="1581068">I think the Court has to make its own decision, based on its own tests, and what the legislature has said and what the legislature has intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.677" offset="1618162">So I think the statute must, number one, evidence that the State legislature has clearly addressed the displacement of competition, and then, two, under the test has clearly articulated its policy decision... that is, the State's... to displace that competition with monopoly service or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.440" offset="1693185">After outlining the facts of the case, the thrust of our argument will simply be this: that the clear articulation test is the correct test; that it serves the purpose and goal of protecting State sovereignty that the Parker exemption was intended for; that in this case this test has not been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.642" offset="1778031">It has not been met because the State of Wisconsin has not addressed the displacement of the competition defined in our complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.860" offset="1810841">It has not expressly articulated its policy decision to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.302" offset="1832679">In this case, the City of Eau Claire made the policy decision to displace competition, and then implemented their own policy decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.707" offset="1866221">This is not exempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="994.367" offset="4108885">We would have to prove that, just like electric municipal electric services, there is a price here.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.619" offset="4129888">In other words, unlike police and fire, when you get sewage service, that service is measured and you are charged a price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.194" offset="4164160">Number two, it requires that the City have monopoly power in one market, here sewage treatment, extending beyond its city limits into the unincorporated areas of the Towns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.770" offset="4206479">The reason that exists is because there are, number one, regulatory barriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.875" offset="4226959">This is a regional facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.616" offset="4233855">Due to environmental impact, that facility is the only one that can treat the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.948" offset="4251200">There are also economic barriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.991" offset="4259350">The costs, the investment costs of building such a facility are prohibitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.953" offset="4279203">So they have this monopoly that they have acquired with federal funds and now are saying we will not let you buy the service so you can compete with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.687" offset="4314208">So what they do is, if I am in the Town and I want sewage collection service, I have but one source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.422" offset="4337091">That is the City, because the City will not provide or sell to the Towns the treatment service so the Towns can compete with them in these unincorporated areas in the other market, the collection market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.591" offset="4389754">So our complaint, regardless of what the City says, is just the opposite of what the City says.</text>

            <text syncTime="1242.731" offset="5102374">Our position is simply this: that under the Wisconsin statutes... the remedy we seek is under the Wisconsin statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.806" offset="5130691">That statute provides for a contract between the City selling us these services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.718" offset="5150335">We would pay them a price for these services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.522" offset="5165486">They already, because they have a monopoly, have the capacity to serve this whole region.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.813" offset="5182727">We would put the pipe in the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.154" offset="5192026">The City would not do anything in the Towns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.117" offset="5199863">We would run our pipe and abut it into the City's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.339" offset="5212820">They would measure the flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.468" offset="5217313">We would pay them the cost of transporting the sewage through the pipe to the treatment facility, and we would pay them a fair price for treating that sewage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.364" offset="5252839">We are basically buying a wholesale service so we can retail that service to the users in the Towns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.351" offset="5284813">What we're saying is we just want the opportunity to compete with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.022" offset="5303517">We want the opportunity to offer to people sewage collection services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.715" offset="5322325">We think we can do it cheaper; we think we can do it better; but you're stopping us by your anticompetitive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.100" offset="5347821">You're stopping us by refusing to give us sewage treatment services that we must have to get into this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.826" offset="5378750">So our position is no, this is not an annexation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.058" offset="5395677">This is not a political case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.021" offset="5403514">If we are to go to court, we will have to prove that this is commerce; that there is monopoly power; that there are two separate products; that there is competition; that this competition is being restrained by the City anticompetitive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.108" offset="5463909">The relief we are seeking does not address annexation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.741" offset="5478433">The relief we are seeking does not address police or fire service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.326" offset="5496719">It simply addresses the right to buy at a fair and reasonable price sewage treatment services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.669" offset="5526080">And I think that brings us back to the question, and that question is: Can the Court select two unrelated statutes and ignore the rest of the statutes in the statute books and determine that there is a clearly articulated policy when there is none?</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.371" offset="5596924">The Wisconsin statutes form the basis for this competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.625" offset="5613956">They say both the City and the Towns may provide service in this unincorporated territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.448" offset="5637257">So the very basis for this competition is created by the Wisconsin statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.830" offset="5654707">There is nothing, we submit, in the decision or in the statutes that indicate the State of Wisconsin ever decided that this competition should be displaced and that the City should provide monopoly service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.369" offset="5712908">And I think the best evidence of that is Judge Wisdom's opinion, and that's the reasonable and foreseeable test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.383" offset="5736941">If, in fact, the State of Wisconsin... there was evidence that the State of Wisconsin had affirmatively addressed the displacement of competition, the reasonable and foreseeable test would not be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.671" offset="5786155">Under the test, instead of determining from reading the statutes, that the State has addressed the issue, the Court assumes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.786" offset="5818547">If the Court assumes that the State has addressed it, that's not a test; that's an elimination of the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.722" offset="5846341">So the Seventh Circuit said we need to find no evidence that the State of Wisconsin has affirmatively addressed this displacement of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.019" offset="5883540">We're going to assume it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.451" offset="5889182">Now, they are assuming it, I presume, because the City has found a way to use its delegated power in an anticompetitive fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.725" offset="5930351">Now, the Court, on the other hand, must also assume that the State of Wisconsin contemplated that that conduct would be used in a pro-competitive fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.542" offset="5973610">And there's no question that this conduct that they have done, or this delegated authority can be used both pro-competitively and anti-competitively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.759" offset="6010495">But I think the point is, instead of finding evidence that the State really affirmatively addressed it, where they can look at the statutes and say yes, this State thought about this, they have assumed it without any statutory evidence that that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.370" offset="6072875">That assumes that every time the State delegates some authority, that they have in mind all the possible uses of that authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1587.818" offset="6482684">And I say that all that the Seventh Circuit said is, having assumed they thought about it without proof, we're going to infer that they condone it because they didn't prohibit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.045" offset="6519569">Now, from there they make the quantum leap that, because they condone it, they intended it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1612.025" offset="6579546">You can use this authority to compete or not to compete.</text>

            <text syncTime="1616.305" offset="6596683">So this isn't a case where the State of Wisconsin has displaced competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.759" offset="6614446">Instead, they have refused to make that decision and said to the Cities, you make that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.032" offset="6635553">And what we have here, under the delegated authority, the City of Eau Claire can engage in anticompetitive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.957" offset="6667213">The next City to it can use that same delegated authority in a pro-competitive fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.233" offset="6688320">So each City is free to make its own policy decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.344" offset="6704830">And that's the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.926" offset="6711099">Under the Seventh Circuit's test, we drop exemption from a policy decision made at the State level to a policy decision made at the municipal level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.392" offset="6744954">And the result of the Seventh Circuit's test is that municipal policy decisions to displace competition are exempt; whereas I believe, under this Court's rulings, it's only when the State has made that decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.370" offset="6920914">The ultimate question, I believe, that we have here is what standard will the Court and should the Court establish for immunity?</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.406" offset="6957068">So far we know, under City of Lafayette, that Home Rule authority, or that Cities are not automatically exempt by virtue of their governmental status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.384" offset="7004924">Boulder tells us that Home Rule authority is insufficient to confer immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.258" offset="7028434">I would suggest to the Court that there is an urgent need to clarify this entire area.</text>

            <text syncTime="2050.113" offset="8331840">I think the natural result of that, the logical conclusion is that Cities would have to be compelled by the legislature to take whatever action they are to take to become immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.041" offset="8383563">I don't read Lafayette and Boulder as saying that you have to require activity by a municipality for it to be immune or exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.218" offset="8428284">And I think that mere authorization of a municipal activity is sufficient and adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.234" offset="8456392">Merely because a municipality may have the option of acting pro-competitively or not at all does not necessarily mean that the City cannot deal with the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2104.910" offset="8551060">Well, the answer to that is that in Boulder, the legislature had not acted specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.264" offset="8580526">All that we dealt with there was a grant of Home Rule authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.238" offset="8600379">The issue there was whether a cable television moratorium was authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.602" offset="8621799">The Colorado Constitution said that municipalities have Home Rule authority to act in general areas of concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.238" offset="8656385">There was no specific addressing of the issue of cable television.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.969" offset="8675298">In that case, I think the Court was entitled, and logically so, to find that there was no specific grant of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.594" offset="8709780">There was no authorization, there was no contemplation, nor could there be said to be one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.728" offset="8726289">In this case, it's entirely different because the statutes that the Court has before you, the Wisconsin law, has addressed the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.106" offset="8767876">The legislature has adopted these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.436" offset="8781146">And they specifically address the conduct of the City which is in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.261" offset="8800477">Despite the Town's characterization of the matter at hand, I think the issue is simply, their position is based entirely upon the City's policy not to extend its utility services outside of its boundaries without annexation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.334" offset="8888771">I would submit that if we did not have such a policy, we would not be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.537" offset="8905594">So the Seventh Circuit test, we would submit, balances and accommodates both State sovereignty and the antitrust laws, and we submit that it should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.837" offset="8958779">We feel that it fulfills the Parker test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.710" offset="8974243">It accommodates State sovereignty in that it gives recognition and viability to the State laws that are adopted in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.276" offset="9008516">Now, again, the Colorado and Wisconsin situations are entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.404" offset="9065045">Under the Parker rationale, the rationale of that is to preserve State sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.950" offset="9099213">And this is preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.810" offset="9106632">The State action is immunized from antitrust exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.274" offset="9116559">The Town, however, I think, assumes that immunization is available only of activity which is compelled and not authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.868" offset="9154906">They are concerned only with State mandates and not authorizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.263" offset="9180506">Again, here, the State authorizes but does not compel the City to undertake its policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.447" offset="9213212">And I would suggest that it would be peculiar for a State to take an action mandating and directing a municipality to take an action in an area of special traditional activity such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.859" offset="9270890">If the City is prevented under the antitrust laws from fixing its limits of utility service, then we would suggest the state law authorizing this limitation is nullified and has a direct impact on the Parker v. Brown exemption and the theory underlying that exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.933" offset="9367125">I think as evidence of this is the Town's claim in their reply brief that the City can comply with the Sherman Act only by ignoring State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.780" offset="9406518">They say that we can avoid Sherman Act liability by agreeing to extend our utility services outside of our boundary or divesting ourselves of our utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.118" offset="9447896">This, of course, would nullify the State law authorizing the Cities to take this position, and I think indicates that it's contrary to Parker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.242" offset="9484363">The Seventh Circuit test, on the other hand, upholds this and recognizes this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.618" offset="9513933">Now, addressing the specific State statutes which have been mentioned, again the basis of the Town's claim is that the City has no authority to adopt the policy which it has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.490" offset="9585404">Again, we limit our sewer service to our boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.773" offset="9602541">We are not trying to monopolize anything in the Township.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.326" offset="9620722">We confine it to the boundaries alone, and we extend only upon annexation, in which case the area in question becomes a part of the City, and the City then serves it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2397.530" offset="9721554">And it also has to be approved by the majority of the owners of property or the electors in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.314" offset="9744647">The Town's complaint mainly is that the City has decided not to share its treatment service with them and therefore annexation results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.704" offset="9790204">And I think this is evident from the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.986" offset="9807341">We are here on a motion to dismiss, I understand, but the complaint, I think, in itself does concede this point, paragraph 14 of the complaint specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.292" offset="9852585">So we have the basic statute, &lt;sixty-six point oh six nine two c@l&gt; [= 66.069(2)(c)] which explicitly states that the City may fix the limits of its service to the City boundaries, and it goes further than that to say that it has no obligation to serve beyond this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.475" offset="9933355">This again is plain language, and it answers precisely the Town's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.479" offset="9957388">Also, as evidence of State authorization contemplation are 14407(1) and (1)(m).</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.110" offset="10003886">Under sub (1), the State, through its DNR, may direct the City to extend its utility service outside the boundaries to the adjacent Town.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.865" offset="10046936">Under (1)(m), if the City initiates annexation and the Town members refuse this annexation, then the DNR order is voided and the City has no obligation to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.666" offset="10122064">Both the District Court and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals viewed this as explicit authority for the City's policy and evidence of legislative contemplation and intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.536" offset="10169607">Under Boulder, the statement is made that a district judge should look at all evidence of contemplation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.297" offset="10192594">This is indeed evidence of contemplation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.589" offset="10205760">The Town of Hallie v. City of Chippewa Falls has been mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.484" offset="10225404">And again, although I will concur that this is not determinative here, because we are dealing with federal antitrust laws, it does provide further indication as to State contemplation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.463" offset="10281306">There, that case had the same fact situation as here, involved the same Township, the Town of Hallie; given a different City, but the same Township, and it was held that there was no liability under the State antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.142" offset="10340030">The Towns nevertheless take issue with that case, saying there really was no finding that Wisconsin expressed any policy that competition be displaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.798" offset="10382661">But the case did say things like a sewer monopoly was more appropriate than competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.883" offset="10407008">They held that annexation is a reasonable quid pro quo to extending service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.847" offset="10430831">They found that the legislature intended that sewer service may be tied to other City services, and they found that the legislature did not intend that the City be required to extend sewer service extra-territorially.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.587" offset="10489763">As Justice Powell said in the Midcal case, respectful consideration and great weight must be given to the views of the State courts on matters of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.263" offset="10528529">We submit that the Chippewa Falls case adds a great deal of interpretation and fleshes out the statutes that are already in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.049" offset="10571579">The Town's argument goes further, to say that the State must approve a specific anticompetitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.845" offset="10606792">They say that the State law is neutral if the City has discretion to limit or not to limit its sewer service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.532" offset="10629571">In essence, their argument is that no matter what the legislature may have intended or contemplated, the State cannot confer discretion on its local governments in these areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.937" offset="10679203">They say, and I think the logical conclusion of their argument is that the State must direct the anticompetitive conduct specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.893" offset="10715043">We submit that under this Court's precedence, that is error because the City of Layfayette and the City of Boulder have set a legislative contemplation standard for local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.432" offset="10765199">Those cases have held that you must look at the authority granted to a municipality to operate in a particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.863" offset="10818906">From that, you can glean legislative intention and contemplation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.912" offset="10835102">We submit that the statutes in existence here show this authorization to operate and to formulate the basis for the City's policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.380" offset="10880973">The Towns have said that they are really not asking for a compulsion or compelling standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.389" offset="10936980">However, I think their sole test that they put forth for this Court to adopt, the so-called "necessarily follows" test indicates that that is precisely what they are asking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.227" offset="10988389">This is not appropriate, we submit, because it's contrary to Lafayette and Boulder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.352" offset="11012839">They claim in their brief, in their initial brief, that the v. Watson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.221" offset="11068323">An examination of that shows that that is the only case that applies such a test, if indeed it did apply it in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.817" offset="11102701">The Towns would formulate the "necessarily follows" test to mean that the City's action must necessarily or automatically follow from the exercise of City discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.398" offset="11176993">There are cases after Parks v. Watson, however, that indicate the Ninth Circuit did not adopt and has not adopted any such test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.415" offset="11221088">The case of Golden State Transit followed Parks v. Watson, making no mention to the case of Parks v. Watson or the "necessarily follows" test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.524" offset="11261525">And a month ago, three recent cases were decided in the Ninth Circuit, again making no mention of Parks v. Watson or the "necessarily follows" test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.730" offset="11306351">And those three cases are Springs Ambulance v. Rancho Mirage; Hudson &amp; Associates v. Cielo Vista; and Catalina Cable Vision Associates v. City of Tucson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.786" offset="11350550">Interestingly enough, the Springs Ambulance and the Catalina Cable Vision cases specifically refer to the Town of Hallie decision in the Seventh Circuit and all apply a legislative contemplation test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.987" offset="11407393">We submit that a compulsion or direction test is inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.102" offset="11435814">First of all, it would nullify local autonomy; if the State has to direct a municipality, then local autonomy really goes out the window.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.699" offset="11478237">In addition, to require the State to direct its municipalities would be an intrusion upon the sovereign State, again contrary to Parker v. Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.699" offset="11538214">Furthermore, the State could not delegate discretion if it wished to do so under that particular test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.225" offset="11572278">And again, that's an infringement on State sovereignty, we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.645" offset="11585966">The Towns also claim that Cantor v. Detroit Edison should apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.783" offset="11626612">Again, trying to bring a case from the private sector into the public sector, again to require that the City's action be compelled and not merely authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.381" offset="11684918">However, the example here that we have before us is strictly public governmental activities in an area of traditional, basic governmental power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.731" offset="11742387">The Towns, nevertheless, claim that there really should be no difference between public activity and private activity and that the same standards should apply to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.128" offset="11779899">However, even the Towns acknowledge a distinction for the purpose of applying the active State supervision requirement of Midcal, and they do seem to acknowledge that there is a distinction between private and public activity for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.028" offset="11843533">In the remaining time, I would like to address the issue of active State supervision which was developed in Midcal and is claimed to have application here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.660" offset="11914064">The Seventh Circuit did not require active State supervision in order to gain exemption in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.056" offset="11947605">And this, I would submit, is consistent with the other circuit courts that have considered this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.308" offset="11968712">These are shown on pages 41 and 42 of the City's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.181" offset="11984177">The Seventh Circuit did not require this prong of... the second prong of Midcal here because it found it was unnecessary and unwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.107" offset="12027853">Again, even the Towns would relax this requirement where a local government is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.133" offset="12055961">First of all, it is unnecessary to have this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.727" offset="12078322">In Midcal where the requirement was enunciated, that involved a private price-fixing scheme involving private wine dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.913" offset="12119073">There was a need to have continued compliance with the initial grant of State authority in order to determine whether or not State action as opposed to private action was being authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.441" offset="12177169">Here, we have a totally different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.396" offset="12197022">We have a public local government which is a creature of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.929" offset="12211128">Indeed, in cases involving sewer utility services in Wisconsin, the State Supreme Court has characterized it that the City is actually acting as an arm of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.096" offset="12259821">The City in this context is always subject to State scrutiny and to State restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.382" offset="12292944">If the State sees something that should not be occurring, it can always step in and take action to stop that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.738" offset="12330351">This is not like a public business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.369" offset="12344875">More pointedly, a City involved in a traditional function such as we are here is not motivated by profit, unlike the wine merchants in the Midcal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.298" offset="12396598">The City engages in providing sewer service to provide a public needed service to its residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.534" offset="12425541">It is not motivated by trying to gain profit by doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.218" offset="12448320">Therefore, a pointed reexamination of municipal conduct is not necessary in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.291" offset="12476637">Furthermore, local governments are subject to inherent restraints and limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.214" offset="12500252">One general concept is that public powers can be exercised only for public purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.800" offset="12526583">This again distinguishes public and private conduct in a material fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.405" offset="12553019">To require active State supervision over municipalities would conflict with the ability of the State to delegate discretionary authority to its municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.934" offset="12603174">We would become, in effect, de facto State Agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.275" offset="12620519">This again is agreed to by the nine amici States who agree that the second prong of Midcal should not be applied to the municipalities, especially when the City is undertaking a traditional municipal function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.298" offset="12696588">So such a requirement is unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.531" offset="12709545">The Seventh Circuit also found that it was unwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.171" offset="12724069">It would require Federal Courts to determine not only whether supervision of municipal activity exists, but whether active State supervision exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.251" offset="12784464">This would require the Courts to involve themselves in considerable feats of interpretation which should not be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.759" offset="12826469">Furthermore, it would require the State to actively supervise all activities of a myriad of local governments, keeping in mind that we're not only dealing here with sewer service, but the impact of this case will have an effect on all types of municipal services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.641" offset="12898044">The State could either do that, supervise, or it could undertake the function by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.365" offset="12924898">The States are reluctant to do either, as evidenced again by the amicus briefs of the nine States, including Wisconsin I might add.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.382" offset="12964918">Finally, and I think most importantly, if active State supervision were required, this would result in the erosion, if not the outright discretion of local autonomy and delegated authority which has been historically enjoyed by municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.803" offset="13034612">Finally, in conclusion, I would submit that the only thing the City is guilty of here is following State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.891" offset="13074945">The State authorized the City to adopt the policy it has adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.263" offset="13096470">Despite the Town's contention, this is the basis of the action here, and we suggest that the City should be exempt from the antitrust laws for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.571" offset="13149760">We ask the Court to affirm the decision of the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.185" offset="13176196">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Claude J. Covelli</label>
            <text syncTime="3264.138" offset="13188003">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.659" offset="13198034">The word "local autonomy" kept coming up in the City's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.103" offset="13215798">The City is saying we want the autonomy to make anticompetitive decisions and implement them because we are creatures of the State, free of the federal antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.340" offset="13268774">This issue was addressed in Lafayette.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.423" offset="13277133">This Court said Cities are not sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.815" offset="13294688">Cities, unlike States, are subject to the federal antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.328" offset="13316735">Their status does not elevate them above the federal antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.982" offset="13331363">I submit that the question is who decided to displace competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.064" offset="13351634">And when the statutes are looked at, it's clear the Seventh Circuit did not decide that the State of Wisconsin decided to displace this competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.663" offset="13394057">In fact, the Town's position was that was the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.674" offset="13406074">The Seventh Circuit said no, that is not the issue; the issue is not whether the State of Wisconsin decided to displace this competition with monopoly service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.340" offset="13448810">Instead, we're going to look at whether they delegated some authority, which the City then could make its own policy decision to use in an anticompetitive fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.367" offset="13484859">This case flies in the face of the Boulder decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.108" offset="13495830">In Boulder, this Court assumed that the City of Boulder was authorized by the State to regulate cable TV under its Home Rule powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.564" offset="13537731">Now, does it make any difference if the State would have listed in its Home Rule powers that cable TV is one of the things listed?</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.979" offset="13563331">But in Boulder, the Court said no; the State is neutral, because the State didn't say use that power to displace competition with monopoly service or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.515" offset="13609515">All it said is--</text>

            <text syncTime="3371.027" offset="13615576">Well, what if in listing the powers it had said a Home Rule City may, if it wants to... but it doesn't have to... monopolize sewer services?</text>

            <text syncTime="3396.464" offset="13717244">In Parker v. Brown, it was stated a State does not give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it or declaring that their action is lawful.</text>
