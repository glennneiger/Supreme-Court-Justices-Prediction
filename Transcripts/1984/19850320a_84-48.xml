            <label>Mr. David A. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="9.856" offset="185430">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in this case the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit awarded respondent a new trial on the ground that the government had not disclosed to respondent certain documents in its files that respondent claims he could have used to impeach two government witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.141" offset="310504">The issue concerns the standard of materiality that should be applied in determining whether such evidence is significant enough to require a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.449" offset="355748">The respondent in this case was indicated in 1977 on multiple counts of violating federal narcotics and firearms statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.073" offset="402246">Before trial, respondent served on the government eleven broadly worded discovery requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.096" offset="438399">Among those requests was the one that has now become the focus of the case, a request for any deals, promises, or inducements made to prospective government witnesses in exchange for their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.808" offset="501198">In response to all the various discovery requests, the government gave the defense a large number of documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.664" offset="540590">Now, respondent elected to waive a jury trial, and he was tried by District Judge Vorhees of the Western District of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.619" offset="572460">Among the witnesses against him were two state law enforcement officers named O'Connor and Mitchell, who had witnessed criminal transactions involving respondent while they were operating in an undercover capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.112" offset="630452">O'Connor and Mitchell were supervised during the investigation of respondent by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, ATF.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.282" offset="663157">At trial, O'Connor and Mitchell testified primarily about the firearms charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.270" offset="687085">Now, after the seven-day trial, Judge Vorhees found respondent not guilty on the firearms charges, but guilty on the narcotics charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.977" offset="725851">Some years later, respondent filed a Freedom of Information Act request, and he uncovered two form ATF contracts that had been signed by O'Connor and Mitchell before the trial, but that were not among the materials delivered by the government to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.355" offset="803382">Respondent then brought this action for collateral relief under 28 USC 2255, alleging that if he had known of these form contracts at the time of the trial he could have used them to impeach O'Connor and Mitchell.</text>

            <text syncTime="1571.034" offset="6430158">If it please the Court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the respondent's constitutional right to confront and cross examine his accusers was materially obstructed as a result of the government's failings in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.893" offset="6485537">As a result, at issue here is whether the Court of Appeals correctly reasoned that the non-disclosure in this case resulted in constitutional error and whether it applied the appropriate standard in reaching that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.135" offset="6542484">We obviously disagree with the petitioner's position that the Court of Appeals failed to consider the issue of materiality at all, and we take strenuous exception to its characterization of this sort of evidence that wasn't disclosed as non-constitutional, and its attempts to sort of trivialize its meaningfulness within the context of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.597" offset="6624404">And I think in order to resolve the case and to really, truly determine what the character of that evidence was in relation to your decision, we have to look to the facts, because there are several facts, as you have already discussed in your questions of counsel for the petitioner, which are especially relevant to this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.599" offset="6740388">I have represented Mr. Bagley on prior occasions, but I was not counsel in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.436" offset="6759719">The developments which occasioned this case occurred back in April and May of 1977, and during that time these two railroad employees were under the direct supervision of one single case agent in this case, a gentleman by the name of Mr. Norm Prins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.147" offset="6826592">Between April 12th and May 4th of 1977, the two of them executed four separate affidavits each, a total of eight affidavits, detailing their contacts with Mr. Bagley within the context of their investigation, and at the end of each one of those affidavits, the boilerplate paragraph indicated by counsel stated that they had received no rewards or promises of rewards in return for the statement that they had just made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.049" offset="6942158">On May 3rd, 1977, the day before each of these individuals signed in the presence of Mr. Prins, they executed the contract which is at issue here today, a contract which is labeled For the Purchase of Information and Payment of Lump Sum Therefore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.860" offset="7013420">On May 3rd they executed that contract, indicating an expectation, an objective expectation of return for their investigative efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.966" offset="7049887">On the following day, they executed again affidavits indicating that they had not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.436" offset="7071725">Mr. Prins supervised and observed both of these signings one day apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.757" offset="7093041">Pretrial, as indicated, Mr. Lundine, who was representing Mr. Bagley, filed a comprehensive Brady... or a comprehensive discovery motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.099" offset="7146331">It is important to note that this pretrial request came in November of 1977, a year after the Agurs decision, which required some sort of specificity if we are going to have the complaint that we do here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.491" offset="7195964">Within that pretrial discovery request, Mr. Lundine requested, as indicated, any promises or expectation... promises or inducements made to witnesses in exchange for testimony, but that is not all, and we don't rely upon that solely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.703" offset="7264822">As we indicated in our brief, the request was comprehensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.004" offset="7277988">It goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.587" offset="7280287">If I could, and it is in the record, of course, Mr.... pursuant to Brady in a subsequent paragraph Mr. Lundine requested</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.574" offset="7308290">"notice and copies of all material in possession of the government which is exculpatory, which may be favorable to the defendants or would assist in the preparation of the defense, including promises or representations of any kind made to government witnesses. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.072" offset="7386239">And finally, he stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.424" offset="7395644">"I would also request any information which goes to the reliability of the two government witnesses in this case that are the subject of this inquiry as it relates to the search warrant. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.130" offset="7438484">So, there were three separate recitals in that discovery motion requesting information about any sorts of inducements or representations or promises which may have been made to the witnesses in this case which may in effect taint their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.241" offset="7498984">In that same month, on November 30th, the government responded to that request and indicated in their discovery response that all statements made by these two witnesses had been turned over to the defense, including the affidavits which are at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.553" offset="7572231">It is interesting to note that in that response government counsel represented that these were the two principal government witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.474" offset="7607862">Missing, of course, was the contract to purchase and pay for information provided in return for their services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.545" offset="7640150">We submit that Agent Prins, who failed to disclose that document, however, didn't forget about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.132" offset="7662510">Trial commenced in mid-December, from December 12th until December 23rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.770" offset="7685080">On December 21st, before the trial was even over, Agent Prins went to his supervisor with the contracts in question and requested payment to each of these individuals, $500, in return, as he stated in his documents, which are before the Court, for their investigative efforts and for their testimony at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.866" offset="7769404">During trial Agent Prins did this, despite having turned over nothing with regard to those representations to counsel for the accused.</text>

            <text syncTime="2426.537" offset="9852094">But that isn't the issue here, and that is why Judge Vorhees's analysis was incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.940" offset="9873724">He did not perceive the constitutional significance of analyzing impeachment material pretrial to determine what strategy the case may take.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.498" offset="9915937">Judge Vorhees did not have the benefit of this Court's decisions in Strickland and Cronic, which came more recently outlining what effective counsel really is, and Justice O'Connor in her decision said, what we are looking to within the Sixth Amendment context is whether we can have justifiable reliance upon the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.976" offset="9989916">And what that means in Justice Stevens's opinion in Cronic was, a lawyer who is going to truly test the adversarial process of the trial court proceeding, and the way that you do that is through cross-examination, of course, and Justice Stevens then alluded to the Davis decision, which indicates that this type of information, the ability to cross-examine a government witness with impeaching information, is of the most important kind of information when analyzing that effective cross examination question, and that failure to disclose it or to provide it or to limit is constitutional error of the first magnitude, and that is what we are dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.787" offset="10149159">We never got to the point where we could involve ourselves in that very necessary constitutional right to effective cross examination of these witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.291" offset="10183118">Entire trial strategies were affected, and as Justice O'Connor said in her opinion in Strickland, ineffectiveness, or the effectiveness of counsel includes the ability of counsel to make independent decisions about how to conduct a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.585" offset="10244349">We had a jury waiver in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.585" offset="10252290">We had no cross examination of the key government witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.954" offset="10265769">We don't know what would have happened, and Clancy and Goldberg and your other teachings suggest we should not speculate as to what might have happened, but rather we look at the character of the evidence which was withheld, determined whether it was in fact of such magnitude that it impacted the constitutional rights of the defendants, and if it does, then you are going to reverse under the harmless error doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.386" offset="10351555">And if there is government interference in that process, actual government obstruction, then it is presumptive error, and we submit, and the Court of Appeals found in this case that the government's failure to disclose and their affirmations that these witnesses had had no promises concerning rewards, it was tantamount to government interference with the ability of counsel to conduct his defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2582.405" offset="10475585">Your Honor, as we indicated in our brief, that holding is effectively dicta, and I don't believe I am any happier with it than the Solicitor General is.</text>

            <text syncTime="2594.647" offset="10524590">But the effect of that language, of course, has to be dealt with, but what you look to in the decision is whether in fact the Court of Appeals analyzed the materiality, and of course the Court of Appeals in reaching its decision alluded to Brady, to Agurs, the standard set forth in Agurs, and to Davis, and the Court of Appeals then said, looking at Brady, the mandate of disclosure, and looking at Agurs, which says a failure will seldom, if ever, be excusable where there is a specific request, and this is a specific request case, and if it impacts a cross examination right, such as in Davis, then we are going to talk about reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.336" offset="10675369">I think that the decision needs clarity, and that, of course, is the function of you at this point, is to add some clarity to the Court of Appeals' opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2652.666" offset="10756662">I think what is necessary is to say that the language is improvident within the context of this decision, and that in looking at Giglio, there is a requirement of materiality in non-disclosure cases, but in this case there was materiality, so the result of the Court of Appeals was correct, but this does not mean that there is an automatic reversal rule that each case has to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, and that instruction should be sent forward to the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.419" offset="10871706">To summarize, the constitutional basis for our argument is, the government here did fail to disclose information as mandated by Brady.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.660" offset="10920607">The failure was to a specific request, and under Agurs, those sorts of failures are seldom, if ever, excusable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.814" offset="10945266">When looking at the character of the evidence, as urged in the Agurs decision, we find that it involved impeaching information of critical importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.836" offset="10981315">To answer your question, Justice Rehnquist, it is our opinion that Giglio did decide that impeaching information fell within the purview of Brady, that is, that it is favorable information, that is information that must be presented to the accused within the mandate of Brady.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.448" offset="11051741">And of course Davis, Napue, Giglio, and Brady all talked about the importance of impeaching information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.952" offset="11077759">The character of that evidence is manifestly important to the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.172" offset="11094687">We look to the counsel's effective assistance through cross examination as mandated by Davis, Strickland, and Cronic, and we find that there was no cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.628" offset="11132512">In fact, the trial court found that there was no cross examination in this case, and that is apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.599" offset="11152365">We rely upon the statements of the government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.984" offset="11169919">And that brings us to the practicalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.253" offset="11179010">We are dealing in the federal criminal discovery process, and as indicated in Agurs, it is not perfect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.157" offset="11202625">There is not full disclosure, and we are going to have problems like this from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.209" offset="11218821">Defense counsel in these situations is singularly reliant upon the forthrightness of the prosecutor in responding to government... or to discovery requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.266" offset="11267095">We have no capability to look into their file.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.051" offset="11278171">Here, where we ask for promises of reward or remuneration for any kinds of representations or inducements made to any witnesses, anything which might shed light on his reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.442" offset="11319758">Then I agree that the prosecutor was charged with going to his agent and saying, hey, have you promised this guy anything?</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.080" offset="11346298">Is there anything that we have got to let the defense counsel know which may impact the credibility of the witnesses in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.186" offset="11378690">Well, the response to that in our case was to produce affidavits which clearly suggested to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.022" offset="11402096">As a result, cross examination was limited effectively and materially, and the constitutional rights of this defendant, we submit, were impermissibly infringed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3548.944" offset="14341812">In Agurs, the Court specified a standard that would apply to no request or general request cases, and the Court said that a request for all Brady material or all helpful material would be a general request.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.418" offset="14391653">But the Court left open the possibility that a specific request would be judged by a different standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.089" offset="14418298">Now, I think what the response to that has been, and this case is an excellent example of it, is that defense counsel have tried to take the general request for all Brady material and break it down into a dozen or so abstract categories, all deals, promises, and inducements, all information casting doubt on the reliability of the witnesses, all statements.</text>
