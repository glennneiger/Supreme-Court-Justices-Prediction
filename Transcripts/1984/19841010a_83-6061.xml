            <label>Mr. Charles G. White</label>
            <text syncTime="13.220" offset="190886">Mr. Justice... Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.742" offset="208963">This is a case of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.184" offset="222651">The statute involved is found in Section 2114 of Title 18 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.830" offset="253266">It prescribes the robbery and attempted robbery of anyone in lawful custody or control of mail matter of any money or other property of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.410" offset="311572">The statute was amended or had been amended in 1935 to add in the words</text>
            <text syncTime="616.363" offset="2603451">"or any money or other property of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="54.347" offset="2603346">to what had previously been known exclusively as the Postal Robbery statute affecting only matters dealing with the Post Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.153" offset="2603242">The question before this Court is whether or not Congress intended to expand the scope of that statute to encompass any custodian of any money or government property that they would prosecute under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.744" offset="2603137">Now, the Government has, of course, adopted that position based on what they consider to be the plain reading and unambiguous wording of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.952" offset="2603033">Petitioners contend that in fact the statute is not unambiguous and that the... it suffers from various defects in the way that it's worded, and we will be in a position to argue that.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.892" offset="2602928">In addition, petitioners feel that the congressional intent is certainly relevant, and I would say controlling, as to what it was that Congress intended to do when in fact they amended the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.059" offset="2602824">Petitioners will also propose to this Court an alternative, what we believe is in fact the plain meaning of the statute that comports with congressional intent; and that is an... that will involve the application of an ancient rule, a well-respected rule of statutory construction called the rule of ejusdem generis.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.206" offset="2602719">Now, the facts in this case are not totally pertinent to the legal issue involved, but some of them should be gone into in order to... to give some background to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.104" offset="2602615">The petitioners were two brothers, Jose and Francisco Garcia, who back in July of 1981 were engaged in negotiations with an undercover agent from the United States Secret Service for the purpose of selling or buying counterfeit money.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.656" offset="2602510">Now, the... Francisco... the Garcia brothers represented to Agent Holmes that they would be in a position to sell him counterfeit money in exchange for real money.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.403" offset="2602406">They had a meeting in a park in Miami, Florida in the evening in which Agent Holmes had brought some government money which was kept in a pouch.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.792" offset="2602301">The negotiations apparently were not to be had, because Jose Garcia did pull out a gun and train it upon Agent Holmes, and Francisco Garcia climbed into the car that Agent Holmes had driven to the scene and escaped with, or tried to escape with the pouch containing the real money.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.154" offset="2602197">The backup agents that were with Agent Holmes were approaching the scene to affect arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.697" offset="2602092">One of their cars hit Francisco Garcia, knocking him to the ground, and Francisco Garcia was taken into custody, as was Jose Garcia.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.763" offset="2601988">Now, they were... these two individuals were prosecuted and tried in front of a jury in district court in the Southern District of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.911" offset="2601883">This issue that's before the Court was not raised by the trial attorney for the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.047" offset="2601779">The issue was not raised until the brief was filed with the Eleventh Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit permitted the issue to be argued and decided on its merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.303" offset="2601674">In the Eleventh Circuit opinion the conclusion was that the statute seemed very plain and unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.155" offset="2601570">Basically, the Government's position was adopted, and the petitioners were... had their convictions affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.932" offset="2601465">I had stated in the very beginning that I intended to show that the statute was in fact ambiguous, and I think that the way to understand it is to look at the way in which the Government is contending the statute should be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.784" offset="2601361">By looking at the words themselves you have a very unusual situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.837" offset="2601256">You have three clauses that are separated by a disjunctive "or".</text>
            <text syncTime="306.202" offset="2601152">The Government has argued that in fact there are two clauses separated by a disjunctive "or", and that one clause being mail matter, and then</text>
            <text syncTime="320.901" offset="2601047">thereby that... those... that phrase which was added by Congress in 1935 encompasses one category of things to be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.217" offset="2600943">And the Government presumes that the intention of Congress in reading that statute was to have "property of the United States",</text>
            <text syncTime="422.979" offset="2600838">"other property of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="341.234" offset="2600734">modify the preceding phrase which is "any money".</text>
            <text syncTime="346.059" offset="2600630">Well, in the same breath the Government contends, and the Eleventh Circuit seemed to accept this argument at the time, that the use of the disjunctive always establishes completely and wholly separate categories of crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.259" offset="2600525">In order to determine or to rule that the plain reading of this statute establishes that, you have to take away from mail matter the other parts that were added in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.339" offset="2600421">Otherwise, you may have, in fact, what the petitioners contend, which is a statute which was only designed to... to close what was perceived in 1935 to be a loophole in the Postal Robbery statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.808" offset="2600316">Now, how does this... how does this work?</text>
            <text syncTime="394.261" offset="2600212">If we take each different category that's separated by the disjunctive, we have mail matter is the first category, and there's no dispute as to what that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.055" offset="2600107">There's a long history of case law and a pedigree which goes all the way back to 1792 that regards this particular part of the statute, or "any money".</text>
            <text syncTime="415.683" offset="2600003">What was it that "any money" means?</text>
            <text syncTime="418.485" offset="2599898">Surely, if the category has to stand by itself, then</text>
            <text syncTime="424.870" offset="2599794">is not going to be used to modify "any money".</text>
            <text syncTime="428.333" offset="2599689">We don't have a situation here where the plain reading of the statute says that</text>
            <text syncTime="433.015" offset="2599585">"any money of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="435.158" offset="2599480">We also have a situation where it would have made "any money" a redundant statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.762" offset="2599376">As in Section 2112 of the United States Code in Title 18, robbery of government property has been ruled quite conclusively to include government money.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.178" offset="2599271">The only purpose that Congress could have had for putting "any money" as a separate clause was that they were contemplating that there would be other money over which Congress could assert jurisdiction that was not government property.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.058" offset="2599167">And I submit to the Court that what they were discussing and what they contemplated was the money which would be in the possession of those who would normally possess mail matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.935" offset="2599062">Material other than mail matter the statute was designed to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.289" offset="2598958">And there's another way when you look at the statute as a whole that this type of an argument and this type of ambiguity begins to make more and more sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.517" offset="2598853">Before we get to the articles which a lawful custodian would have custody of... the mail matter or any money or other property of the United States... we have the situation of a... who is a lawful custodian of these... these properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.009" offset="2598749">Again, this is a statute which has been around for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.084" offset="2598644">Case law has been established as to a lawful custodian of mail matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.756" offset="2598540">Lawful custodians... different courts have... have looked at the... at postal regulations, different courts have looked at private business people who run a post office on a contractual basis and ruled that those people are in... in custody of mail matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.558" offset="2598435">The courts have... have ruled on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.690" offset="2598331">Congress is presumed to have known what the precedents were when it added these... these other categories to mail matter or any money or other property of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.578" offset="2598226">They knew what a lawful custodian of these matters were, and there's no indication in the statute that they intended to set up any other standard for determining what it was that constituted a lawful custodian.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.868" offset="2598122">Now, the petitioners contend that these types of problems are all based... and really the reason why we are here before this Court is because the Government was able to convince the Eleventh Circuit, of course, that there was only two clauses with the "or".</text>
            <text syncTime="593.871" offset="2598017">But if you look at the opinion below, which we have petitioned this Court to review, you will see that there is a major glaring mistake that was made in that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.140" offset="2597913">And that is that the writer of that opinion presumed that there was a comma between the words "mail matter" and the clause</text>
            <text syncTime="619.636" offset="2616512">And, in fact, the United States Code does not contain a comma in that place.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.220" offset="2638873">There is no separation in the two categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.841" offset="2649322">The separation is into three categories under a plain meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.875" offset="2673459">Now, going back to the analysis of what kind of any money they were talking about and other government property, we now see that Congress must have intended when reading the statute in its plain and unambiguous fashion that somehow the various phrases would be related to each other; that the different categories that the Congress was intending to protect would be related to each other.</text>

            <text syncTime="1000.055" offset="4138197">All of what I've said before about the wording in attempting to answer the questions of the Court tries to get us past the threshold question which caused this case not to... I believe not to be fully considered by the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.900" offset="4209563">And that was to go right into the issue of what it was that Congress was intending to do in 1935 when they added those words</text>

            <text syncTime="1028.795" offset="4253136">There are certainly...

            <text syncTime="1044.096" offset="4314367">And I submit that the... the others the Government proposes are based more on what they would like the law to be rather than what it was that Congress intended the law to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.171" offset="4350625">Going back into the history of the 1935 amendment we see that there really wasn't the kind of comprehensive hearings, the kind of comprehensive input from other federal law enforcement agencies that one would assume would happen if the Government was actually planning on enacting a statute of the sweeping scope which the... the Government would have you believe they intended to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.857" offset="4457413">Really, the... the... a letter from the Postmaster General was the only... was the only part of the committee reports, aside from indications of various... various amendments that were being proposed on some phraseology changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.841" offset="4525332">That letter from the Postmaster General reflected his concern that the law of 2114, which at that time was found in Section 320 of Title 18, smack in the middle of all the postal offenses, that that was very good protection for those custodians of mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.932" offset="4609655">However, he was pointing out a rise in incidents of robberies of custodians of other materials besides mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.511" offset="4651973">Now, it was a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.401" offset="4659601">It wasn't drafted in such a way that it was going to... the way the letter was drafted was going to become law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.365" offset="4683425">The Government in their brief made some issue about the fact that he says</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.847" offset="4697322">"custodians of money or other property. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.650" offset="4712577">as opposed to saying mailman or letter carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.333" offset="4727310">Well, that makes a lot of sense that he would just use the term "custodians of money" when he's the Postmaster General and he's writing a letter to the Post Office Committee in the House of Representatives, and he's talking about concerns of his own which are for his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.551" offset="4788123">What he was concerned about... and the statement of Congressman Dobbins on the floor of the House of Representatives underscores this... what he was concerned about were people coming in and robbing post offices not of letters, not of mail matter, but of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.864" offset="4853430">And he wanted to make sure that the... a loophole, that this loophole in the statute was covered so that they could use the statute with its very stringent mandatory sentence if a firearm or dangerous weapon was used, they could use the statute to protect postal employees or those who have lawful custody of mail matter or other property that would be in the possession or control of the postal function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.221" offset="4966801">This is really what got this whole statute started, the whole amendment process started with this letter, with this request that this loophole be closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.239" offset="5006925">Now, Congressman Dobbins, as the Government points out, was never ordained a "floor manager", in quotation marks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.423" offset="5039630">Congressman Dobbins, however, if you turn to the Congressional Record and turn back a few pages from where the various quoted excerpts on this bill are, or move back... up a few pages, you'll see that Congressman Dobbins was from the Post Office Committee, and he was apparently in charge of shepherding quite a few bills cut of that committee through the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.828" offset="5125312">And he was the one that they would turn to when they wanted to ask a question or what does this mean; what does this bill really do; is this bill this or that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.535" offset="5164078">And he would answer the question because, as he told them, he was consulting with the lawyers, the attorneys that worked for the Postmaster General trying to construct the wording of a statute that would simply and easily close the loophole that he was concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.544" offset="5236176">There's another indication that the... that this is what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.493" offset="5271911">There was some discussion in the Government's brief to the effect that the... there was... just because there was silence on this issue from other law enforcement agencies, that does not necessarily mean that they weren't interested in the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.221" offset="5326873">Well, one year before, one year before this amendment was enacted, the Congress considered a letter from the Attorney General... I believe it was to the House or Senate Judiciary Committee... regarding the enactment of what later became Section 111 of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.065" offset="5410256">In that... in that letter, the Attorney General, of course, as the case... as this Court remembers from the United States v. Viola case where the congressional intent behind 111 was... was explored, the Attorney General mentioned that he was concerned, of course, about the jurisdiction of the federal courts over protecting law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.918" offset="5493638">He mentioned in the back... back part of the letter about how other people are trying to... other federal agencies are trying to protect their employees as well, and he mentioned specifically the Post Office is trying to protect assaults on letter carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.259" offset="5554974">So even the Attorney General at that time, and one year before this 1935 amendment, he got his extra protection for situations of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.247" offset="5598964">And as a matter of fact, both the petitioners were charged under... under Section 111 in addition to Section 2114, and Jose Garcia was convicted, and Francisco Garcia was acquitted of that count by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.986" offset="5649955">When one takes the entire context of this bill, of this amendments, looking at the ambiguity and the two different ways in which the statute can be read, it becomes clear that congressional intent would control under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.432" offset="5739712">Applying the rule of ejusdem generis to this particular situation would only be not justified, it would only be incorrect if in fact there was a manifest congressional intent to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.540" offset="5792166">And it's clear that there is no such intent, and the Government has the burden, I submit, of showing where it is that Congress intended that their scope behind the statute would control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.259" offset="5859039">Really, in conclusion, I would state that the Government has basically lucked out in the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.519" offset="5904074">The court apparently, and the Government, was willing to... to look and... and... and construe a comma which would give some credence to their plain reading, their plain and unambiguous version of what it was that they thought the statute meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.788" offset="5969067">Petitioners have contended from the beginning that this is an... this was an ambiguous statute, and that for the Government to construe it as suddenly that the... that the Congress intended to extend these protections to all lawful custodians of any money--</text>

            <text syncTime="2508.055" offset="10170184">It had been their... it had been my understanding of this case up until a week ago that there was no real dispute, but that on its face 2114 clearly covers the conduct here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.470" offset="10211875">And we take the position, as we do in our brief, that there's no need to go beyond the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.935" offset="10233714">It's not a case where the words are unclear, ambiguous or imprecise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.766" offset="10249074">And since there were not two plausible readings that were suggested, there was no reason to go any further to choose between any two... any such readings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.202" offset="10282719">Now, it wasn't until they filed their reply brief last week and in their argument today that they ever really suggested an ambiguity in 2114.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.008" offset="10313962">They've changed their tune, and they recently discovered an ambiguity which, as I understand it, is that the term "money" is unclear in that it could either refer to government funds, or it could refer to any money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.719" offset="10368819">And I submit, as I said in response to a question earlier, that it doesn't matter for purposes of this case, because what were stolen were government funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.653" offset="10408525">And in any event, the statute, in our view, does cover only government funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.219" offset="10430886">They also make this morning an argument under the doctrine of ejusdem generis, and we submit on that that the doctrine is inapplicable here and should be rejected for essentially the reasons that the Court rejected it in the Powell case that's cited in Petitioners reply brief and in the Turkette case, namely that it's an aid to construction that comes into play when there's some uncertainty in the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.418" offset="10539660">Here there is no uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.168" offset="10546661">Each category is separate, and there is no common characteristic that runs through the three categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.094" offset="10582292">In essence, we don't have a statute that has a long list of specific items followed by a catch-all phrase at the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.301" offset="10615206">In fact, the case on which they rely, the Stever case, my recollection of the statute in that case in 1916 was that the catch-all phrase at the end said something like "or other similar" items to the items that it pursued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.980" offset="10673929">We have nothing of that sort here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.241" offset="10682915">Now, as I said, there's no rule of law that prevents the Court from looking at the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.209" offset="10722830">Our position on that is that when you look at it and you take the legislative history as a whole, it supports us.</text>

            <text syncTime="2797.067" offset="11326259">First of all, one of the suggestions that Mr. Walcott made was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.329" offset="11343291">The reason that I... that I don't share that concern about the significance of Congressman Dobbins' comments is first of all that they have to be understood in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.915" offset="11377668">He was not offering an explanation of the scope of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.648" offset="11392505">He was not offering a definition of the terms that are at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.592" offset="11416329">He was responding to criticism of the bill on an altogether different subject, namely the mandatory nature of the 25-year sentence.</text>
