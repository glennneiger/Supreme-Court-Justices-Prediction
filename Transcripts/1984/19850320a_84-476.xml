            <text syncTime="1436.411" offset="5875090">The fourth point I'd like to make on that secrecy argument is that the Respondent, I think disingenuously suggests in his answering brief, that he did not have an ample opportunity to respond.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.286" offset="5926604">The record in this case is clear, as the deposition of Congressman Johnston makes clear, that the Respondent promptly received copies of both letters from Congressman Johnston, his friend, and Senator Helms, his friend and sponsor, and that on January 19th and February 27th he in fact wrote to Congressman Johnston with enclosures, providing a detailed response to every one of petitioner's allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.986" offset="6025451">So he did in fact have an ample opportunity to respond, and that's in the record of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1548.714" offset="6324292">No, I do not think it would, Your Honor, because the petitioner would still be subject to penalties for providing false information to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.637" offset="6356057">On the contrary, though, I think that a rule granting petitioner's immunity from common law libel actions would tend to encourage citizens to provide truthful and useful information to the government because they would no longer have to fear spending $20, $4O, $60, $80,000 in unrecoverable defense costs if their communication was simply alleged to be knowingly false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.620" offset="6463890">Let me respond to one point that has not yet come up, but is... since the Respondent really says virtually nothing at all about our historical argument that was known to the framers and nothing at all about our functional analysis argument, Respondent talks only about the petitions being secret and misdirected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.134" offset="6553961">The argument about misdirected is that petitioner's first letter was misdirected because he sent it to Congressman-Elect Johnston and to President-Elect Reagan before they had been sworn in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.524" offset="6599518">But as the record makes clear, in November of '80 the Respondent had applied for the position to Congressman-Elect Johnson and to Senator Helms requesting their assistance in obtaining the appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.999" offset="6645494">If it was appropriate for the Respondent to seek the assistance of Congressman-Elect Johnston in obtaining the appointment, it was no less appropriate for the petitioner to write to the same Congressman-Elect Johnson to oppose the appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.473" offset="6699306">It was widely reported in the press that there was a transition team in place, chaired by Ed Meese, that was then actively considering nominations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.663" offset="6732116">In fact, the Respondent alleges that he was an active candidate, and that the President would be making appointments as soon after he was sworn in as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.601" offset="6767851">There is no more appropriate occasion for a citizen to communicate with the Federal Government concerning a candidate for Federal office than when the decisionmaking process is actively underway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.992" offset="6813409">Let me conclude... and then I'd like to reserve a few minutes for rebuttal... by simply reminding the Court, as I'm sure it's aware, that the deterrent effect we are talking about here is an extraordinarily severe deterrent effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.710" offset="6920302">In fact, the Respondent concedes at page 18 of his brief that the potential cost of defending a libel action is great, to use the Respondent's words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.296" offset="6954679">And the relative cost for an ordinary citizen who does not have libel defense insurance is even greater than the cost for a media defendant, such as the New York Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.254" offset="6994490">Let me pose a hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.456" offset="7003267">If North Carolina tomorrow enacted a statute imposing a $20,000 tax on all petitions to the Federal Government, can anyone doubt that that would silence all petitions to the Federal Government by everyone but the most wealthy or foolhardy citizen?</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.049" offset="7065647">But the $20,000 tax, though it's not paid to the State of North Carolina, is the same in this case under the common law rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.738" offset="7100442">The petitioner must pay that $20,000 to his defense lawyers and to court reporters, not to the State of North Carolina directly, but the cost to him is the same and the deterrent effect on him is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.462" offset="7151329">If this Court does not grant absolute immunity, I think it is clear that the message that will go out to the citizens of this country is that they are no longer free to criticize candidates or to criticize wrongdoing by public officials, and that if they do so, they do so at enormous economic cost to themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1897.572" offset="7719753">In that case the Court set out the protection the Constitution makes available to citizens who criticize public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.527" offset="7751518">The citizens in question in New York Times were not petitioning the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1997.801" offset="8120681">Yesterday, this Court affirmed the position that's inescapable under the unified analysis of the speech and petition clauses received by this Court already, stating that while the petition and speech clauses are separate they are related and generally subject to the same analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.132" offset="8198003">Application of that same analysis is all that we ask, that malicious lies whispered in the ear of a government official receive no greater protection than malicious lies printed in The New York Times.</text>

            <text syncTime="2104.488" offset="8547417">The opportunity to respond that counsel for petitioner discussed existed to some extent under the facts of the case before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2132.324" offset="8658803">Presumably, had Mr. Smith in fact been appointed, that resolution would have occurred in the minds of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.613" offset="8699868">But in the absence of his appointment, for whatever reason, the malicious lies are left and he... and Mr. Smith has no opportunity to address them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.440" offset="8759218">The petitioner's argument, it seems to us, asks this Court to address the question of the petition clause as if there had been no development of constitutional libel law since the drafting of the first amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.603" offset="8835913">He appears to present a blank slate, or a blank slate for the last 200 years, to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.590" offset="8863812">But we would submit that this case not only deals with the petition clause, but also the balancing between the effect of immunities granted under the petition clause and the protections granted under the speech clause, because it is as citizens see those protections that they will decide where discussion of matters of public interest will take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.959" offset="8985334">The First Amendment fundamentally supports the proposition of public, vigorous, wide-open debate of issues important to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.917" offset="9029115">This Court has said that many times, and as recently as Monday of this week.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.988" offset="9049386">It is our position that providing one who would use malicious lies for political gain with an absolute immunity would not only encourage the false information flowing to the Federal Government, but would encourage the discussion of it to be moved out of any guarantee of rebuttal by those not only who were defamed by it, but by those who disagree with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.559" offset="9179685">The discussion of the matters of public interest would be moved into the secrets of private letters and whispered petitions to government officials, carefully chosen so that they are the person most... best in a position to do the most harm to the man who's being defamed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.538" offset="9263590">That approach to the questions presented by the petitioner's argument, we believe necessarily draws one back to the protections provided by New York Times and the fundamental precepts of the Constitution supporting and encouraging open... wide-open, robust debate of public issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.058" offset="9381663">We would submit, further, that while the petitioner discusses in his brief at some length the chilling effect of a potential large libel verdict, that since New York Times there has not been a single libel verdict for more than a half million dollars or as much as a half million dollars affirmed by an appellate court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2420.427" offset="9811117">And in New York Times, the chilling prospect was considered, it was weighed, and it was determined that under the speech clause and the press clause, that question was adequately addressed by the malicious falsehood standard: knowingly false, reckless disregard of the truth or falsity thereof.</text>

            <text syncTime="2762.998" offset="11181500">Rather, he presented them as true and he, as the briefs point out and it's clear from the letters, cites page and verse, name, address, telephone numbers of people that the federal official was told could substantiate these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.476" offset="11259345">And those people are the very witnesses that we intend to call at trial, are the people through whom we intend to prove the falsity and the maliciousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.617" offset="11303962">But the fact of presenting those names and addresses wins this air that's repeated by citation to those in petitioner's brief of credibility that is very difficult to overcome in a process like this one, where any number of candidates for an office exist, any number of whom have good appropriate qualifications, and as to one of whom this mess is presented, this series of allegations, this possible problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.177" offset="11466130">And the effect of that is potentially devastating to a candidate who would be considered equally among others, and could do away with any possibility or any perceived need for checking the reliability and the truth or falsity by the federal official who had available to him other qualified reasonable candidates to choose among.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.148" offset="11594026">The potential of the FBI doing an investigation that counsel for petitioner discussed clearly existed, except that there is no way to know if the FBI chose to or not, and even if it had, the allegations of that process would not necessarily result in Mr. Smith having an opportunity to present his side of the story.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.517" offset="11719518">In fact, that argument, it seems to me, raises the government's investigatory process to a... it puts it on a higher plane than the truth-seeking processes of the courts in which Mr. Smith seeks to have this question determined, to have the fact of the falsity of the information and the malicious nature of its presentation proven.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce James Ennis, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3159.823" offset="12768700">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.675" offset="12780194">The respondent raised the point about public debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.793" offset="12792628">First, there is no allegation in the complaint that my client, the petitioner, distributed copies of this letter to any member of the public, only to federal officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.649" offset="12828050">There was a very good reason why he did not distribute his letter to the public and give an opportunity for public debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.985" offset="12857412">He was seeking to exercise his right to petition the Federal Government concerning a decision that was about to be made by the Federal Government, and there was no arguable basis to believe that the public would be able to redress that particular grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.495" offset="12919479">Second, by limiting his petition to officials of the Federal Government, he obviously limited any damage to the reputational interest that the candidate might have in his local home community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.120" offset="12961902">And while I'm on that point, let me simply state that this Court's decisions in Gertz and Monitor and Hutchinson make clear that although reputation is an important interest, the reputational interest of a candidate for office is greatly diminished because candidates invite scrutiny of their qualifications and reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.783" offset="13040583">Second, Justice O'Connor asked whether or not a rule of good faith or qualified immunity would be important and might not be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.822" offset="13084782">Let me simply refer to the position taken by the United States in Webg v. Fury which is quoted at page 40 of our brief, in which the United States said:</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.511" offset="13115502">"To allow a plaintiff to simply plead bad faith would create a chilling effect on the exercise of the right to petition. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.451" offset="13151237">The United States continued that the right to petition would</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.219" offset="13162313">"lose any real meaning because private citizens will be deterred by the threat of litigation from exercising that right which would deprive the Federal Government of the information it needs to govern. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.062" offset="13217693">Let me conclude by simply stating once again that we are not seeking absolute immunity from every possible sanction for every communication that could conceivably be deemed a petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.886" offset="13268997">We only seek immunity from common law libel actions and only in the three circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.540" offset="13295642">First, the petition was from a citizen to appropriate officials of the Federal Government; second, the petition was relevant to the qualifications of a candidate actively seeking appointment to federal office; and third, the petition was made on an appropriate occasion while the federal decision concerning appointment was still pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.037" offset="13377562">Thank you very much.</text>
