            <label>Mr. Irving Bizar</label>
            <text syncTime="59.639" offset="372462">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court; the issue in this case is whether the statutory language enacted by the Congress for section 14(e) in the Williams Act is to be given a different construction in the plain meaning of the words used.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.183" offset="442575">14(e)... and I shall paraphrase that briefly for Your Honor... provides three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.237" offset="470787">The first part prohibits misrepresentations or omissions to state facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.724" offset="492730">The second part, preceded by the disjunctive "or", prohibits the making of any fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative acts or practices in connection with a tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.116" offset="542363">And the third part directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate regulations to prevent fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative acts or practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.673" offset="584576">The courts below held, although the Third Circuit criticized this finding and my brothers argue here, that misrepresentation is required for any violation of section 14(e), and they found none below.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.385" offset="655421">The facts upon which this case arises are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.087" offset="670258">They're based upon a complaint, and a complaint which was subject to a 12(b)(6) motion, on which no evidence was considered, and, as Your Honors know, a 12(b)(6) motion assumes the truth of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.977" offset="721772">And those facts are, briefly, these: Burlington Northern, after acquiring a block of El Paso stock, made a tender offer for 51 percent of the El Paso stock outstanding, or approximately 25-odd million shares, at $24 a share.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.254" offset="782898">They did this on December 20, 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.491" offset="803796">December 30, 1982, they have received the 51 percent they had tendered for.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.466" offset="847682">El Paso management, anxious to defeat this tender offer, first issued some preferred stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.304" offset="879029">Burlington Northern attacked that issuance in the Delaware Chancery Court, and was on the very eve of receiving a victory in that court, the Chancellor having announced that that issue would be held illegal and was calling the parties in to consider what further remedies were to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.616" offset="956351">I might add that the tender offer which had originally been promulgated by Burlington Northern had a number of outs.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.770" offset="980906">The complaint alleges that those outs were inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.424" offset="1003581">Thereafter, on... faced with defeat, the El Paso management met with Burlington Northern and arranged a new deal.</text>

            <text syncTime="634.423" offset="2671551">Let me come back to the first part, if I may, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.843" offset="2693181">We say that definitions given for 10(b) considerations are not necessarily the same definitions to be given in 14(e).</text>

            <text syncTime="665.626" offset="2796416">Now why should it be that there should be a different consideration for 10(b) than 14(e)?</text>
            <text syncTime="671.213" offset="2818673">We say that for 10(b) the Congress and the courts are concerned with the integrity of a purchase and a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.052" offset="2850020">They want to ensure that the trading market is above-board in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.139" offset="2870395">14(e) does not concern itself with trading markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.074" offset="2886173">What 14(e) is concerned with, and this is frequently lost sight of, is the right of the target company shareholder to be able to make his choice as to whether or not to elect to accept the tender offer or not to elect to accept a tender offer, or to be free to sell it someplace else.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.255" offset="2966839">And that choice is not to be tampered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.274" offset="2978960">Indeed, the congressional statements are replete with the idea that there is a delicate balance that cannot be tipped.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.444" offset="3007590">This Court recognized as much in the Piper Aircraft case, when it said that 14(e) was directed to a whole range of conduct by a whole range of persons who were seeking to influence either the price of or the outcome of a tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.855" offset="3077285">Now perhaps the best example of congressional intent is what Congress directed the Securities and Exchange Commission to do with respect to issuing regulations under 14(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="755.500" offset="3155861">It may recall to the Court that 14(d) also prescribes the necessity for a tender offer to contain full information, and the Commission has issued tons of regulations under 14(d) requiring full disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.992" offset="3213853">But in 14(e)... and I only quote two of those regulations... it requires, first, that the tender offer be kept open for 20 business days, and in subdivision (c) provides that when the tender offer is completed consideration has to be paid promptly or, if it's terminated, the tendered securities have to be returned promptly.</text>

            <text syncTime="843.557" offset="3508096">When they cancelled the 51 percent subscribed tender offer, not because of any event which had occurred outside but solely by virtue of the intervention of the El Paso management to induce Burlington Northern to make a better deal for the El Paso management and caused a new offer to be made under more restrictive terms in the sense of less shares, while tying up the stock, the balance of the stock needed to obtain control so that no one else, no other white knight would come in and offer a competitive bid, that manipulated the situation vis-a-vis the El Paso stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.599" offset="3660234">And, more importantly, we say what it did do was take away the results and fruits of the prior tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.705" offset="3692730">We say 14(e) has to cover a situation in which a tender offer is made pursuant to the regulations, pursuant to the statute, full information having been given, the shareholders of the target company make their choice and tender, and so that the offer is fully subscribed for.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.233" offset="3770784">To have respondents then take away the fruits of that choice tampers with the free choice that was given to the shareholders under 14(e).</text>

            <text syncTime="1063.333" offset="4387169">That showing was permitted in Mobil because it arose under different procedural circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.571" offset="4408172">Now my brothers ignore the rule that a 12(b)(6) motion kind of addresses only the complaint and attempt to assert a whole slew of other facts, principally addressed to the fact that respondents acted in good faith and a slew of related circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.365" offset="4471283">I must say not only were we deprived of the opportunity to contest that, but in fact that is contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.502" offset="4495839">We say... no matter what they say, we say the outs do not apply and did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.388" offset="4515378">And we say further that whatever facts they have asserted, these outside facts, they are the subject of great dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.060" offset="4546098">For example, respondents argue that the second stage of the Burlington Northern offer... as Your Honors know, in a tender offer, frequently after control occurs later on they make a tender for the balance of the shares in order to merge the companies in, and that's what occurred here with respect to the second tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.872" offset="4617360">That under the second stage, the target shareholders received, those who hadn't tendered at the first stage, got $24 in consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.294" offset="4651006">We contest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.311" offset="4655081">What they got was $12 in cash and some paper which we say, had we been given the opportunity, we would have demonstrated that that was not worth the $24 cash offered in the original 51 percent subscribed tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.106" offset="4722268">Now I think I have recited to Your Honors the factual pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.725" offset="4740763">My brothers try to argue that their... that those kinds of things are really breach of contract, breach of fiduciary obligations, and suggest to you that those are best left to the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.949" offset="4785693">We say that that is clearly not that they have attempted to isolate the transaction into different parts, but that the transaction is a continuous one and running it continuously through there was an attempt taken to interfere with the franchise given to the target company shareholders to make their election and, as a result, damage occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.196" offset="4870643">Now I might remind the Court of what the Second Circuit said a long time in the Crane Company case, that manipulative schemes should not be allowed to succeed solely because they are novel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.106" offset="4926336">Now my brothers argue that the state courts provide a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.092" offset="4950265">I'd like to address that for a few moments because I think that really poses a false issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.977" offset="4969804">The fact is the state courts and state remedies are totally inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.865" offset="4985269">Let me demonstrate why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.233" offset="4998748">You have a national offer which spreads over 50 states pursuant to Federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.237" offset="5026856">The injured shareholders will now have to sue in any one of those 50 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.475" offset="5051724">State one may claim the conduct was legal; state two may say the conduct was impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.379" offset="5079414">Each of the tender offer states will find litigations ensuing at different stages; the net result will be that the tender offer will be clogged with endless litigation, with no real resolution as to whether an injury has occurred or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.221" offset="5134794">There being no uniform standards of what fiduciary conduct or breach of contract are vis-a-vis all 50 states, state A may rightly say there was no breach of fiduciary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.779" offset="5184949">State B may say there was.</text>

            <label>Mr. Marc P. Cherno</label>
            <text syncTime="1508.755" offset="6168929">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The question in this case, as we see it, is whether Congress, when it enacted the Williams Act, meant for the courts to fashion, without any congressional guidelines or any standards, a Federal common law of contract or of corporate governance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.469" offset="6247714">The answer is, as we see it, by any standard in which statutes are interpreted, that Congress intended no such result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.860" offset="6289301">Any such result, any such cause of action, such as plaintiff claims here, would be inconsistent first with the plain language of the statute, the plain language of the Williams Act, which talks in terms of fraud, of deception, of manipulation, and not in terms of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.422" offset="6363594">It would be inconsistent with the legislative history of the Williams Act, which demonstrates over and again that the Williams Act was intended as a disclosure statute, intended to provide and extend the disclosure regulations which existed for other change in control transactions, such as proxy contests and exchange offers, to what it viewed as the new phenomenon of a cash tender offer, which it viewed as functionally equivalent to those other change in control transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.243" offset="6494833">It would be inconsistent with the legislative history of section 14(e) itself, which clearly was intended to police and regulate the new disclosure obligations created by the remainder of the Williams Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.051" offset="6550108">And it would be inconsistent with the teachings and dispositive opinions of this Court, particularly the decisions in the Piper-Chris-Craft case and the Santa Fe-Green case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.394" offset="6607473">And it would be inconsistent with the fundamental principles of federalism which infuse and underly the relationships between the Federal securities laws, on the one hand, and state law on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.320" offset="6663166">And those principles basically are that the Federal securities laws regulate the disclosure that's to be made to people who are asked to engage in securities transactions, and they regulate, in some instances, procedures designed to make sure that that disclosure is effective, and that the state law, on the other hand, which was never intended to be supplanted by the Federal securities laws, regulate matters of contract, matters of corporate governance, matters of fiduciary obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.357" offset="6791270">So creating this new and totally uncharted and uncontoured cause of action that petitioner would have the Court create would be inconsistent, I submit, with all of those basic principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.182" offset="6846545">Indeed, it would be to do what Justice Brennan warned against in the Bergsen-Lasker case, and that is to have the Federal... where he said that the Federal courts were not to fashion an entire body of Federal corporate law out of whole cloth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.044" offset="6914046">They would have to do that if the cause of action which petitioner seeks to create actually came into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.964" offset="6941736">Now before I go to the facts which underlie this case, I'd like to mention a few things on Mr. Bizar's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.688" offset="6988652">In the first instance, Mr. Bizar said he's not suing for breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.242" offset="7006833">If I read his complaint correctly, that's all he's suing for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.294" offset="7023029">When he talks in his complaint about what violates the Williams Act, what violates section 14(e) in paragraph 25, what he says was that the conduct violated the Williams Act in the following respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.256" offset="7094918">(a) The improper termination and withdrawal of a tender offer constituted a willful breach of the tender offer agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.243" offset="7126787">Now that's precisely a breach of contract claim and that is precisely what's going on in the state court with respect to this very transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.551" offset="7168061">There is a litigation pending in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.752" offset="7180913">It's a litigation called the Gilbert case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.537" offset="7191989">It was started by a group of shareholders similarly situated to Mr. Bizar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.673" offset="7212573">It was certified as a class action and indeed it includes Mr. Bizar's client among the plaintiffs in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.529" offset="7247995">In that Delaware state court action, there is being litigated at this moment whether Burlington in fact breached its contractual obligations to El Paso shareholders, whether in fact El Paso directors violated in any way, shape or form their fiduciary obligations to their shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.878" offset="7333363">Those are the precise litigation that is going on in the Delaware state court, and that's the court where it should be going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.048" offset="7362098">Now to create the cause of action that petitioner seeks to create would not only be contrary to every principle of statutory interpretation but it would be entirely unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.308" offset="7423120">It would simply and merely duplicate the existing causes of action under state law, which, as I said, are proceeding right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.099" offset="7466274">And, in fact, as I pointed out in our brief, the state court has already held that the outs which Mr. Bizar has claimed do not exist in fact exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.506" offset="7515907">It has already held on our motion for summary judgment that Burlington Northern had an absolute right under the contract conditions contained in the tender offer to terminate its contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.381" offset="7563345">To create this cause of action would be to allow Federal courts, without any standards, any contours, or any guidelines, to fashion Federal common law without any notice to any of the parties who may be involved in tender offers as to what conduct might be prohibited and what conduct might be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.281" offset="7663029">Any such cause of action could only, in the long run, unnecessarily burden, inhibit and deter tender offers, and defeat the very tender offers which Congress wishes to regulate and to preserve when it enacted the Williams Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.641" offset="7728439">And an example of this is shown by what's happened after the Sixth Circuit's Mobil decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.028" offset="7749964">And to respond, let me interject that it's the Second Circuit, the Third Circuit, the Fourth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit, the Eighth Circuit, and the Seventh Circuit which have all held... they have all rejected Mobil and all held that the misleading of investors is required under 14(e) for a cause of action to be stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.125" offset="7838363">But to come back, in the aftermath of the Sixth Circuit's Mobil decision every single thing that's happened in a tender offer has been called a manipulative device by a plaintiff's attorney and everything has been hauled into a Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.570" offset="7900116">Now all of those Federal courts have rejected those claims, but the burdens, the expense, the unnecessary inhibition of tender offers is precisely what's happened and precisely what would happen if this type of cause of action were sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.049" offset="7974095">The facts of this case I should turn to, because this is a case in which the facts are absolutely dispositive for if the conduct at issue in this case could be called fraud, there is no conduct which couldn't be called fraud in some allegation under the Federal securities laws, and you would have an automatic Federal cause of action for any conduct that takes place in a tender offer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.401" offset="8287460">Now the facts of this case, I think, are, as I said, dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.853" offset="8305223">What was the bottom line of what Burlington Northern did?</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.471" offset="8323718">What it did was make a premium acquisition of El Paso Corporation at a price which provided premium prices to all El Paso shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.677" offset="8360603">At every step along the way it told El Paso shareholders what did happen and what could have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.116" offset="8390278">It made a tender offer for 50 percent of El Paso's stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.801" offset="8405115">The tender offer was at a premium price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.253" offset="8414833">The offer included conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.205" offset="8426640">All tender offers include conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.324" offset="8435208">There is no claim that those conditions were not unequivocally stated, in the plaintiff's language, to shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.644" offset="8464465">And what those conditions are for, as they always are, is to protect an offeror and its own shareholders, who have committed hundreds of millions of dollars to an acquisition effort from circumstances which could defeat or frustrate the purpose of an offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.421" offset="8527577">The shareholders were fully informed of these conditions and they were fully informed of the fact that if any of these events took place that could lead to the termination of the offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.459" offset="8567701">And there's been no claim by Mr. Bizar that they were not so fully informed or that there was anything confusing or misleading in any way about these conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.065" offset="8606154">They were unequivocally stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.184" offset="8614617">And let me say that these conditions were not arcane or abstruse or irrational or arbitrary, although they could have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.940" offset="8645651">An offeror has, I submit, the same freedom of contract as any other party that conducts business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.610" offset="8672296">These conditions were essential, basic conditions that went to the heart of the acquisition process and the acquisition effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.780" offset="8705001">What were they?</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.466" offset="8711688">They were, first, if anyone instituted litigation seeking to enjoin the offer, that was a basis on which the offer could be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.988" offset="8745856">Again, an offeror hardly has to run the risk of being tied up in endless litigation if it chooses to avoid that risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.510" offset="8779920">If any governmental body attempted to come in and enjoin the tender offer, again that was a condition which permitted Burlington Northern to withdraw that offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.799" offset="8821089">If the target company issued any stock, any new class of stock, which would dilute the voting rights that the offeror hoped to acquire by the offer, again that was an event which permitted the offer to be withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.863" offset="8897262">If the target company threatened to sell its assets, again an event which permitted the tender offer to be withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.449" offset="8931639">And again that just makes obvious good sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.003" offset="8945850">One wouldn't want to go through with a tender offer and find that the assets that it made the tender offer for in the first place were gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.824" offset="8973122">There's no principle of securities law or contract law which says that you have to wait till the horse is gone to close the barn door.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.013" offset="9005932">And that again was a clear provision in the tender offer contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.417" offset="9027561">And a particularly important provision and one that shareholders were totally on notice of is that the offer could be terminated if an acquisition agreement was reached between the offeror and the target company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.061" offset="9102062">That's the way most acquisitions indeed take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.430" offset="9119616">That's the way many hostile offers are ultimately resolved and shareholders were told in unequivocal terms that what ultimately happened was exactly what could happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.923" offset="9169563">If El Paso and Burlington Northern got together and reached an agreement, that would permit Burlington Northern to terminate this tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.446" offset="9207597">There is no question that they were precisely on notice that that's what could happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.683" offset="9228599">Now in addition to that happening, almost all of the other events that could give rise to the right to terminate this tender offer in fact took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.305" offset="9271127">There was extensive litigation instituted by El Paso against this tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.709" offset="9292652">On the eve of the... on the morning that the agreement between Burlington and El Paso was reached, that litigation was about to go to trial in El Paso, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.100" offset="9338209">The State of Texas came in and instituted a state antitrust action seeking to enjoin this offer, and again on that same morning that antitrust action was going to go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.344" offset="9399231">El Paso issued preferred stock, the effect of which would have been to dilute the voting rights that Burlington would have acquired if it had gone ahead with the tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.417" offset="9447505">That was the precursor of the poison pill preferred stock that people now talk about in tender offers, and it's nice to know from Mr. Bizar that we would have gotten that declared illegal, but it never happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.059" offset="9498079">The court had not yet rendered its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.094" offset="9510199">It had not told any of us how it was going to rule, and the court had not ruled as of the day the agreement was reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.783" offset="9541024">And Mr. Bizar's statement is just fanciful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.485" offset="9551786">It's just made up out of whole cloth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2488.602" offset="10088237">There was a tender offeror and there was a favored bidder that had entered into a merger agreement with the target company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.708" offset="10128674">On the last day before the hostile tender offeror's tender offer was about to expire, what this other merger partner did was go into the market, buy a lot of securities in unreal transactions, because they were secret sales that were to take place the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.954" offset="10213625">It drove up the price of the target company stock beyond the tender offer price that the hostile offeror was offering, and operated to defeat the tender offer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2651.253" offset="10738895">Let me... coming back to the facts of this case, all of these conditions, all of these events, came into place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.525" offset="10779959">I was mentioning the sale of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.377" offset="10787378">El Paso went out and announced that it was going to sell and negotiating to sell its major assets, again a clear condition which permitted us to withdraw the tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.070" offset="10846101">So what did Burlington... in light of all these conditions, I submit, it is clear that Burlington could have withdrawn its offer, packed its bags and gone home entirely and had nothing more to do with El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.686" offset="10936590">Under those circumstances, El Paso shareholders would have gotten nothing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.138" offset="10950382">No one would have gotten a premium price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.406" offset="10959473">What it did instead was something that was far more beneficial to El Paso shareholders, and that was to enter into an agreement with El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.345" offset="10999283">Let me say one other thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.511" offset="11003881">At the time that this agreement was entered into there's a lot of talk about us having the shares locked up in our treasury, that we had the right to purchase them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.819" offset="11045154">We had no right to purchase those shares at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.355" offset="11055290">The shareholders had two more days in which to withdraw their tenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.990" offset="11073785">The world knows that a lot of things happen to tender offers in those two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.644" offset="11092488">If a white knight or some other party had come in on one of those two days, we have no right to buy those shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.881" offset="11117357">So just as we had the right under our contract to terminate the tender offer, El Paso shareholders similarly had the right under the Williams Act to withdraw their tenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.855" offset="11161243">Both sides at that moment in time still had the rights provided for them both by the Williams Act and by the contractual provisions themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.711" offset="11204710">So what we did, what Burlington and El Paso did, was enter into an agreement which... a normal and typical acquisition agreement which provided benefits for everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.602" offset="11252253">The benefit it provided for Burlington, first, is that we were able to acquire the 50 percent interest that we had sought to acquire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.292" offset="11283078">Another benefit it provided for Burlington was that we were freed from the risks of the sale of assets, we were freed from the risks of a court injunction, El Paso agreed to use its best efforts with the State of Texas to get it to terminate the state antitrust action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.503" offset="11355907">We were not freed, by the way, from the risk of a white knight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.907" offset="11373461">In fact, since the mechanism that was adopted was a new tender offer with a new 20 business days, a white knight... there was more opportunity in fact for a white knight to come in under this mechanism than there would have been if we had gone ahead with our tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.067" offset="11434170">But we were freed from the particular risk that the contract, the tender offer contract itself, sought to protect us against.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.273" offset="11466980">What did this do for El Paso shareholders?</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.457" offset="11483698">First, it got them the premium prices that we were offering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.009" offset="11497909">Second, El Paso asked and we agreed to put $100 million of badly-needed capital, what El Paso's directors believed was badly-needed capital into the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.467" offset="11543780">Third, and most important, I think, from El Paso's shareholders' rights or standpoint is El Paso exacted and Burlington agreed that... to very important protections against any second-step merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.244" offset="11606787">Previously, one of El Paso's complaints about our tender offer was that there were no protections whatever if we... if, after we had acquired the 50 percent we wanted to go ahead and acquire the company, the rest of the shares, in a merger transaction, we could dictate the price; we'd have majority ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.057" offset="11686095">What El Paso management exacted from us is an undertaking that would have no second-step merger transactions unless it was approved by a majority of the remaining El Paso directors who are not associated with Burlington, and unless it was approved by a majority of the remaining minority public shareholders... non-Burlington shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.742" offset="11796854">That was the nature of the agreement and it's an agreement that made a lot of sense to everyone concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.496" offset="11823812">And in fact what happened later on down the pike was a merger was completed and it was completed under the procedures set up under that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.871" offset="11869370">Now, Your Honors, if that constitutes fraud, there is nothing that doesn't constitute fraud under the Federal securities act and any claim of any nature could be alleged to be fraud or manipulative or deceptive and brought into Federal court and a wholly new and uncharted and uncontoured burden could be placed on those who participate in tender offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.153" offset="11962470">That is not what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.105" offset="11974278">Coming back to the statutory guidelines, let's talk for a second about the plain language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.425" offset="11999564">If there's one thing about plain... if there's one thing that's plainer, it's that contract doesn't mean fraud and that fraud doesn't mean contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.365" offset="12035300">The words "fraudulent", "deceptive", and "manipulative" do not mean contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.935" offset="12057556">It's easy to regulate contractual relationships if Congress wants to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.673" offset="12080544">It could write the word down; it didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.423" offset="12091515">It used in fact words which are almost jurisprudentially opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.327" offset="12111159">It used tort concepts, fraud concepts, deception concepts, not contract concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.080" offset="12138222">If it wanted to regulate the breach of fiduciary obligations, it could do that also.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.067" offset="12158180">It didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.917" offset="12161523">Let's talk about the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.086" offset="12170196">The Williams Act is blessed with an extensive legislative history and it's blessed with a very pointed legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.042" offset="12202065">And what that legislative history says over and again is this is a disclosure statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.196" offset="12226621">It's intended to extend the disclosure protections which exist on other types of change in control transactions to cash tender offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.718" offset="12268730">This is a new phenomenon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.287" offset="12274999">It's not regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.856" offset="12281269">Let's extend those disclosure protections to cash tender offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.640" offset="12300390">It says that over and over again in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.275" offset="12314914">There isn't a word in the legislative history to suggest that Congress was concerned with contractual issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.179" offset="12338529">There isn't a word in the legislative history to suggest that Congress was concerned with the conditions that were put on contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.769" offset="12368936">There isn't any of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.471" offset="12379698">It's not a question... I suggest that before you displace a whole body of state law you'd have to have the most clearest and unequivocal statement of congressional intent to do that, but you don't even come close to that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.629" offset="12432361">You don't have a word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.814" offset="12437168">You don't have an iota.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.697" offset="12440616">You don't have an inkling of congressional intent to accomplish such a broad-gauged, sweeping purpose as displacing state law, regulating contract, regulating fiduciary obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.171" offset="12490562">That's just not what Congress was about, and there's nothing in the legislative history that remotely suggests it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.092" offset="12518252">Let's talk about the legislative history of section 14(e) itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.193" offset="12534656">There you have a much sparser legislative history and the reason is, I submit, because no one suggested that section 14(e) was intended to do anything singularly new in the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.488" offset="12595783">It was intended to be the same type of anti-fraud provision as applied to tender offers as already existed in the anti-fraud... in the securities laws with respect to other transactions, and one hardly needs a lot of congressional statements to accomplish that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.717" offset="12668717">The language of the statute was clearly modeled on an amalgam of rule 10(b)(5) and section 10(b), and it was obviously intended to police the disclosure obligations which the rest of the Williams Act was creating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.393" offset="12735381">It's clearly what section 14(e) was about.</text>
