            <text syncTime="85.020" offset="476909">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="93.459" offset="510659">For over 50 years Section 17 of the Pueblo Lands Act was considered to authorize the public conveyance of a right-of-way across their lands, provided only that that conveyance was approved by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.469" offset="574711">No further congressional authorization or legislation was deemed necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.606" offset="599266">That was the interpretation of the Department of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.641" offset="615462">It was based on the language of Section 17 and it was an interpretation that was put into practice and concurred in by the Pueblos.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.914" offset="652452">The Department of Interior practice resulted in over 60 grants of rights-of-way across the lands of the Pueblos in the State of New Mexico and spanned a period of time of over 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.006" offset="708876">Mountain Bell holds such a Section 17 right-of-way.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.160" offset="729461">It was granted to it by the Respondent Pueblo Santa Ana in 1928.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.545" offset="750986">It was approved that same year by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.516" offset="766868">Prior to 1928, in the fall of 1927, Mountain Bell was named in a quiet title action that had been brought under Section 3 of the Pueblo Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.074" offset="817128">That action was styled United States of America as guardian for the Pueblo of Santa Ana versus Charles Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.679" offset="855580">The complaint alleged that the Defendants held right titles and interests to the lands of the Pueblos or at least claimed such interest and asked that those interests be declared null and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.439" offset="910646">The complaint also alleged that the Defendants were trespassing across the property of the Pueblo and asked that the trespass be enjoined by an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.378" offset="950352">Mountain Bell was dismissed from that lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.799" offset="972086">It secured a right-of-way from the Pueblo in February of 1928 and within six weeks the legal representative representing the Pueblos moved to dismissed Mountain Bell from the Brown action on the grounds that since the institution of the suit Mountain Bell had secured good and sufficient title to its right-of-way over the premises and controversy under Section 17 of the Pueblo Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.718" offset="1083681">The order of dismissal by the District Court Judge recited substantially similar statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.789" offset="1111998">In 1980, the Pueblo of Santa Ana sued Mountain Bell again.</text>

            <text syncTime="919.536" offset="3814940">The agency stopped using Section 17 which is not at all surprising because in 1926 Congress enacted legislation that would have allowed utilities to go ahead and condemn Pueblo property without any participation or consent by the Pueblo and without any participation by the United States and, indeed, because of that reason a District Court in New Mexico ruled that it was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.336" offset="3918176">Therefore, in 1908 and 1928 Congress adopted legislation that the general right-of-way statutes that applied to the other Indian tribes in the United States would also be applicable to the Pueblo.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.946" offset="3972615">At that point in time, there really is no necessity to use Section 17, although it does seem to appear from the record that the Secretary used Section 17 whenever a Pueblo was willing to consent to give the right-of-way and only use the 1928 Act initially when a Pueblo refused to consent to give a right-of-way.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.777" offset="4055998">The reason I said that about inside or outside of the record is I understand there is a filing by the Pueblo of Taos which attaches the Department of Interior letter to the Solicitor General where they take the position that Section 17 should not have been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.757" offset="4135828">And, in response to that, I would only say that the amicus brief filed before this Court is filed on behalf of the United States and I would assume the decision has been made that that was an appropriate administrative practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1077.238" offset="4445849">Well, I think the justification is we reached the Tenth Circuit and, indeed, reached this Court was because that is what the record was based on and that is what the administrative practice basically involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.045" offset="4489003">At the time this interpretation was developed, it seems quite clear from reading the legislative hearings that Congress simply did not address one way or another the question of rights-of-way when it was discussing the Pueblo Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.138" offset="4549399">It did discuss, however, the fact that the Pueblos had, since this Court's decision in Joseph, been conveying... making conveyances of their property without any United States participation or approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.315" offset="4606137">It was also informed that after this Court's decision in Joseph the territorial courts of New Mexico had held that the Pueblos were subject to the New Mexico state statutes of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.872" offset="4656292">So, there were two evils that Congress was informed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.591" offset="4671234">They were informed that one of those evils was being remedied at the time the hearings on this Act were held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.495" offset="4698819">Congress was informed that since the New Mexico Enabling Act and since this Court's decision in United States v. Sandoval that Pueblo alienations, conveyances, and leases were being approved by the Department and that is how the exercise of guardianship had been put into practice in New Mexico regarding Pueblo conveyancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.094" offset="4793173">The Pueblos historically had the power to convey their property under the Spanish Sovereignty provided that it was approved by the Sovereign and there is support for that proposition into the Mexico jurisdiction in cases of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.055" offset="4861092">There is nothing in the legislative history that would indicate that Congress meant to deprive the Pueblos of their historical power to convey property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.196" offset="4901634">The only thing in the legislative history is that the Sovereign's approval was being exercised since this Court indicated in Sandoval that some kind of guardianship responsibility or relationship was involved with the Pueblo Indians and the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1310.457" offset="5378630">I would like to read the second clause of Section 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.675" offset="5399528">It is that section on which Mountain Bell relies to support the validity of its right-of-way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.085" offset="6069203">It states that</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.563" offset="6069098">"no sale, grant, lease of any character, or other conveyance of lands, or any title or claim thereto, made by any Pueblo as a community, or any individual Indian living in a Pueblo community in the State of New Mexico, shall be of any validity in law or in equity unless the approved by the Secretary of the Interior. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.576" offset="6068994">There are two things that are fairly obvious about that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.213" offset="6068889">The first is that it is directed to conduct that originates with the Pueblo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.450" offset="6068785">The Pueblo is the acting body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.267" offset="6068680">They make a conveyance or the individual Indian is an active conveyor, the body that does the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.306" offset="6068576">The section then is clearly talking about consensual and voluntary activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.210" offset="6068471">The second thing that is fairly obvious about the language is that it is language substantially similar to the Non-Intercourse Act of 1834 that was on the books at the time the Pueblo Lands Act was passed in 1924.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.969" offset="6068367">That statute as written was by 1924 an anachronism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.973" offset="6068262">It still read that a treaty or a convention was required, but in 1871 Congress had stated that no more treatying should be done with the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.265" offset="6068158">Therefore, the second clause of Section 17 substitutes for something that was already anachronistic, a requirement of Secretarial approval to validate the Indian conveyance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.656" offset="6068053">And, as I have explained, the approval of the Department of Interior was the way that the United States had been exerting its guardianship at the time the Pueblo Lands Act hearings were taking place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.832" offset="6067949">The Secretarial approval requirement, as I said, took the place of the treaty or convention requirement and to the extent that the people involved in the transaction complied with the restriction, the conveyance that was attendant to that statute was valid in the same way that a conveyance made within the confines of a treaty or a convention was clearly valid under the Non-Intercourse Act of 1834.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.194" offset="6067844">The first clause of Section 17, on the other hand, is written in language distinctly different from the second clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.819" offset="6076099">"no right, title, or interest in or to the lands of the Pueblos to which their title has not been extinguished as hereinbefore determined shall hereafter be acquired or initiated by virtue of the laws of the State of New Mexico or in any other manner except as may hereafter be provided by Congress. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.499" offset="6154884">That language uses language characteristic of an involuntary transaction, something that is done against the Pueblo as opposed to done with their concurrence on their origination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2002.212" offset="8145728">Congress at that time was still adhering to the policy of allotment, but until Congress went ahead and issued allotments and removed the restrictions on alienation that are commonly given to allotments, individuals couldn't sell.</text>

            <text syncTime="2058.215" offset="8369755">But, that is quite a different kind of authorization from the second kind of authorization you spoke of.</text>

            <text syncTime="2062.619" offset="8387309">Indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.669" offset="8391488">The authorization that Congress was referring to for sales by individuals was something it contemplated doing in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.475" offset="8422731">Likewise, it contemplated in the future allowing tribal lands to be conveyed under various statutes that Congress would pass allowing the very limited kinds of conveyances for rights-of-way, for leases, for other purposes that Congress has done both before and since the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.735" offset="8487828">The second clause of Section 17 merely references the existing statutes by which Congress had already authorized very limited transactions in Indian land and it refers to the future, both in allotment and for tribal lands to acts of Congress that would allow future conveyances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.629" offset="8559403">The significant thing about Section 17 is that the first clause addresses the evil that Congress sought to remedy in the Pueblo Lands Act, namely, conveyances and losses of Pueblo land through adverse possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.222" offset="8613738">The first clause completely wipes out any kind of loss of Pueblo land without congressional authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.610" offset="8643309">The second clause simply references that the Secretary of the Interior who did have broad supervision over administration of Pueblo lands must approve transactions when those transactions must be approved under the congressional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.469" offset="8702763">It is highly unlikely that Congress would in the future pass any kind of a statute that would not require Secretarial approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.391" offset="8734424">As noted by Mountain Bell, the second clause addresses conveyances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.795" offset="8751978">Congress has generally required Secretarial supervision for conveyances of allotted Indian lands and further kinds of transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.068" offset="8789072">Congress was not going to pass a law in the future saying that the Pueblos could convey independently of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.472" offset="8814777">That has been a fundamental part of the Secretary's role in supervising and managing Indian lands throughout the last 90 to 100 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.827" offset="8848109">Section 17 must be viewed in a common-sense way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.712" offset="8867648">It must be viewed as simply declaratory statement by Congress that the Pueblos were subject to the full benefits and protections of the Indian Non-Intercourse Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.254" offset="8913833">The Pueblo Lands Act sought to give effect to this Court's decision in United States v. Sandoval which held that the Pueblos were tribal Indians subject to the same protections and having the same status as other tribal Indians in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.132" offset="8985408">That reversed a prior decision and finally gave effect to the intent of Congress in 1851 when it extended the Non-Intercourse Act to New Mexico specifically to protect the Pueblos.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.641" offset="9035459">So, the evil that Congress sought to remedy in 1924 was that long history of maybe 30 or 40 years from the Joseph decision where the Pueblos were placed in a unique status, stripped of the protections of congressional control of their lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.651" offset="9103482">Congress had no reason to turn around in the same Act by which it had accomplished that goal and simply cast the Indians adrift, subject only to the unbridled discretion of the Secretary or his lesser subordinate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.678" offset="9159593">The interpretation that Mountain Bell is advancing here would authorize conveyances going all the way down the line through the bureaucracy of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.218" offset="9201702">Transactions and approvals for leases and rights-of-way even today are commonly done at the agency level and it would just simply be absurd to presume that Congress intended to give that kind of authority to low-level bureaucrats within the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.245" offset="9269830">That is not the kind of protection that Congress has historically sought to give Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.216" offset="9289683">Congress has very jealously retained its own power and its own authority over unseeded, unallotted Indian lands, the lands on which Indians are living.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.155" offset="9329493">When lands have been seeded or when lands have been allotted, Congress has generally allowed some kinds of broader control to the Secretary, but that is part of the emancipation process that allotment sought to promote.</text>

            <text syncTime="3101.800" offset="12544017">The documents that we lodged with the Court show that in some instances the lands that were... the precise same lands that should have been covered by Section 16 were conveyed under Section 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.124" offset="12585395">Presumably... It is not clear, but presumably to avoid the requirement that they be put up for bid to the highest bidder.</text>

            <text syncTime="3127.617" offset="12647358">Some of them were on the edge of the town of Bernalillo in New Mexico and they were sold for seven or eight dollars an acre, whereas the appraised value at the time was probably a couple of hundred dollars an acre.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.692" offset="12695632">Section 17 was also used to validate some invalid, concededly void deeds that were issued in 1880 for the consideration of a dollar to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.317" offset="12742130">Section 17 had a highly irregular use.</text>

            <text syncTime="3252.432" offset="13146610">It has been... I don't think you will find in recent legislative history any effort by an Indian tribe that is subject to the Non-Intercourse Act asking to be relieved of the Non-Intercourse Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.358" offset="13202303">Indian tribes... It is just inconceivable because the history of allotment which did result in the removal of restrictions on alienation resulted in a massive, massive loss of Indian land and that was rejected and reversed in 1934 under the Indian Reorganization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.486" offset="13274819">And, Congress has expressly repudiated that entire policy of giving Indian tribes the power to alienate their lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.359" offset="13306270">Congress, moreover, had no reason to enact Section 17 as interpreted by Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.548" offset="13343051">Congress was informed, as Mountain Bell admits, that the general procedures for administering and governing Indian lands were being followed in 1924 when it enacted the Pueblo Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.689" offset="13395609">Congress had no reason to provide an additional means for providing conveyances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.676" offset="13411596">It certainly had no reason to cut off any access to existing means for acquiring rights-of-way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.563" offset="13435106">And, as I say, subsequent legislation refutes Mountain Bell's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.800" offset="13460079">In 1928, Congress passed a comprehensive statute that applied the existing statutes governing rights-of-way to the Pueblos.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.406" offset="13494457">That statute has been found by the Court of Appeals to be a comprehensive statute that covers the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.077" offset="13521206">It is certainly inconsistent to say that the conditions and the limits imposed by that statute, the 1982 statute, could be conveniently circumvented simply by citing Section 17 of the Pueblo Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.867" offset="13572301">In 1933, Congress broadened Section 16 of the Pueblo Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.355" offset="13590274">There is not an iota of an indication that Congress was aware that Section 17 had been interpreted to have the operative effect that it was being used for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.227" offset="13629771">Congress instead broadened the scope of conveyances under Section 16 but still left in all of the carefully defined protections that it had imposed in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.619" offset="13675328">In 1948, Congress passed a general Right-of-Way Act, specifically mentioning the Pueblos and requiring the consent of the tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.125" offset="13705317">If Congress was aware that Section 17, using tribal consent, could grant rights-of-way for all purposes, it certainly would not have referred to them in the 1948 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.115" offset="13753278">Finally, in 1968, Congress allowed four specific Pueblos to lease their lands for 99 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.669" offset="13783475">Petitioner's interpretation of Section 17 would allow those Pueblos to do that without the benefit... without the need for that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.477" offset="13822763">Any of the Pueblos could have leased their lands for 99 years or even have sold their lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.548" offset="13847005">There was absolutely no need in 1968 for that kind of statute if Section 17 had the operative effect attributed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.468" offset="13878770">In conclusion I would like to say that in three unanimous decisions of this court, U.S. v. Sandavol, U.S. v. Candelaria, and U.S. v. Chavez, the Pueblo Indians were found to be entitled to the exact same status and the exact same protections given other Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.663" offset="13943449">Section 17 was turned on its head and used to undermine the Non-Intercourse Act and to usurp the authority of Congress over Indian affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.721" offset="13987753">Petitioner's argument would have this Court place the Pueblo Indians in a unique status, stripped of some of the same protections as other Indian lands and could have implications beyond this decision and we ask the Court to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and to continue those protections for the Pueblo Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="3490.287" offset="14097990">The Non-Intercourse Act or the Section 17 is basically an adoption of the Non-Intercourse Act and shows that the second clause of Section 17 uses the language of the Non-Intercourse Act that was on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.047" offset="14160997">The first clause of Section 17 in essence is the first legislative statement of what had been held to be judicially the necessary implications of the Non-Intercourse Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.771" offset="14211883">If a conveyance was made within the confines of a treaty or a convention, it was valid, and if a transfer of land occurred in any other way voluntarily or involuntarily, it was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.429" offset="14258590">The courts have held you couldn't involuntarily transfer the land through statutes of limitations, through deeds that didn't comport with the requirements of a treaty or a convention or any other theory and that is basically what the first clause of Section 17 does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.041" offset="14320971">The argument that the Pueblos are in a status all by themselves is refuted at page 20 of Mountain Bell's opening brief and page six of its reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.562" offset="14359110">The Chickasaw and the Cherokee Tribes have been authorized to convey their property with the participation of their tribal agents or their counsels and with the approval of either the President of the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.620" offset="14407279">This is not an unparalleled kind of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.756" offset="14419923">It is not an usual power for Congress to grant, but the legislative hearings make quite clear that the Pueblo Indians, even in 1924, were not considered to be usual Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.964" offset="14464749">They were respected in their Mexican community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.516" offset="14478959">There is considerable debate in those hearing as to whether they are indeed citizens of New Mexico even though the Sandoval court did not decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.937" offset="14512605">There is considerable discussion in those legislative histories about conveyances that were made by individual Pueblo Indians, discussions about how the Pueblo Tribe had conveyed to an individual Indian who had turned around and conveyed to a non-Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.631" offset="14575403">Therefore, the language of Section 17 in almost every phrase and every clause has a distinct reference in the history as Congress knew it and we would ask this Court to reverse the Tenth Circuit's opinion on the grounds that Section 17 does not mean exactly what the Tenth Circuit said it meant.</text>
