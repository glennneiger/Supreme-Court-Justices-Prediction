            <text syncTime="42.889" offset="308034">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the statement of Oregon appears before this Court on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.236" offset="345441">This case presents an opportunity to avoid an unwarranted conflict between important principles of Indian treaty law and the fundamental sovereign powers of states over public lands and their regulatory dominion.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.072" offset="396850">That conflict would threaten important environmental and wildlife management policies of state and federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.408" offset="426107">The question is posed by the unambiguous language of a Congressionally ratified agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.353" offset="445960">That agreeded ceded reservation lands, and as all parties agree, diminished the physical size of the Klamath Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.177" offset="477203">In these circumstances, can tribal members nonetheless hunt and fish on the ceded land without observing state regulation which applies to all other Oregon citizens on that public land?</text>
            <text syncTime="98.997" offset="532478">Language, authority, and logic, we believe, require a negative answer to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.259" offset="549510">The Ninth Circuit decision below ignores the act of Indian reservation diminishment, and the decision below also ignores the explicit treaty language which limits the right in question to the reservation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.068" offset="600814">We will argue today for a general rule consistent with the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.314" offset="621817">That rule would provide that where the reservation boundaries are diminished, and where treaty rights are defined by the reservation area, those rights may only be exercised in the reduced area unless Congress specifies its intention to preserve them.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.822" offset="683779">But on the contrary, if treaty hunting and fishing or other rights are not limited by the reservation boundaries, they remain unaffected by the diminishment unless the Congress clearly modifies and expresses its intent to reduce them.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.971" offset="864442">Well, can you read that 1864 treaty as creating hunting and fishing rights in whatever land was in the reservation at that time but not that it is forever bound to that land.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.604" offset="930897">It could exist separate and apart from it.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.565" offset="942809">I don't think so, and this anticipates an argument I would make in a moment, but I will reach it now, and that is that the language of the treaty is very careful to express that the hunting and fishing... or that the fishing rights are "within its limits", and then when it goes on in the same sentence to confer the gathering rights given to the tribe, those are also expressed as within the limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.917" offset="1028177">So, two different phrases within the same session which creates the rights also explicitly limit those rights to the boundaries of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.044" offset="1064644">And if one looks to the purpose--</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="233.566" offset="1070809">Do you think the better reading of the treaty language then is to tie it irrevocably to the boundaries of the reservation?</text>

          <turn speaker="david_frohnmayer" startTime="242.822" stopTime="358.937">
            <label>Mr. David Frohnmayer</label>
            <text syncTime="242.822" offset="1107799">--Yes, because it is a reservation... it is the creation of on reservation rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.874" offset="1127965">Now, when Congress at this time wanted to create rights which existed off an Indian reservation, it knew how to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.760" offset="1155550">This Court in the classic case of Winans is a perfect example where fishing at the usual and accustomed places identifies geographic locations which may be removed from the meets and bounds of a specific reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.629" offset="1211035">So, a treaty may create off-reservation rights, but these rights in the specific grant by Congress are unequivocally within the limits of the reservation, and that is part of what we think are the undisputed facts here, and let me touch them briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.146" offset="1265056">In the 1864 treaty, the tribe ceded $20 million... or 20 million acres of aboriginal lands and received a reservation of some $1.9 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.982" offset="1300478">The language of sale of the aboriginal lands is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.195" offset="1313330">The tribe ceded all their right, title, and claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.507" offset="1326496">And as I have mentioned in my answer to your question, Justice O'Connor, the treaty provided for exclusive fishing rights in the streams and lakes included in said reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.454" offset="1366306">The gathering rights were also restricted within its limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.696" offset="1383338">The language was later construed by court decision to include hunting rights, but the treaty provides on its face and by no fair reading for any off-reservation rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.831" offset="1419805">Subsequently it was demonstrated that surveys erroneously had excluded some 621,000 acres from the tribal lands in the reservation, and other Poundary Commission proceedings and a new survey during which time the tribe was represented by independent legal counsel, it was agreed that the boundary dispute would be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.295" offset="1501725">The tribes agreed to cede to the United States those disputed 621,000 acres in exchange for approximately $533,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.101" offset="1536938">A 1969 Indian Claims Commission decision later awarded the Indians $4 million more for this to compensate for this transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="358.937" offset="1572256">Mr. Frohnmayer, is there anything to establish whether that Claims Commission considered the value of the tribal hunting and fishing rights when it made its award?</text>

            <text syncTime="373.029" offset="1628680">In the Claims Commission, counsel for both parties agreed that they should be compensated at fair market value and at the highest and best use.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.224" offset="1665461">It was agreed by the parties in those Claims Commissions that the highest and best use was for timber and grazing, and that was the basis of the compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.459" offset="1698375">The 1906 agreement which ratified the... the 1906 cession Act which ratified the bilateral agreement provided in Article 1, and this language is particularly important, that the Klamath Indians do</text>

            <text syncTime="417.309" offset="1805790">In its recitation of consideration, Article 2 of that same cession act provided that this was satisfaction</text>

            <text syncTime="431.258" offset="1861588">No express reservation was made in this 1906 Act for any residual hunting, fishing, or gathering rights on the ceded lands or indeed on any off-reservation areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.702" offset="1899309">The federal government immediately placed most of this land in Crater Lake National Park or in national forests.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.679" offset="1923237">The parties stipulated that the Indians continued to hunt, fish, and trap on the excluded lands without regard to state regulation, but also that they were unaware of any denial by the tribe that the state lacked this regulatory power, at least until proceedings were instituted in the instant case.</text>

            <text syncTime="469.362" offset="2013934">The state of Oregon didn't try to regulate the Indians in the national forest when they fished, or they thought they were regulating, but the Indians thought they weren't?</text>

            <text syncTime="479.277" offset="2053640">The latter construction is probably correct, and of course the state was a stranger to the agreement between the United States government and the tribes.</text>

            <text syncTime="862.643" offset="3587133">Well, the language of the cession agreement, which is the language which is unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.645" offset="3615136">When Congress wanted to preserve hunting and fishing rights in the ceded areas, it knew how to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.221" offset="3645438">Page 28, Footnote 5 of our opening brief cites authority to this Court in which it was regarded at the time as the normal practice, that when the Congress of the United States wished the tribes to retain aboriginal hunting or fishing rights or earlier hunting and fishing rights within the area to be ceded, they knew how to do so and they said so, and that was something for which there was bargain and sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.638" offset="3743031">And so what we have is, the very silence of the cession agreement indicates that the language of it, which is precisely suited to effect a diminishment, as this Court found in De Coteau and in Footnote 22 of De Coteau where it cites additional treaties at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.377" offset="3813980">The contemporaneous practice was perfectly clear to the Congress of the United States, and its intention to see that the reservation boundaries were diminished is, I think, unassailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.335" offset="3853895">Let me return to the question on which I had a colloquy with Justice Marshall a moment ago, because the tribe's position on compensation is anomalous.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.231" offset="3889422">Bear in mind that the fishing rights at issue here were exclusive fishing rights within the boundaries of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.396" offset="3922127">The tribe has conceded, apparently without much argument, that it lost exclusivity of those fishing rights, and now seeks to say that because it was not compensated for what obviously is the far lesser value, if indeed there is any value at all in being subject to state regulation, that therefore that lack of compensation shows that Congress must not have intended to do what it did in the cession language, and that is to include everything in the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.184" offset="4033199">We think the tribal argument is inconsistent, necessarily inconsistent by not complaining of the greater deprivation of the asserted right, and at the same time saying that the presence of the lesser deprivation without compensation therefore must mean that Congress must not have intended to include these rights because they were not included in the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.008" offset="4124524">We think that when the argument is pursued, it falls of its own weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.892" offset="4140093">Tribes retain no beneficial interest, as this Court has found was sufficient in some cases, the Ash Sheep case, for example.</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.466" offset="4170395">May I just interrupt with one thought that is troubling me?</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.568" offset="4182829">Your argument is that on the valuation point, omitting the hunting and fishing isn't significant because the timber and the grazing was the highest and best use for the land, and therefore an appropriate measure of use, and therefore you don't have to worry about other uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.587" offset="4238835">But does that totally meet the argument that the hunting and fishing rights might be not pertinent to the land at all, but a separate bundle of rights that wouldn't necessarily be included within the valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.136" offset="4281049">That is part of their argument, as I understand it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.169" offset="4289199">And I will confess, Justice Stevens, that we are perplexed by that argument, because the question that must be posed to the tribe, it seems to me, is what kind of right is it that is being claimed if it is not a treaty right or if it is not an occupancy right?</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.560" offset="4350744">The treaty gives two conceivable bases on which that right could be urged, the exclusive right to occupy the land or the fact that the treaty confers the right to fish, gather, and hunt within its limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.838" offset="4407900">But when both of those potential theoretical bases are destroyed by a cession agreement with respect to some part of the land, then what theoretical basis is left to assert that these are not--</text>

            <text syncTime="1080.297" offset="4457742">In other words, perhaps, to be sure I understand your point, you are saying that although theoretically they could exist separate and apart from a piece of land, they don't in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1091.033" offset="4500687">In many treaties, or at least in some treaties which have reached this Court, it is clear that the treaty right to hunt and fish can not only not be within the boundaries of the reservation, but it can be on the Columbia River many miles, for example, from the Akima Tribe's reservation, and this Court has held that where those conditions exist, the treaty right is protected and is not appurtenant to the... but here, the only two bases on which we can find for the assertion of hunting and fishing right in the ceded area is either that they come from the right to occupy, which no longer exists, or from the treaty language creating the rights, which says within its limits and within said reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.696" offset="4647286">But consider, if you will, this anomaly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.340" offset="4657839">The western part of the ceded land lies squarely within the boundaries of Crater Lake National Park.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.063" offset="4684798">Congress has prohibited hunting altogether in national parks, and has required that fishing be done only with hooks, and yet by the reasoning that the tribe now urges on us, either the tribe has a right, because that was ceded land, to hunt and fish free of state regulation, or it does not, because the federal government can bar it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.538" offset="4778630">So, not only have they started from an exclusive treaty right within the reservation, the right asserted now becomes one which is nonexclusive, nonuniform, because it apparently does not apply as against the federal government or private landowners, and can be exercised only to prohibit state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.372" offset="4853967">It is an anomalous right which is being asserted today, and one which analytically, I think, cannot be justified on the basis of the language and the law that is asserted to have created it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.379" offset="4893986">It is for that reason that we believe that the very analysis scheme which the tribe urges today would cause this Court to unravel all tribal cession agreements since the creation of this nation unless the Congressional language in that cession agreement explicitly extinguished hunting and fishing rights on the ceded land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.733" offset="4991475">We have yet to find a treaty that does so explicitly, and that presumably is one of the reasons which motivated this Court in the De Coteau decision to stay and to look to how unequivocal the language of bargain and sale is in the cession agreement to determine whether or not it was precisely suited to effect a diminishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1288.893" offset="5292093">One good example of that, a right which was perhaps not important at the time except that we know that Crater Lake was a sacred place for the Klamath Tribe as it indeed is for anyone who witnesses it, but the western boundary of the claimed land was right on the rim of Crater Lake, of inestimable value now for recreational and aesthetic purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.303" offset="5697722">The tribe rests its argument so far as we can tell, other than on a somewhat self-contradictory theory of the origin of these rights, on Article 4 of the cession agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.793" offset="5755714">We believe that they have misconstrued Article 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.025" offset="5768566">Article 4, by its terms, is a savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.907" offset="5788106">It grants no new rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.900" offset="5796151">It is typical of boilerplate language used in tribal agreements of that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.102" offset="5812974">In reading that clause to grant off-reservation hunting and fishing rights would by its terms be inconsistent with the treaty language that establishes those rights within the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.880" offset="5856024">Bear in mind the purpose of Article 4 is to keep the 1864 treaty and the 1906 cession consistent with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.615" offset="5886953">And yet what an inconsistency that would wreak, because instead of on-reservation exclusive rights to hunt and fish and gather, their reading of Article 4 would create off-reservation, non-exclusive, and non-universal rights, because, for example, of the national parks and because they concede that they can't hunt and fish on private land, at least without the consent of the landowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.459" offset="5986323">The rights that Article 4 was meant to save are plain within the balance of any fair reading of the 1864 treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.686" offset="6019237">That treaty gave allotments in perpetuity.</text>

            <label>Mr. Don Brantley Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="1551.700" offset="6343364">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the rights at issue here today are basic subsistence rights that continue to this day to play an extremely important role in the day to day lives of the Klamath Tribe and its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.301" offset="6429673">They are treaty rights that have been exercised continuously in the ceded area since before the 1864 treaty to the present time, and they are rights that have a very direct impact on how the Indians live their lives, and affect directly their ability to provide food for themselves and their families.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.209" offset="6521310">Indeed, the parties here have stipulated that in addition to the Indians' continuous use in this area, these rights were crucial to the survival of the Klamath Indians at the time of the 1906 cession Act, and that they continue to this day to play a highly significant role in the lives of the Klamath Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.792" offset="6611694">Now, no doubt because of this fundamental importance to the livelihood and existence of the Indians, Congress and this Court have traditionally been highly protective of treaty hunting and fishing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.531" offset="6666656">This right to hunt and fish free of state regulation has long been regarded as more than a mere jurisdictional prerogative of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.577" offset="6702809">Rather, it has been regarded as an important treaty right for the extinguishment of which just compensation must be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.083" offset="6732798">Now, in this case and, with all due respect, contrary to Mr. Frohnmayer's assertion, we would assert that there really is no practical reason why the 1906 Act should not be construed as preserving the tribe's treaty rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.041" offset="6796641">Because the 1954 Klamath Termination Act preserved these same treaty rights to hunt and fish on lands that were subject to that Act, the Klamath Indians now possess a decreed right to hunt and fish free of state regulation over roughly two-thirds of their 1864 treaty reservation, an area of approximately one million acres, and those lands, like the lands at issue here today, were sold, purchased by the federal government, and placed in the national forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.353" offset="6925895">Now, tribal law governs its members' exercise of hunting and fishing rights on those lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.667" offset="6951182">The tribe has cooperative agreements with the state of Oregon, the Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.631" offset="6975005">It has a wildlife code that establishes seasons and taking limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.076" offset="7000814">It issues ID's to its members, and it employs a wildlife biologist and four tribal enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.441" offset="7042297">So, whether the tribe retained its treaty rights to hunt and fish on the additional one-third of that 1864 reservation that was ceded in 1906, and which lands are comprised of essentially similar forest lands even today, is probably not of major practical consequence to the state of Oregon, and the record in this case certainly would indicate nothing to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3130.723" offset="12659355">And I would simply point to the Joint Appendix at Page 14, Stipulation Number 19, where the state has stipulated that the Commission did not take the tribe's hunting and fishing rights into consideration in making its assessment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Don Brantley Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="3165.646" offset="12799057">Now, the state has argued that this is an anomalous, very different, almost an oddball right, that this would be the only place where it would exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.335" offset="12849839">The point to be made is that this is a right, the right that we assert today is a right that was subsumed within the larger rights that the Indians before possessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.934" offset="12892262">It is the same identical right that exists today on the other two-thirds of their treaty reservation, and it is a right that exists on numerous other national forest lands throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.879" offset="12940014">It has been recognized time and again by various courts in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.014" offset="12960599">The thing that is different about this case is not the nature of the right asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.505" offset="12978571">The thing that is different is the manner in which the right was preserved, and Article 4, which we place great reliance on, means that the rights were only extinguished to the extent necessary to accomplish the purposes of the cession, and the purposes of this cession were not to open reservation lands to settlement, as was the case in virtually every other cession Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.912" offset="13076164">So, the retention of these rights on unfenced, unenclosed forest lands is consistent with the purposes of the cession, and the Indians surely must have understood that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.939" offset="13120259">They knew that Article 4 was in that agreement, and they knew that those lands out there were not going to be settled, that they were unenclosed, unfenced forest lands, that there was no population pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.158" offset="13169160">The exclusive nature of the right was probably unimportant to them at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.382" offset="13194029">Nobody else used those lands anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.673" offset="13203224">The important thing at the time was the right to be able to go out and continue to use those lands for their subsistence, and that is the way they would have understood it, we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.869" offset="13247946">Now, the adoption of the approach for which we have argued would simply mean that in each Indian land cession Act you would have to examine each Act in light of its own legislative history and its surrounding circumstances, and in adopting the rule that we propose, the Court should bear in mind that there really were very few cessions and diminishments that were effectuated for purposes other than opening the lands for settlement, and that is the key to the analysis of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.183" offset="13389216">This was a unique Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.885" offset="13396008">Its purpose was to settle a boundary dispute, honor treaty obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.648" offset="13419100">Its purpose was not to benefit non-Indian settlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.399" offset="13434146">Now, as we have suggested in our brief, it might well be in those cases where there was a diminishment as well as a cession of title and the lands were opened for settlement, in those cases, there might well be an extinguishment of the rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.263" offset="13517529">The totality of those circumstances might well rise to the level of clarity that has been required by this Court for an extinguishment of the treaty rights.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Frohnmayer</label>
            <text syncTime="3361.064" offset="13580746">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.786" offset="13591613">Briefly, six points, which I believe will not require all the time that I have reserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.480" offset="13610421">First, I must respectfully submit that opposing counsel has done in oral argument precisely what he has done in the briefs, and that is to confuse the language of Article 4, which does not speak to purposes of the cession agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.639" offset="13667054">It talks about provisions of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.920" offset="13676145">Provisions are clear, and speak for themselves, and do not require psychoanalysis of the parties or the Congress which enacted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.675" offset="13703208">The second point is that we have referred in our opening argument to the anomaly created by the special situation of Crater Lake National Park, the largest part of the western cession boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.572" offset="13750750">Federal law has since time immemorial, at least since the creation of the park, prohibited hunting altogether on that piece of ceded property, and yet it is anomalous because the right asserted is the right of subsistence to hunt and fish and the allegedly onerous nature of state regulations, which simply have bad limits and season limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.304" offset="13825774">The federal government with respect to its share of those lands in the national park prohibits hunting altogether, and yet no mention of how this is to be reconciled with the theoretical position of the tribe has yet been offered by our opponents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.422" offset="13874153">That leads to the point that we have heard no argument about the source of this asserted right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.494" offset="13894528">That source can only come from one of four sources: aboriginal right, the treaty right of 1864, the 1906 cession agreement, or some other contemporaneous Act of Congress which regranted to the tribe the authority to hunt and fish as it had before on the ceded land, and in fact none of those first three sources is conceivably the source, and therefore we must look to the fourth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.081" offset="13984808">Justice Stevens asked our worthy opponents for authority for their proposition, a point, I believe, echoed by Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.014" offset="14012602">Indeed, the authority cited is quite contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.127" offset="14029007">The Blackfoot treaty which was cited as an example, as counsel explained to this Court, where the cession agreement explicitly reserved hunting and fishing rights on the ceded land until such time as they were open to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.515" offset="14078535">The Winans case is a case where a treaty explicitly reserved off-reservation rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.850" offset="14103926">The Antoine case is a case in which the cession agreement explicitly reserved rights to hunt and fish on the ceded land, and in fact on Page 28, Footnote 5 of our brief, we cite authority to the proposition that when Congress wanted to reserve rights on ceded land, the normal practice was for the Congress of the United States to say so, and it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.074" offset="14184801">Justice Stevens in his colloquy with opposing counsel asked about the opposing interests of the state in the varieties of fish, game, and other wildlife management.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.538" offset="14218656">Justice Stevens, that is not in the stipulations of the parties, but in the motions to stay the District Court proceedings, the opposing views of counsel and affidavits with respect to the various practices are included in the record, and that may serve to answer your question there if that is a residual issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.560" offset="14282708">The point that the state raises is that the normal practice if something is other than a complete sale and cession and giving up of all rights in a cession agreement is for the Congress to have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.827" offset="14327848">The Congress knew how to say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.957" offset="14336311">The Congressional language is clear and undeniable, and yet the tribe shrinks in horror at the notion that with respect to land which is admittedly no longer in tribal domain but in the public domain, that the same rules, the same regulation to enhance wildlife and to protect the environment should apply to tribal members as well as to all the members of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.440" offset="14418231">We believe that the intention of Congress is otherwise, and that the ability of the state to regulate this land with an even hand in the interests of enhancing its wildlife resource ought to be preserved as against the theory which has no true basis in analytical consistency that we can discover.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.793" offset="14483642">Thank you very much.</text>
