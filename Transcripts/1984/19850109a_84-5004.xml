            <text syncTime="56.918" offset="348413">May it please the Court, I am here this morning on behalf of Truman Lewis Ball to ask the Court to vacate one of his convictions and one of his sentences under the cases of United States against Batchelder and Blockburger against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.990" offset="420720">This is a direct appeal from two convictions suffered by Mr. Ball, one for 922, receipt by a convicted felon of a firearm, and 1202, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.662" offset="491459">The government proved three incidences of possession in this case, all of which occurred at or about the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.238" offset="525732">The first was when Truman Ball reached into a bag of beer and came out with that gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.421" offset="558437">The second was when he had the gun in Clarence Music's yard and waved it at him.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.746" offset="579753">The third was when they arrested him, when the police officers arrested him at Gary Music's house and saw the gun in his back pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.272" offset="613921">There are a few other critical facts to this case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.125" offset="629281">Mr. Ball is now in prison, where he has been for the last 15 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.489" offset="646731">He is serving a three-year sentence on the 922 receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.063" offset="668987">At the same time, he is on probation for the 1202 conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.948" offset="696573">He has two years' probation, and he is fully subject to the conditions of that probation at the time that he is in prison now serving those three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.874" offset="740250">This is under the case of Burns against the United States, which is a case we have not cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.170" offset="769507">The citation to it is 287 US 216.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.261" offset="785807">Any time between now and the next nine months, if Mr. Ball should get into any sort of confrontation there in the prison or any trouble at all, if he should infringe upon any prison regulation at all, he is subject to having his probation revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.497" offset="874728">At whatever time he has that probation revoked, he is then subject to having an extra two years imposed upon him, two years that he will have to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.663" offset="919450">That, of course, will be concurrent with the sentence that he is now serving, but it will still mean to him that after he has served his three years on the 922 offense, he will yet have one more year or at least up to one more year, somewhere between three months and one year, of a sentence to serve because of the 1202 concurrent sentence that is now imposed upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.160" offset="1021432">In other words, he is worse off today because he has a probation to serve than he would be if he simply had two years to serve on that sentence and it was running concurrently, because if he had two years to serve, it would be over in two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.323" offset="1098023">However, now we have no certainty that it will be over in two years, and we have no certainty for the next nine months.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.247" offset="1129787">We say that this is not an adverse collateral consequence of this concurrent sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.861" offset="1152253">We say that this is a direct, immediate consequent to Mr. Ball that he is suffering under today, and therefore this case ought to be reviewed.</text>

            <text syncTime="284.681" offset="1259459">That was the opening sentence in our brief, and we also asked in our notice of appeal that... our notice of appeal was taken from the judgment of the District Court, including the finding of guilty and also the sentence that was imposed upon each of these... on each of these two convictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.535" offset="1350888">The question is, what arguments did you make to that court?</text>
            <text syncTime="309.866" offset="1360292">Were they the same as you are making to us?</text>

            <text syncTime="311.997" offset="1368756">Yes, Your Honor, they were exactly the same as we are making hare.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.889" offset="1380354">The only difference is, we left out the two words "and convictions", and the reason we did that was because under the Burton case we suffered some great danger that we would not be heard at all, as Burton had not been heard on his direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.231" offset="1437719">Nevertheless our arguments here are exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.770" offset="1451825">We are still arguing Blockburger and we are still arguing Batchelder, which we argued in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.906" offset="1480455">The Batchelder case we did not argue specifically in the Court of Appeals, but this was because we were faced with the Burton construction of the Batchelder case.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.903" offset="1516400">Burton had already decided what Batchelder meant for the Fourth Circuit, so we were locked into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.347" offset="1542209">The facts here are indistinguishable from the case of Batchelder.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.471" offset="1570630">There a convincted felon bought a gun from an ATF agent while Mr. Batchelder was tending bar in Bellview, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.039" offset="1612948">When he... and the Court said in Batchelder that when Mr. Batchelder reached across that bar and took that gun from the ATF agent, at that moment he was guilty of both.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.377" offset="1670313">He was guilty of 922, receipt, and he was guilty of 1202 just by that single act.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.701" offset="1695600">Here we have the exact same facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.693" offset="1707512">When Mr. Ball reached into that bag of beer, he was guilty of both receipt and possession by that act, and Batchelder said that Congress had intended in passing these two statutes to have two independent statutes each fully enforceable on their own terms, and Batchelder also confirmed that this very conduct violated both statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.340" offset="1806150">When a single act violates two statutes, as we have in this case, we look to... the courts always look to the case of Blockburger against the United States to determine whether there is one offense or whether there are two offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.072" offset="1869053">The first question to ask under the Blockburger analysis is, did Congress intend to cumulatively punish for this offense?</text>

            <text syncTime="446.168" offset="1905415">Isn't that really the first and last question?</text>
            <text syncTime="449.080" offset="1917118">I mean, Blockburger was a case of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.061" offset="1929030">The ultimate question in a case like this is just the one you meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.223" offset="1945644">Did Congress intend to cumulatively punish in the circumstance?</text>
            <text syncTime="460.467" offset="1962676">If the answer is yes, the other Blockburger questions are just irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.079" offset="1989112">Yes, Your Honor, I think that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.052" offset="1996948">Blockburger is a statutory construction, but there are some... there is sort of a procedure to go through under Blockburger.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.935" offset="2024534">The first is to look at the statute, as I understand it, the statute and the legislative history, to see what can be gleaned there, and if there is no clear intent indicated either in the legislative history or in the statute itself, then one resorts to the test of Blockburger to determine what Congress's intent was in passing those two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.430" offset="2114499">So, yes, you are correct, as I understand it, that it is a statutory construction problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.284" offset="2137905">The Circuits... the Courts of Appeals that have considered this question, all except the Tenth Circuit say that there is... there was no cumulative punishment intended by Congress when they passed these two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.878" offset="2212302">When I say all of those Circuits that have considered it, that means the Third, the Fifth, the Seventh, the Ninth, the D.C. Circuit, and the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.304" offset="2250023">These Circuits base their analysis, all except the Third, which is underneath a case which the government conceded, but the other Circuits all base their analysis on the Batchelder case, where the Court in Batchelder had said that the government could prosecute on either.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.856" offset="2332256">The Circuits then interpreted this to mean that the government could not prosecute all the way to judgment, to conviction, to sentence on both of those statutes at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.455" offset="2390561">These same Circuits say when the government has not chosen either one or the other but has chosen instead to proceed on both statutes, that the remedy there is to vacate one conviction and one sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.725" offset="2447717">This is all except the Fourth Circuit, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.958" offset="2460570">The Fourth Circuit says that the remedy is to make the sentences run concurrently.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.969" offset="2476661">But even if the Circuits' reasoning is wrong under Batchelder, still looking to the statutes themselves and to the Congressional history, there is no explicit clear statement in any of that indicating that Congress intended to cumulatively punish under these statutes, and the most recent case of Missouri against Hunter teaches us what kind of language should be there if, or we should look for to determine that intent, language such as "in addition to".</text>
            <text syncTime="621.561" offset="2607064">There is no such language in either of these statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2510.639" offset="10163348">Because in order for that clause to provide a remedy, there has to be some... even if there is a deviation from what Congress intended, there still would have to be some kind of a multiple punishment in order for a petitioner, for the petitioner in this case to rely on a clause as supplying some kind of an affirmative remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.234" offset="10253732">I just want to reiterate our argument based on the concurrent sentence doctrine, because we believe that really the principle underlying that doctrine supports our position in this case, because the doctrine really as it is now applied by the Courts of Appeals is based on the notion that a conviction with no adverse consequences will not prejudice a defendant, and therefore the conviction can be affirmed even though it is unreviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.412" offset="10414437">If petitioner is punished in some way by the second conviction, then it conflicts with this notion that there is no prejudice, and therefore could undermine the concurrent sentence doctrine, which we believe is a useful tool used by the Courts of Appeals to avoid reaching issues that don't really have to be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.314" offset="10502000">Unless the Court has any further questions, we urge that the judgment be affirmed.</text>
