            <text syncTime="91.870" offset="500116">This case presents a question about the addition to the tax often referred to colloquially as a penalty for failure to file a tax return on time.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.108" offset="549122">Section 6651(a)-1 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that in case of failure to file any return on the date prescribed therefor, there shall be added to the tax an amount up to a total of 25 percent of the total tax due unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and is not due to willful neglect.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.700" offset="671479">The question here is whether a taxpayer can demonstrate reasonable cause for a late filed return even though that return's late filing is in fact attributable to negligent by citing the fact that he relied on his attorney or other agent to prepare the return for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.492" offset="754653">The facts were not in dispute below and are not very complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.016" offset="776701">The taxpayer here is the executor of an estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.539" offset="790807">Among the duties of an executor, imposed both by relevant state law and by the Revenue Code, is the duty to file a federal estate tax return.</text>

            <text syncTime="184.100" offset="869070">We think the same reasoning would apply to an income tax return, a gift tax return, almost any kind of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.884" offset="892266">Here the executor hired a lawyer to take care of administering most of the estate's affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.258" offset="913687">The executor met with the lawyer; he was told that the estate would in fact be required to file a federal estate tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.455" offset="946497">The executor was also told that there existed a specific deadline by which the return would have to be filed--</text>
            <text syncTime="210.889" offset="976276">The lawyer in fact knew what that correct deadline was, namely, a date nine months after the date of death, but the lawyer did not recall having informed the executor of the exact due date, only that there was a due date.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.159" offset="1037298">As it turned out, the lawyer, through carelessness, forgot all about the return until well after the filing period had elapsed.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.927" offset="1092364">The Commissioner determined that the executor's late filing was not due to reasonable cause, and accordingly, asserted an addition to the estate tax in the appropriate amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.496" offset="1142624">The Court of Appeals expunged the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.289" offset="1157879">It recognized that under longstanding Treasury regulations, the determination of reasonable cause is governed by an objective test, that is, whether the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care and prudence and was nevertheless unable to file the return within the prescribed time.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.293" offset="1241889">But the Court of Appeals held that here the executor's late filing was due to reasonable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.738" offset="1275639">It relied primarily on two facts, the fact that the executor lacked personal knowledge of the filing date, and that he relied on his attorney to prepare the return for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.836" offset="1327989">The Court of Appeals acknowledged that three other circuits had ruled as a matter of law that reliance on counsel standing alone is not a defense to the late filing penalty in this kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.775" offset="1379816">We think the Court of Appeals was wrong both for reasons of technical tax law and also for reasons of common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.471" offset="1414611">We start from the premise that where, as here, it is clear that a tax return is required to be filed, the taxpayer has a personal and nondelegable duty to file that return on time.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.670" offset="1479394">This premise we think follows from a variety of code provisions that state that the taxpayer shall make a return, he shall sign the return under penalties of perjury, and that he shall file it by a specified date.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.070" offset="1540939">The personal and nondelegable nature of his timely filing obligation has been recognized by almost every lower federal court to address the question, and we think from this premise two conclusions inevitably follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.862" offset="1604155">First of all, because the taxpayer's duty to file on time is personal, he has a concomitant duty personally to find out what the filing date is, and that we think is just a matter of common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.261" offset="1661729">If a person knows he has a duty to perform and knows it must be performed by a deadline, ordinary business care and prudence require him, plainly require him to find out what that date is.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.857" offset="1892129">And secondly, because the taxpayer's duty to file on time is nondelegable, he cannot escape liability for a late filing simply by having somebody else prepare the return for him; rather, if the taxpayer is going to show ordinary business care and prudence, he has got to supervise his agent and make sure the agent gets about the business of preparing the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.676" offset="1995365">Moreover, if the agent is negligent himself, that negligence, we think, under agency doctrine, must be imputed to the taxpayer as the principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.222" offset="2037579">And we think if the Court agrees with us about these general rules in the area, reversal of the Court of Appeals decision is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.619" offset="2071120">Here, the executor knew that he had to file a return; he knew he had to file it by a certain date; but he simply failed to find out what that date was.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.404" offset="2110304">He also failed to use the kind of care that an ordinarily prudent businessman who faced a liability would use in making sure that his agent was prompt in preparing the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.833" offset="2160041">I think in both those respects the taxpayer was negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.183" offset="2177386">Moreover, the attorney was plainly negligent because he forgot about the return altogether, and that negligence must be imputed to the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.870" offset="2208106">And since both of them were negligent, we think that there was no reasonable cause and the penalty was properly assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.753" offset="2235692">This result, we think, is not only dictated by well-settled tax principles, but makes perfect sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1082.368" offset="4462160">Here, what the Court of Appeals held is that the IRS cannot collect from the taxpayer because he relies on the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.425" offset="4494343">It can't collect from the agent because the agent, not being a taxpayer, can't be liable for the addition to the tax, and the result is the IRS can collect from no one, even though it is plain in that precisely what Congress spoke of in the penalty provision, a filing not due to reasonable cause, it is late, has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.976" offset="4572606">And we think this outcome just makes no sense, as a matter of statutory construction or tax policy or common sense or even fairness to the parties involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.914" offset="4612312">Congress designed the late filing addition to the tax as an incentive to timely payment of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.188" offset="4641465">It is designed to protect the revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.560" offset="4654944">Now, the effect of this incentive will be destroyed if a taxpayer can escape liability for a negligent late filing merely by having somebody else prepare his return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.487" offset="4698621">Indeed, the harmful effect of that kind of holding is clear because literally tens of millions of American citizens how have income tax returns prepared by professional return preparers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3357.390" offset="13562281">What happened here is the estate paid the penalty and filed a suit for a refund, for $17,000, about.</text>

            <text syncTime="3510.540" offset="14174800">Finally, I would like to point out that if the Court were to construe the statute as making the penalty applicable only where there is willful neglect, it would be an impossible enforcement burden on the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.587" offset="14223074">Thousands of returns are filed late every year, and if we had to prove on a case by case basis whether or not the taxpayer or his agent acted willfully, it would be a nightmare for the courts and for the IRS.</text>
