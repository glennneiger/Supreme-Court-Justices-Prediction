            <text syncTime="107.254" offset="571807">To discuss the facts of Petitioner's case is to highlight the Double Jeopardy violations which Petitioner suffered due to the government's improper successive prosecution and cumulative punishment of him for the same conduct for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.027" offset="638889">Petitioner was indicted in March 1981 in the Western District of Washington with three of the four counts of that indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.571" offset="677132">Count II charged Petitioner with causing an informant, Joseph Knowles, to travel in interstate commerce from Panama City, Florida, the ultimate place where Petitioner was then indicted in a second indictment to go to Seattle, Washington, for the purposes of engaging in a marijuana offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.892" offset="754350">Count III charged Petitioner with importing 12,000 pounds of marijuana into Neah Bay, Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.201" offset="783607">That occurred in August of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.450" offset="796669">Count IV charged Petitioner with possession with intent to distribute that same marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.401" offset="816417">Petitioner was not charged in Count I of that indictment which alleged a conspiracy to import marijuana which occurred from September 1979 through August of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.005" offset="866886">He was, however, named as a co-conspirator involved in that activity which involved witnesses and evidence from the Northern District of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.875" offset="910354">At one of Petitioner's first bail hearings in Washington State, the government prosecutor, the Assistant United States Attorney who was in charge of the prosecution of Petitioner, advised the District Court that the Department of Justice in Washington had originally authorized Petitioner's indictment in Washington State on a continuing criminal enterprise charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.428" offset="1008574">However, he advised the court, instead that continuing criminal enterprise charge was being considered by the Northern District of Florida Grand Jury and not by his grand jury in Seattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.736" offset="1057789">Petitioner at that hearing on April 8th immediately asked that the continuing criminal enterprise charge be joined in Washington State to be tried with the other indictment then pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.059" offset="1111078">The government attorney represented, as an officer of the court, that Petitioner had been responsible for a continuing criminal enterprise, and the grand jury... presumably he meant the grand jury in Seattle Washington... would have returned an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.319" offset="1172100">The government told the court: This coordinated investigation from Washington, D.C., showed Petitioner's involvement in four or five 1977 through 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.063" offset="1227062">During the next two weeks after these statements from the government prosecutor, Petitioner filed two motions of note to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.122" offset="1259349">First was a motion for bill of particulars, as Petitioner alleged in his moving papers, so that he could be protected against a second prosecution, and so that he might plead Double Jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.773" offset="1305952">Petitioner, more importantly, filed a motion to compel consolidation of any continuing criminal enterprise charge so that that continuing criminal enterprise charge would be tried in Washington State.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.753" offset="1357883">In Petitioner's motion, he alleged that the government prosecutor had stated that his directives... that is, the government prosecutor's directives... from the Justice Department were to omit the continuing criminal enterprise charge in the Washington State indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.167" offset="1427474">Petitioner alleged that the government was manipulating venue for the CCE prosecution where a more favorable prosecution and seeking to enhance any subsequent sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.991" offset="1474807">Petitioner alleged that the prosecutor had advised him... that is, Petitioner's counsel... that the prosecutor had been prepared to try the defendant for the continuing criminal enterprise charge, but was instructed by the Justice Department not to seek that indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.188" offset="1539591">Petitioner moved in this motion, which is in the Joint Appendix, for a number of grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.279" offset="1563937">Number one, to defend all charges in the same trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.683" offset="1577521">Number two, to have the case transferred to another district due to his financial hardship in defending in two separate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.009" offset="1606883">Three, to join the offenses in one proceeding; to seek a single trial of both indictments; that venue was proper on the CCE charge in Washington State; that the charges in Washington and Florida were the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.127" offset="1671353">The government's response was that since there were no other charges pending, there were no charges to consolidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.921" offset="1698520">On May 18th of that year, Petitioner pleaded guilty in Washington to Count III, the importation of marijuana count.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.402" offset="1728404">Sixty days later on July 16th, Petitioner was indicted in the Northern District of Florida for the continuing criminal enterprise, also a conspiracy ranging from January 1976 to July 16, 1981, to import marijuana and "Thai sticks", a conspiracy also on the same dates to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, and four telephone counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.283" offset="1831954">The Thai sticks, incidentally, do not occur except in the indictment with relation to the Neah Bay, Washington, episode.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.671" offset="1865495">There are no Thai sticks alleged to have occurred in any other episode involving Petitioner except in the Neah Bay, Washington, episode.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.511" offset="1892871">On August 20, Petitioner was sentenced in Washington State on his importation plea to the maximum five years and $15,000 fine and a three-year special parole term.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.819" offset="1942086">In Florida... back again... on September 23rd, Petitioner moved to dismiss the CCE and the conspiracy counts, claiming he was being twice prosecuted for the same offense in violation of the Double Jeopardy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.563" offset="2001123">The District Court denied the motion to dismiss, holding that a conspiracy and a substantive offense can be prosecuted separately since they are separate crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.090" offset="2039157">Using some of the very same evidence it had used to convict Petitioner in Washington State, he was convicted of both conspiracies, a telephone count, and the continuing criminal enterprise charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="522.150" offset="2231418">However, the evidence which was developed in Washington was certainly introduced... 12,000 pounds' worth of photographs of Thai sticks on the beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.318" offset="2268094">The other material, three or four witnesses from Seattle, Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.785" offset="2294007">They flew a chemist in from Honolulu specifically to identify a Thai stick as a form of marijuana.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.108" offset="2627225">And the District Court sent a note back in the affirmative indicating that it could consider the Neah Bay information.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="1466.598" offset="6009247">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.611" offset="6033279">Let me begin by saying that in our view this case doesn't involve any segmenting or unit of prosecution issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.234" offset="6055745">That issue would come up if the government had sought to take a single continuing criminal enterprise and divide it for purposes of prosecution and sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.620" offset="6089286">That is not what is done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.041" offset="6095033">The unit of prosecution issue, first of all, would be an issue of statutory intent, not a Double Jeopardy issue at all, and the only issue that Petitioner has raised is a Double Jeopardy issue, not a unit of prosecution issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.693" offset="6149576">So let me turn to the Double Jeopardy question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.364" offset="6160234">The Double Jeopardy clause prohibits successive prosecutions for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.345" offset="6184163">Now under this principle, Petitioner does not dispute that he was subject to successive prosecutions for his various substantive drug offenses, no matter how many there were, no matter where around the country they were brought, no matter what the evidence might have been that the government actually used in each of those prosecutions; nor does he dispute that he was subject to successive prosecutions for substantive offenses and for conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.445" offset="6280607">So that, as he conceded just a moment ago, he could have been tried on substantive offenses and a conspiracy offense could later have been brought in Florida, and a conspiracy offense could have used much or all of the same evidence that the government had previously relied on in the substantive prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.095" offset="6339225">He also does not dispute that he was subject to a CCE prosecution in Florida following the Washington importation prosecution, provided only that the Washington importation was not used as part of the government's proof of the series of drug violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.634" offset="6413309">So the issue in this case, therefore--</text>

            <text syncTime="1580.458" offset="6464613">But the central question here is whether importation of marijuana and continuing criminal enterprise become the same offense because that importation is used in a given case as one of the predicates for CCE.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.951" offset="6526680">Now we submit the Petitioner's importation of marijuana in Washington on August 26th, 1980, was not the same offense as his continuing criminal enterprise that occurred around the country in at least eight states that lasted for more than half a decade and that involved numerous criminal activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.221" offset="6811728">So we have two levels of argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1687.182" offset="6891558">There is indeed no taint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.479" offset="6896783">As Petitioner conceded, he could be prosecuted in Florida for conspiracy, and the Neah Bay evidence could be admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.071" offset="6923114">And the conspiracy, he also admits, could be used as one of the predicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.678" offset="6937534">So we think there is no taint from the use of the Neah Bay evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.692" offset="6953625">Now before turning to the analytical framework for resolving the Double Jeopardy issue, let me first discuss briefly some of the consequences of Petitioner's argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1786.002" offset="7286843">I think that it would have very unsound application in the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.172" offset="7311503">Let me give another example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.139" offset="7315369">That is a case like the First Circuit's decision in Middleton upon which Petitioner relies, where the CCE prosecution is brought first and the defendant is acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.699" offset="7349642">Suppose it is clear that the reason for the CCE acquittal is that five or more other people were involved but that the defendant did not obtain substantial income or resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.695" offset="7389557">Under Petitioner's theory, the defendant would be immune from a substantive prosecution even though the government's evidence was ample to show, as one of the CCE predicates, the defendant committed that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.252" offset="7439816">These would lead to very substantial windfalls for drug defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.736" offset="7453818">Now what arguments have been advanced to support those windfalls?</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.218" offset="7471686">Basically there are two: the Blockburger test, and the same-facts test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.576" offset="7489136">Let me start with Blockburger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.653" offset="7497390">Blockburger was designed to determine whether violations of two statutory provisions arising from the same act or transaction are the same offense in the sense of having a certain logical and necessary relation to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.303" offset="7560084">That is, whether the elements of one are identical to or entirely subsumed in the elements of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.721" offset="7589759">So that whenever the government establishes one offense, it always necessarily and invariably establishes that other offense as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.827" offset="7626122">This Blockburger relation identifies the offenses as true greater and lesser included offenses, and thus has the same offense for Double Jeopardy purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.152" offset="7667395">Now Blockburger is simply unhelpful in analyzing the quite different issue of the relation between a compound offense such as CCE or RICO and its underlying predicate offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.771" offset="7717864">The offenses used as the multiple predicates for CCE are not lesser included offenses, because no particular or specific offense is a necessary component of the compound CCE offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.155" offset="7775438">Rather, any of a number of offenses can serve as predicates, and the actual predicates will vary from case to case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.652" offset="7809397">Moreover, CCE and its predicates do not involve the same act or transaction: rather, they arise from an extensive course of criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.617" offset="7857253">In this case, for example, Petitioner's continuing criminal enterprise occurred over a five-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.862" offset="7882226">It extended to at least eight different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.940" offset="7890585">It included numerous participants, and involved myriad criminal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.095" offset="7915245">Now in these circumstances, application of the Blockburger standard is irresolvably indeterminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.888" offset="7942412">It tells us nothing about the relation between the compound offense and the predicate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.839" offset="7966132">We believe Blockburger is not an end in itself, but instead is a means of sound analysis for the same offense question, and it has no applicability--</text>

            <text syncTime="2432.558" offset="9873070">--I'm not entirely sure, and the Court did not explain it, but I think the best reading is that the Court couldn't come to a conclusive determination of the Double Jeopardy claim, because that claim turned on the nature of the state law offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.115" offset="9923330">That is, whether manslaughter with an automobile was intended by the legislature to be an aggravated form of the traffic offense where a death ensued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.955" offset="9958647">If the Illinois legislature intended that manslaughter was an aggravated form of failure to slow where death ensued, then a defendant would have not just a substantial claim of Double Jeopardy but a conclusive claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.169" offset="10003474">But the Court was unable to determine that because the issue hadn't been briefed and decided by the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.917" offset="10026461">So I think the Court's use of the word "substantial" indicated that there was a basis for the claim, but that the case in its present posture couldn't be finally resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.007" offset="10062824">We think that is also clear from the Court's discussion of the felony murder decision... the Court's discussion in Vitalle of the felony murder decision in Harris against Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.112" offset="10107232">The Court in Vitalle stated that Harris had viewed the felony murder... had viewed killing in the course of a robbery as a separate statutory offense, and that the robbery was a lesser included offense thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.841" offset="10166164">In other words, the Court viewed the issue in Harris as felony murder being an aggravated form of the underlying felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.650" offset="10197407">That would make them the same offense for Double Jeopardy purposes, and the Court's view of the felony murder statute that we think underlies this decision in Harris is the same view it later took of the District of Columbia felony murder statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.332" offset="10252159">That is, that is was an aggravated form of the underlying felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.065" offset="10267101">Nothing in these decisions turns on the facts or evidence in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.141" offset="10291343">We think there is no basis for Petitioner's advancing a same-facts' test for Double Jeopardy purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.810" offset="10318092">Now if Blockburger and the same-facts' test are not the proper standards what is the correct approach in this area for complex compound-predicate offenses like CCE and RICO?</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.055" offset="10363023">We submit that the same-offense question can be answered only by a focused and concrete examination of the offenses that Congress has created.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.802" offset="10401998">The Double Jeopardy clause recognizes that it is the province of Congress to prescribe criminal offenses, and it does not limit the offenses that Congress can define.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.859" offset="10442226">The decisive question, therefore, is did Congress create separate offenses?</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.248" offset="10463856">Now in effect, this is what the Blockburger test determines in the area in which it is applicable to true greater and lesser included offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.479" offset="10500740">Where Blockburger is not satisfied, not simply that it can't be applied, but where it can be applied and is not satisfied, it cannot be said that the offenses are different in any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.616" offset="10545253">Blockburger thus serves as a shorthand or a proxy in some situations for evaluating whether the legislatively defined offenses are the same or different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.969" offset="10594677">Now the same fundamental inquiry applies for more complex statutory provisions that do not involve true greater and lesser included offenses such as CCE or RICO.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.934" offset="10638563">But there, the mechanistic Blockburger test cannot be used as a surrogate for a careful examination of the nature of the offenses defined by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.772" offset="10689867">This required examination turns on the text of the statutes, their legislative history, their common law or statutory background, the societal interests and legislative policies that underlie them, and any other considerations that inform the inquiry into the character and substance of the offenses that Congress has prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.326" offset="10772100">Now applying that standard here, we believe it is clear that Congress did not create CCE and the marijuana importation offense as the same offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3200.513" offset="12944861">Let me briefly state why.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.670" offset="12949459">The conspiracy in Jeffers was not one of the predicates for the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.262" offset="12963878">Rather, the Court, making its assumption about the in-concert element being conspiratorial agreement, essentially concluded that the conspiracy in Jeffers was a true lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.086" offset="13007137">That is, whenever the government establishes CCE, it will always and necessarily establish that kind of a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.535" offset="13040992">Given that view, the Court came to the conclusion that successive prosecutions constituted Double Jeopardy for the same offense, and the Congress did not intend to authorize cumulative penalties for true greater and lesser included offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.326" offset="13104104">Whatever the correctness of that decision, it simply does not apply to the fundamentally different issue in this case: whether CCE and substantive offenses are the same not because they are true greater and lesser included offenses, but because in a given case the substantive offense is used as a predicate for the compound CCE offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.412" offset="13180486">We think that is a fundamentally different issue, and that in light of the language, the history, and importantly the purposes of the kingpin statute, CCE and the substantive of predicates are not the same offense.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip A. DeMassa</label>
            <text syncTime="3274.984" offset="13242762">The Solicitor General indicates that Jeffers conspiracy is not one of the predicates of the prosecution in Jeffers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.230" offset="13279751">If that were so, then they would be separate offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.026" offset="13290932">If that were so, there would be no necessity to have a lesser included offense instruction as was indicated by Justice Blackmun in his decision that lesser included offenses instructions would be warranted in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.879" offset="13346311">There was a citation of Kiebel, and there were other citations after Kiebel from Jeffers which indicate that you don't just look at the statutory elements of the crime to determine whether or not a lesser included offense instruction is warranted, but you look at whether or not the evidence warrants those instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.604" offset="13433247">Two of those cases are Beck vs. Alabama, and Hopper vs. Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.822" offset="13450069">Those cases indicate that you look at the underlying facts to determine whether or not a lesser included offense instruction is warranted in a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.178" offset="13483506">It's clear in this case that if the evidence is relied upon by the prosecution to prove the greater offense, the continuing criminal enterprise charge, and it's warranted by the evidence, that if lesser included offense instructions are warranted, then they must be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.344" offset="13548185">That does not make a CCE a separate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.514" offset="13564904">You cannot have a CCE offense without having its necessarily included lesser offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.697" offset="13593638">Now those lesser offenses are felonies, that's to be sure, in this case; they're not misdemeanors as you normally find in statutes; but because of the punishment aspect of CCE, you get a tremendous lever with this type of punishment over a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.597" offset="13657168">In this case, 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.581" offset="13665109">No parole, no probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.738" offset="13673782">If Congress, as Congress intended and did, intended to proscribe against the business of drug dealing, then this type of statute with its underlying felonies is necessary in order to prove that greater statutory violation, you need to prove the lesser included offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.714" offset="13745671">In this case, you can tell from just the initial indictment in Seattle when Petitioner was not charged with a conspiracy in Seattle, that the government clearly knew that it was one offense that they were prosecuting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.959" offset="13794677">He was not charged in Count I of that conspiracy because, frankly, the government read Jeffers several years later after Jeffers came out and concluded that CCE was a conspiracy offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.143" offset="13839398">And because other circuit courts have been stating that 846 and 963 are conspiracies, and therefore since Jeffers says 848 is a conspiracy offense, we're not going to allege conspiracies involving the same indictment for the same conduct because the defendant would plead to the conspiracy and buy the 848 charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3450.334" offset="13944202">Because, in order to have an habitual offender statute or a recedivist statute, you are putting an offender who is offending more than once on notice by his prior convictions for nonrelated offenses that his subsequent act and subsequent conduct in a new offense unrelated to his prior offenses is going to cumulatively punish him, is going to greater punish him for the new offense.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip A. DeMassa</label>
            <text syncTime="3493.895" offset="14118386">Well, the cases cited by the government in the recidivist area clearly indicate that the purpose for recidivist statutes are, once a person has been burned once, he is on notice that he can't continue that conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.311" offset="14172094">But there's no burning once in a CCE indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.951" offset="14182647">There's no conviction... three convictions, and then you're out of the ballgame; three convictions, and now you're a CCE defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.762" offset="14205844">You've got to commit these over a continuing period of time, not just once.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.680" offset="14221518">In any event, the habitual offenders I think are analogized the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.506" offset="14244819">There's just no comparison between those and a CCE offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.568" offset="14261119">By the way, if the government's impression regarding Jeffers and the lesser included offenses was correct, then Iannelli would control the case, as Mr. Justice White ruled or held in the Jeffers case, and that's clearly not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.437" offset="14324545">You cannot make the greater offense without the lesser included offenses also being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.295" offset="14348055">Therefore, they are necessarily included, and the evidence would warrant them being held that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.916" offset="14374491">The Illinois vs. Vitalle, the government argues that there is not a same-transaction test, but what happened in that case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.599" offset="14409181">The Court basically looked at the facts of the case to determine whether or not there was a substantial claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.176" offset="14427572">It was remanded to the Illinois courts for a determination of whether or not failure to slow was a lesser included offense or necessarily required to prove the greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.297" offset="14468009">It's the same situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.093" offset="14475219">Again, you get back to the continuum of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.249" offset="14483787">It's a continuing substantive violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.950" offset="14494654">By segmenting out Petitioner's conduct in Washington when the government knew it was going to prosecute Petitioner in Florida for the same offense, they committed all those violations of the Double Jeopardy Clause which Petitioner had a right to be protected from, including a right to be protected from cumulative punishment for the same conduct.</text>
