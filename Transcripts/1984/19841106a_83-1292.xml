            <text syncTime="324.488" offset="1429967">But the fact of the case is, as the District Court found, and it was not reversed by the Ninth Circuit, that the government itself had not pursued available alternative methods, that in February of 1982, the government in a volume called Increasing Selective Service Compliance, had examined other alternatives besides the passive enforcement system, had found them viable, reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.926" offset="1543756">In March of 1982, eight months after the government states to this Court that it was interested in another policy, a memo was drafted from the Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division to his counterpart in the Selective Service Department which said, the purpose of this memo is to explore whether or not we shall address, whether or not we shall establish an active enforcement system.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.752" offset="1707074">And Mr. Klein's response, at 798 and at 803 of the record, was that he wanted to push the decisionmakers, he wanted to push Selective Service to the maximum extent possible to establish an active enforcement system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.425" offset="6585702">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I want to correct any misimpression that might exist as to the facts of this case, particularly how this program operated, some of the problems that the government raised, and how it went about solving them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.974" offset="6643903">I do so against the background of the well established principle that the selection of prosecutorial choices lies at the heart of the executive responsibility to see that the laws are faithfully executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.503" offset="6698029">The issue in this case is not whether someone else can see another way that the government might have gone about its responsibility to enforce the draft registration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.990" offset="6735959">Basically there were three options that were available to the government, and all three were considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.244" offset="6752990">The three were, first, sometimes called the active method, was to identify the entire universe of persons who were required to register, match those against those who had registered, and then make a random selection out of the difference between those two groups, who would be the nonregistrants, and prosecute those who were randomly selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.020" offset="6844106">The second option, which is sometimes referred to as the passive method, was narrower in scope and less expensive, would have been simply to prosecute those who the government knew were violators from information that had been supplied either by them or by someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.230" offset="6908994">What the government in fact elected was to develop an active system, knew that it would take some time to develop the active system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.476" offset="6937937">In fact, it took longer than the government anticipated it would take to develop it, with a passive program in effect during the interim while the active method was being developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.363" offset="6993526">Mr. Rosenbaum is just quite wrong when he says that the active system, that there was undue delay in developing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.408" offset="7017663">As set forth at Page 7 of our brief, there was a computer program that had been developed and was ready to go as early as March of 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.920" offset="7075759">One of the petitioner's main errors, I submit, is his assertion that during this passive phase interim, the event which triggered further prosecution was criticism or dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.740" offset="7126959">The uncontradicted evidence in this record, which is discussed at Page 13 of our brief, shows that in fact the trigger was evidence of nonregistration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.606" offset="7166457">No matter how vehement the letter of protest, no matter how many speeches the individual gave, that activity would result in further investigation only if it included the one thing, the only thing that the government was looking for, and that was some evidence of the sole piece of information which the government was interested in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1891.105" offset="7696429">There is nothing in the record that would shed any light on that one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.898" offset="7715655">Now, once Selective Service got its pool of names, the first thing that Selective Service did was to send one of these registration in lieu of prosecution letters, and from that initial screening process the number was narrowed down to about 133.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.172" offset="7808755">Those were then sent to the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Attorney would send at least one letter advising once again of the registration in lieu of prosecution alternative, and then in most cases, including the petitioner Wayte, there was also a visit from an FBI agent advising him finally of this so-called beg policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.218" offset="7904886">Now, it is not surprising under these circumstances that the only person who would be prosecuted as a result of this process would be protesters, but the only reason that it is not surprising is because the government went the extra mile to attempt to implement what has been its policy throughout, as we argued last April in the Selective Service case, and that is not to put people in jail, but to get them registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.827" offset="8015332">It would be the ultimate irony if the fact that we were willing to go that extra mile to get people registered instead of put in jail would result in the entire process being held unconstitutional, and yet that is the only argument that the petitioner has, is this kind of ultimate effects test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.711" offset="8090878">I submit that the key to decision in this case is to make a clean distinction between two separate activities, criticism of the draft and registration for the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.219" offset="8140928">Criticism is constitutionally protected and any governmental impingement on it can be sustained only if it satisfies the requirements that this Court has identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.896" offset="8179590">Nonregistration, by contrast, enjoys no constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.717" offset="8194950">Governmental burdens on a person's desire not to register are irrelevant to the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.020" offset="8216161">No one in this courtroom disputes that David Wayte has violated the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.525" offset="8234133">He is legally obligated to register for the draft, and in refusing to do so he has committed a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.338" offset="8257435">So that the only question is whether there is something about the fact that the government has prosecuted only him and a few others like him, but not all, that precludes the government from calling this petitioner to account for his acknowledged violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.118" offset="8320546">Now, I must confess that I am confused concerning just what the petitioner's position is with respect to selective prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.713" offset="8358894">It is not one of the questions presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.256" offset="8373105">I do not find it argued in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.909" offset="8387733">Nevertheless, in our view, it is the only legitimate constitutional question that is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.022" offset="8408109">We think this is not a legitimate First Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.185" offset="8424827">I will discuss briefly first the selective prosecution issue, and then the First Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.718" offset="8446875">Building on this Court's statements in Cyler versus Boles and other cases, the Courts of Appeals have adopted a two-part test with which, so far as I can determine, no court disagrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.194" offset="8488775">It has never been formally adopted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.308" offset="8497239">We would urge its adoption by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.438" offset="8505807">We think it represents just the right balance between, on the one hard, wide room for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion that this Court has frequently said the government must have, and on the other hand, preserving the opportunity for a legitimate showing of improper selection in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.311" offset="8577278">It is a two-part test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.000" offset="8584070">First, the defendant must show that he was chosen for prosecution, although others similarly situated were not, and second, he must show that the prosecutor intentionally discriminated against him on the basis of some impermissible consideration such as race, religion, or the exercise of a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.823" offset="8659302">It is that second prong of the selective prosecution test that gives adequate opportunity, adequate protection for the exercise of First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.230" offset="8704964">Briefly, with respect to the first prong, petitioner simply has not shown that others similarly situated have not been prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.386" offset="8733595">This case is different insofar as similarly situated is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.819" offset="8755328">Justice Rehnquist asked the question, have there been other circumstances where people have announced their protest and then been prosecuted, and the answer is yes, there have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.626" offset="8794512">Tax protester cases are such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.378" offset="8805588">The air traffic control strike cases were such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.878" offset="8819590">We have universally won those cases in the lower courts except where the government's conduct has been found to violate the rather broad discretionary standards that are given by this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.998" offset="8872043">But this case is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.759" offset="8879044">This is simply not a hard selective prosecution case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.702" offset="8894822">And the reason this case is different from the tax protester case and the air traffic controller case is in both of which contexts our conduct has been upheld because of the fact that we get the most, if you will, bang for the buck out of prosecuting the most vocal protesters, is that in this instance we prosecuted everyone similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.307" offset="8981235">Now, in the nature of things, we cannot prosecute those who we do not know have violated the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.472" offset="9017911">And at the end of this screening process, there were only eventually 17 people, 13 as of the time of the trial in this case, whom we knew had violated the law, and we prosecuted every one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.041" offset="9076217">There was absolutely no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.473" offset="9085934">With regard to the second prong, I simply submit that there was no violation, that the Court of Appeals finding is correct, and in any event, that there has not been any violation of the First Amendment of any kind, and it is to that issue that I now turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.075" offset="9156360">The petitioner's contention that his prosecution violates the First Amendment depends totally on the significance that he ascribes to the fact that all of the men who have been prosecuted had one thing in common.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.183" offset="9204739">They had all expressed opposition to the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.015" offset="9216128">In fact, however, those who were prosecuted also have a second thing in common, and that is as to each of them we knew who they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.389" offset="9249565">Two facts, both uncontroverted, make it very clear that it was the second of these common denominators and not the first that constituted, to use the petitioner's term, the trip wire for prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.680" offset="9310796">The first is that during the passive phase interim, which incidentally lasted about 15 months, the event which placed a young man on the list for further investigation was his criticism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.959" offset="9367848">No matter how vehement the protest, no matter how extensive the protest, it was only if he included that one magic sentence that got him initially into the pool of somewhat over 1,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.526" offset="9414137">And the second fact is that he could quickly get himself off that list by his own selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.301" offset="9441199">This was not, if you will, selective prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.794" offset="9455201">This was elective prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.026" offset="9468158">The so-called beg policy is relevant not only because it sheds light on the government's objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.160" offset="9504729">It also draws the clean distinction between the two factors that must be distinguished in this case, registration on the one hand and protest on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.319" offset="9553317">Regardless of what the individual might have done in the past, he is free both to register for the draft, as everyone concedes he is legally obligated to do, and also continue to protest, so long as he registers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.708" offset="9610891">Late registrants who spoke against the draft were not prosecuted, and prosecutions were brought against every identified nonregistrant who refused to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.475" offset="9649970">Just one final point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.316" offset="9657284">Even if this were a First Amendment case, even if you could get by the First Amendment threshold, in this instance, there is no suppression of speech, incidental or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.448" offset="9725830">For reasons discussed in our brief, we believe that the relevant First Amendment inquiry is stated by this Court in United States versus O'Brien 16 years ago, and reaffirmed twice just last term in the Jaycees case and in the CCNV Sleeping in the Park case, that incidental restraints on First Amendment interests are permissible so long as what government is attempting to do is, and I am quoting from both Roberts and the Sleeping in the Park case,</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.815" offset="9831260">"unrelated to the suppression of expression. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.018" offset="9844112">In this case, there is no suppression speech, incidental or otherwise, and the reason is that these two activities, registration and protest, can exist side by side, contrasted in that respect with the Jaycees case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.617" offset="9910463">The attainment of Minnesota's antidiscrimination objective as expressed in its statute necessarily affected the associational interests of the Jaycees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.093" offset="9952468">Either Minnesota's interest in combatting discrimination or the Jaycees' associational interest had to yield, and that is what brings about a First Amendment problem, when one of them necessarily has to yield to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.987" offset="10019968">The same was true in Sleeping in the Park.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.777" offset="10027178">The same was true in O'Brien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.409" offset="10033657">And I submit that the same is true in every other legitimate First Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.191" offset="10052778">The feature of true First Amendment cases that brings the First Amendment into play is the fact that the very act of accomplishing the governmental objective necessarily affects First Amendment activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.466" offset="10093947">But here, so long as the protester complies with the legal duty which even he does not dispute, he is free to criticize, and even if he does not register, he is free to criticize.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.125" offset="10144520">He will be prosecuted, but it will not be for not registering, because it did not depend on the substance of anything that was said other than the reporting of a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.342" offset="10189451">So that the only incremental risk, the only component of his speech that puts him at all at risk is that single component of his speech that identifies commission of a crime, and there is nothing in the First Amendment, nothing in the Fifth Amendment, and nothing in the Constitution that protects against the government's use of that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.041" offset="10292164">Unless the Court has further questions, I have nothing else.</text>

            <text syncTime="2548.145" offset="10324661">I want to join issue with General Lee in the sense that what is in fact involved in this case is the relationship between criticism and the registration act itself with respect to the individuals that were singled out by this system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.068" offset="10404282">If this Court finds that there is no relationship that exists there, that in fact all the individuals who were singled out for investigation or prosecution or the majority of them were individuals who were not at the same time expressing a political opposition to the draft registration and in fact expressing it not only through stating their objection but through the additional statement of saying that they were not registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.124" offset="10508563">What General Lee is indicating in his statement is that that statement itself, that I will not register, is both not protected by the First Amendment and additionally that it adds nothing, either in a cognitive sense or in an emotive sense, to the message that is being communicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.077" offset="10576377">It is as if the government wants to extract that statement out and tell David Wayte, you may say to the government, you may say to the government, I oppose this system in an abstract sort of way, but if you go a step further, and if you want to communicate the additional intimate personal message that I believe in that so strongly that I will not register, I will not register for the draft, then an enforcement system will be activated, and that is the only way that this system will be activated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.479" offset="10705944">What General Lee has not denied is that either with respect to the individuals who were prosecuted or the individuals against whom the beg policy was applied, that the only individuals against whom it was applied were those who made some sort of expression of First Amendment activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2921.657" offset="11818656">But the second point is actually a larger point, and more critical here, and that is that unlike the Virginia handgun situation, this government had alternative enforcement systems, alternative enforcement systems that were available, as the District Court found, from the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.652" offset="11898695">And if the government didn't know who these other individuals were at the time it selected David Wayte, it was because it deliberately elected not to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.058" offset="11932236">It deliberately elected not to go after anyone except those individuals who exercised their First Amendment rights.</text>
