            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="137411">We will hear argument first this morning in United States against Miller.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="13.433" offset="191119">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case concerns the degree of correspondence that is required between the proof at trial and the allegations in an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.674" offset="276069">This question is one of great practical importance because lack of correspondence between proof and charges in an indictment is to some extent a feature of a large proportion of criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.544" offset="331553">This is due to two basic factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.058" offset="345555">First of all, as you are well aware, the grand jury has a different standard of proof for returning an indictment from the one the petty jury has at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.539" offset="383484">The indictment need be based only on a showing of probable cause, and, of course, it's entirely possible that a showing of probable cause cannot be elevated into a showing of proof beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.251" offset="434371">Secondly, there are often changes in the availability of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.796" offset="456523">Witnesses may die, disappear, or cease cooperation between the time of indictment and trial, new evidence may come to light and the prosecutor may acquire a reason not to credit some of the evidence that was presented to the grand jury or to feel it's not persuasive enough to justify presenting it to the petty jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.039" offset="529561">Now in this particular case respondent was charged with three counts of mail fraud, and the elements of the offense of mail fraud are, first, the mailing, second, an execution or furtherance of a scheme to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.002" offset="585359">The offense in this indictment was described in right paragraphs, but the essential elements were alleged in the first paragraph and the last paragraph of Count One, which is at pages 2 and 3 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.075" offset="637708">The last paragraph alleges the mailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.386" offset="646903">The first paragraph alleges that respondent did devise and intend to devise a scheme and artifice to defraud and to obtain money by means of false and fraudulent pretenses and representations from Aetna Insurance Company by making a fraudulent insurance claim for a loss due to an alleged burglary at San Francisco Scrap Metal.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.675" offset="724017">The essence of this scheme, then, was to obtain money to which respondent was not entitled by making a false insurance claim in connection with an alleged burglary at his place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.358" offset="774799">Nothing more than paragraph 1 and 8 need have been alleged in this indictment; however, in fact the indictment contained six additional paragraphs, 2 through 7, describing the scheme in more detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.525" offset="827462">Of particular relevance are paragraphs 6 and 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.273" offset="842404">In paragraph 6 it was alleged that it was part of the scheme that defendant well knew that the alleged burglary was committed with his knowledge and consent for the purpose of obtaining the insurance proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.111" offset="885767">In fact, at trial not enough evidence was put on to establish this charge of the grand jury or this description of the scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.123" offset="925891">In paragraph 7 the grand jury alleged that it was a further part of the scheme that the defendant well knew that the amount of copper claimed to have been taken during the alleged burglary was grossly inflated for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining $150,000 from Aetna Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.757" offset="988376">This allegation was proved beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.132" offset="1009901">Now the Court of Appeals reversed respondent's conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.471" offset="1039262">It held that the petty jury convicted Miller, and I am quoting from its opinion at 6(a) of the appendix to the petition,</text>
            <text syncTime="236.295" offset="1082521">"for devising a scheme to defraud Aetna by inflating the amount of the claimed loss, even though the grand jury indicted on the basis of a scheme to defraud consisting not only of the inflated claim but also of Miller's knowing consent to burglary. "</text>
            <text syncTime="249.275" offset="1134453">The Court went on to say that in a mail fraud case the petty jury must find that the defendant participated in the overall scheme alleged by the grand jury because the Court could not be certain that the grand jury would have indicted on the basis that the defendant participated in only a part of the scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.829" offset="1204670">They go on to say that because it is possible that if the grand jury had seen only the proof that the petty jury had seen it would not have chosen to indict; therefore, the conviction should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.182" offset="1278126">Now in this Court respondent relies principally not on this rationale of the Court of Appeals, I think, of speculation about the grand jury, but, rather, on the more direct proposition that the charge and the proof at trial involved essentially different offenses in the sense that the indictment did not really embrace the scheme for which he was convicted and that, therefore, he was deprived of his right to be convicted only on an offense for which he's been indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.401" offset="1415008">Now let me begin my legal argument with a proposition that has generally been treated by this Court as black letter law, and as long ago as 1896 in Crain against the United States, for instance, the Court said</text>
            <text syncTime="334.709" offset="1476239">"we perceive no sound reason why the doing of the prohibited thing in each and all of the prohibited modes may not be charged in one count so that there may be a verdict of guilty upon proof that the accused has done any one of the things constituting a substantive crime under the statute. "</text>
            <text syncTime="352.279" offset="1546456">This same thought has been expressed in a number of decisions of this Court and in innumerable decisions of the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.010" offset="1581355">Now these propositions, this proposition would seem rather clearly to dispose of this case in the government's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.007" offset="1609359">However, the waters are somewhat muddied by the rather extraordinary decision almost a century ago by this Court in a case called Ex Parte Bain.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.801" offset="1648542">Bain was a case in which the defendant, who was an officer of a bank, was indicted for making false statements in the reports of the bank for the purpose of deceiving, and then the indictment charged, for the purpose of deceiving the Comptroller of the Currency and the agent appointed by the Comptroller to inspect the affairs of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.867" offset="1756794">At trial Bain demurred to this indictment on the ground that the statute did not cover deceiving the Comptroller of the Currency, but only his agent, and on this basis the demur was sustained, whereupon, the prosecution, quite reasonably, in my view, said well, let us strike the allegation that the Comptroller of the Currency was deceived and just leave the part of the indictment charging deceit of his agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.575" offset="1867658">This was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.371" offset="1874867">Bain was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.418" offset="1879047">Then, on review in this Court, his conviction was reversed, and it was reversed on a ground very similar to the rationale that the Ninth Circuit employed here; that is, the Court said maybe the grand jury would have elected not to indict had it been presented only with evidence that the agent was deceived and not with what it may have viewed as a more serious matter, deceiving the Comptroller of the Currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.579" offset="1983641">Now Bain is a little bit different from this case because Bain does not involve a failure to prove what was alleged in the indictment; that is, there is no reason to suppose in Bain that the proof that showed the agent was deceived would act also have showed that the Comptroller was deceived, whereas here one of the descriptive paragraphs in the indictment was not in fact proved at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.678" offset="2096072">Nevertheless, the kind of reasoning that the Court used in Bain does very strongly support the result reached by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.378" offset="2126897">However, the continuing vitality or validity of Bain can't be discussed here without also considering the Court's holdings 40 years later in two cases... Salinger against the United States and Ford against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.199" offset="2190113">Salinger is a case that resembles the instant case quite closely.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.665" offset="2212056">It's a case in which the defendant was charged in numerous counts, at least more than seven, of a rather complicated mail fraud scheme, and the description in the counts alleged 12 different means of carrying out the scheme to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.157" offset="2293976">However, at the close of the evidence at trial it was determined that only one means alleged in one count had been sufficiently proven to justify submission to the jury and thereupon the case was submitted to the jury on the basis of only one of the 12 means alleged in one count.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.681" offset="2368059">And Salinger was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.835" offset="2380702">And he appealed, quite reasonably invoking Bain, and this Court said Bain is no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.645" offset="2415915">It proceeded to offer some rather, I think, insubstantial distinctions between Bain and Salinger, and it said nobody could... I'm paraphrasing... nobody could seriously contend that Salinger's right to indictment had been defeated by the failure to prove most of what was alleged in the indictment, as long as what was proved was sufficient to make out an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.841" offset="2492715">In Ford, which came along a year later, the Court was confronted with a case which was almost exactly like Bain.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.789" offset="2528555">In Ford, what happened was that the indictment charged a conspiracy with multiple objectives, one of the objectives being the violation of a treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.520" offset="2563455">And as it turned out, the violation of a treaty was not a crime and, therefore, a conspiracy to violate the treaty was not a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.313" offset="2606609">But the other objectives charged in the indictment was in fact valid crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.030" offset="2625522">Ford came to this Court invoking Ex Parte Bain, and, as you see, the case is quite parallel because Ford involved a partial allegation of something that was not in fact a crime, just as Bain involved in part an allegation of something that was not a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.163" offset="2693963">And the Court said it's mere surplusage and it can be ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.145" offset="2713920">Now that would have and in fact in Salinger the Court used language of limitation, limiting Salinger to its facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.392" offset="2754880">That would probably have been enough to put Bain to rest, except for the fact that about 25 years ago Bain was cited favorably in Stirone against the United States and then again in Russell, and that has somewhat raised the question again as to whether Bain somehow remains good law despite what was done to it in Salinger and Ford.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.647" offset="2847981">Now let me turn from a discussion of specific precedents to a somewhat broader effort to fit the issue that is presented here into the fabric of modern grand jury law and considerations of logic and policy that I think quite clearly suggest what the answer ought to be in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.874" offset="2924885">Let me first ask the question which is involved in the way the Ninth Circuit looked at this case, and that is whether it is a proper approach to determine the fit between the indictment and the proof at trial to ask whether the grand jury might not have indicted on the basis of the proof at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.004" offset="3021329">Now preliminarily, before getting to that question, I would like to say that the premise that the Ninth Circuit relied on here, speculating that the grand jury might not have indicted, is a quite implausible premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.061" offset="3089561">After all, the crime was rooking the insurance company out of money in connection with a claim under a policy to which respondent well knew he was not entitled, and a substantial sum of money at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.306" offset="3134596">That was the gravamen of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.696" offset="3140134">Is it really conceivable that a grand jury presented only with a grossly inflated claim would have elected not to indict?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="758.302" stopTime="768.860">
            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="758.302" offset="3170541">What you're saying is that the inflation of a claim could have happened without the phony burglary, but the phony burglary by itself wouldn't have stated any sort of a crime?</text>

            <text syncTime="768.860" offset="3212755">Well, the phony burglary by itself would not have stated mail fraud without a claim, but I think what I am saying is that from the standpoint of the decision whether or not to indict, if we are going to speculate... and I don't believe we should... but if we were going to speculate about what the grand jury might have done, it seems to me that from the standpoint of the seriousness of respondent's conduct there is very little difference between the offense proved at trial and the offense with the additional element alleged in the indictment and, therefore, such speculation in quite implausible, that the grand jury might not have indicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="805.518" offset="3359458">But, of course, once you get into the business of speculation, I suppose you could speculate that if the indictment was off three or four days as to the time, even though there was not a material variance, you know, one particular juror might have felt well, geez, it was a little longer ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="821.058" offset="3421630">Well, that is, of course... that is, of course, a problem, and as I said at the beginning of the argument, it is frequently the case that there is some lack of correspondence between the proof at trial and the description of the offense contained in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.583" offset="3479726">That's commonplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.926" offset="3485055">Normally that is treated as a matter of variance and the courts say we're going to ask whether the defendant was prejudiced by this difference between what was proved and what was alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.563" offset="3527582">And if it's found that the defendant had adequate notice and wasn't prejudiced, then the court says, as it did in Berger and a number of other cases, that variance is immaterial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1136.947" offset="4685120">Would it not be better to simply strike the allegations entirely so that you only have the jury knowing that the government at least thought that this was a phony theft?</text>

            <text syncTime="1145.678" offset="4720020">That is our view, and we do not ask the Court to distinguish Bain on the ground that there was not an actual physical change in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.519" offset="4751471">The point I wanted to make about the screening function, which is fairly obvious when you think about it for a minute, is that it is rather fruitless to ask yourself whether the grand jury would have found probable cause to justify bringing respondent to trial after he has been tried and found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.543" offset="4815524">That is, at that point the concern about the screening function is greatly diminished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.228" offset="4838302">The people who are meant to be protected primarily by the screening function are people who are going to be acquitted at trial because there's not a valid basis for charging them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.522" offset="4867455">This particular kind of remedy does those people no good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.255" offset="4882397">Now the second point that I want to make about the Ninth Circuit's approach is that the idea of comparing what the grand jury may have heard with what the petty jury actually heard is totally inconsistent with the line of cases from Holt through Costello, Lawn, Blue, and up to Calandra, which establish that the grand jury can hear many kinds of evidence that would not properly be admitted before the petty jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.510" offset="4991380">So the grand jury could return an indictment hearing only... having introduced before it only some illegally seized evidence that can't be introduced at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.788" offset="5024503">Now if that is legitimate, as this Court has held it is, necessarily the petty jury will hear totally different evidence from what the grand jury has heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.409" offset="5062955">So what is the point of asking yourself... I mean, you are totally defeating this whole system of allowing the grand jury to hear all kinds of evidence if you are going to reverse a conviction because the petty jury heard less evidence on some points than the grand jury heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.310" offset="5126590">Now, third, if you think about it for a moment, this idea of speculating about what the grand jury would have done if it had heard evidence of a less grievous or less culpable or less far-reaching scheme, which is what the petty jury heard, how could you ever uphold a conviction for a lesser included offense or a conviction on only one or a few of numerous counts in an indictment?</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.532" offset="5239439">Precisely the same rationale would lead you say well, maybe if the grand jury had only heard an involuntary manslaughter case instead of a murder case, or maybe if it only heard larceny instead of armed robbery, it would not have chosen to indict at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.136" offset="5301924">So that would mean that every time somebody was convicted of a greater offense... indicated for a greater offense, convicted of a lesser included, you should reverse his conviction and make the prosecution start all over to see if they can get an indictment only for the lesser offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.473" offset="5363259">Now, fourth, the result reached in this case provides, in practical terms, exactly the wrong incentives to prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.344" offset="5398786">First of all, it tells the prosecutors instead of returning a rather comprehensive indictment that describes the scheme as thoroughly as they see it at the time of indictment, return a bare bones indictment because you return a bare bones indictment, you specify absolutely the minimum, then you will protect yourself against having a conviction reversed because it doesn't correspond, because you haven't proved every allegation in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.128" offset="5517904">That can hardly be in the interest of defendants as a class, and it doesn't seem to me that it is in the interests of the notice function or the smooth functioning of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.984" offset="5553326">Even worse, what it does in a case like this is it says to the prosecutor you may not think the jury ought to credit the false burglary evidence, and you may wish not to present it because, as you now see the case, it's just not credible and you doubt you can establish it beyond a reasonable doubt, but you'd better put that evidence in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.460" offset="5635246">You better put that evidence in anyway because that's the only way to protect yourself against the Miller reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.550" offset="5659592">So it provides exactly the wrong incentives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.065" offset="5673594">And, finally, it is obviously totally inconsistent with Salinger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.486" offset="5691253">I mean, in Salinger you had numerous counts, you had 12 specifications, only one of which was submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.546" offset="5719569">You cannot possibly square a reversal here with the Court's affirmance of the conviction in Salinger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.855" offset="5740781">Now, let me turn to respondent's tack because I think he does not seek to rely, the way the Court of Appeals did and the way Bain did, on this kind of speculation about what the grand jury would or might have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.680" offset="5796056">Instead he seeks to persuade the Court that what was proved at trial was in reality a difference offense from the one charged in the indictment, so that his right to be tried only on an indictment charging the offense was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.625" offset="5851853">And he also suggests, without giving particulars, that he was prejudiced here by the indictment's failure to give notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.232" offset="5878289">And we've answered this contention in the reply brief and I don't propose to spend any more time on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.550" offset="6591537">Nobody disagrees about the broadly stated proposition that a defendant should not be convicted for an offense that is different from the one that he has been indicted for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.985" offset="6625287">But unfortunately this proposition is virtually useless for deciding actual cases, since, as this case well illustrates, there can be great disagreement about what constitutes a different offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.085" offset="6709715">We think there should be two inquiries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.163" offset="6717969">First, are the elements of the offense proved at trial the same as the elements of the offense, prove, that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.363" offset="6746809">We don't think you can be indicted for bank robbery and convicted of arson, to take an extreme case, or indicted for wire fraud and convicted for mail fraud.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerrold M. Ladar</label>
            <text syncTime="1691.332" offset="6902707">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, the problem presented before reaching the merits of the question of overruling Bain, as the government seeks to do, is more fundamental for a reviewing court than perhaps any case that I have been able to review and see in this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.713" offset="6988180">This is a case in which there is no trial transcript before the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.415" offset="7006988">It is a case in which there was nothing but stipulated facts of a rather bare bones nature before the circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.397" offset="7038962">At the Circuit Court argument, the oral argument, the question of prejudice to the defendant arose and I again repeated for that court, to the three Justices sitting, that we were prejudiced, as we had alleged in our reply brief in that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.654" offset="7107925">It is impossible to tell, of course, from the opinion that is before this Court what reaction the Circuit Court had in that respect because the questions of the Circuit Court to counsel at argument and the replies of counsel are nowhere in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.101" offset="7173754">Indeed, last week I received by Federal Express from the Solicitor General a grand jury transcript which had not been ever provided prior to trial, which no one, neither the District Court nor myself nor the Court of Appeals had ever seen before but which is now lodged before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.889" offset="7252957">It's the testimony of Agent Humphrey summarizing the case, and in that particular transcript, which I assume the United States has obtained pursuant to an order of release of the grand jury transcript under Rule 6(e), or I hope I'm not contempt in having it, even though I didn't call for it, but it was handed to me by the government, in that particular transcript, unknown to all of us below, and particularly to the Ninth Circuit, one of the grand jurors began an inquiry into whether or not they needed to deal with the inflated value of the copper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.563" offset="7399661">And another grand juror said no, no, you don't have to worry about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.515" offset="7411468">It wasn't ever stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.484" offset="7415334">These are the kinds of things that may have led, particularly Justice Pregerson, to the conclusions that the Ninth Circuit was dealing with as to whether or not the case ever would have been indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.711" offset="7468206">Those were the questions asked at the Ninth Circuit oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.773" offset="7480431">This is a most inappropriate case, under these circumstances, for this Court to begin to speculate about what the Ninth Circuit thought it had before it, because what went on at the Ninth Circuit is again partially hidden from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.314" offset="7538632">The government originally proceeded on the basis that they would live with certain facts in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.062" offset="7561620">They tried to get out of that in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.967" offset="7573218">They have now lodged materials which either were never available before or which have been produced, such as the trial transcript, but were never available to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.932" offset="7613133">And indeed it is the most inappropriate vehicle for the granting of certiorari, let alone the determination that it stands as a proper vehicle to go back into the system, saying this is where the Ninth Circuit erred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1945.806" offset="7920542">I think that is a terrible mistake because it denigrates the whole process into one in which, as a reviewing court, you are accepting propositions that were different from the ones presented to the Court of Appeals, and I think that it would be naive to suggest that Court of Appeals Justices do not listen to what is said in oral argument in making decisions of the type that that Court made in the Miller case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.140" offset="8021898">The substantially different scheme language which is used in the Court of Appeals opinion must to some extent arise from the inquiry that they made at the oral argument in respect to these matters in which a government counsel sat to my left and never contradicted a statement which was made in my reply brief in the Ninth Circuit, which again is never contradicted until a week before oral argument the government desires to send matters to this Court over the transom, so to speak, and say here they are but don't look at them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2436.815" offset="9884637">So we proceeded on the basis that Fisher was going to make a grand entrance and we prepared for the case on that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.765" offset="9916402">We also were told by the government that they would not give us the statements of Fisher on others until five days before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.512" offset="9951406">Even though the Solicitor General has mentioned that the Assistant has advised them that it was a month and a half before trial, there is a letter in the material furnished to this Court, addressed to me from Mr. Robinson, which says I am still holding back until five days before trial before I give you materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.208" offset="10022146">We started the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.660" offset="10027997">We defended the case, and we proceeded through the trial of the case, understanding that the false burglary, some allegations of some arson or tampering-like conduct by Miller, and the action of his accomplice, Fisher, was the underpinning of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.465" offset="10099259">We focused the defense in that respect, and in so doing we were led to a very serious prejudicial position when the case fell apart in respect to both the inflated insurance limits evidence and Fisher's failure to show up, and the failure to be able to prove a false burglary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3097.913" offset="12528960">I believe, for example, that Stirone, which involved simply the interstate transportation or the interstate movement of a product, is far different than Bain's protection because Stirone alleged and dealt only with the aspect of whether or not a jurisdictional element had been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.717" offset="12612239">The extortion is the crime, much like the scheme is the crime here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.090" offset="12633764">And, therefore, the change in respect to whether the sand came from Pennsylvania or whether it was steel that was involved, leaving aside the prospective shipments which the Supreme Court decided to ignore and the Court of Appeals had dealt with, simply did not raise any new issue or deal with any difficulty with the proposition that the grand jury indictment must, even though it may cover up guilt from time to time in respect to the double jeopardy protections that the Solicitor General is interested in, that Bain simply did not change any fundamental protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.495" offset="12799380">What this Court is embarking upon if it overrules Bain is to make a truism out of the criticism that is leveled at the grand jury in the Federal system today, that what it does doesn't mean anything because we'll figure out afterwards whether the defendant looked like he was guilty of something pretty close.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.175" offset="12862074">If the scheme and the trial simply narrow the charges, I have no quarrel with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.767" offset="12888405">The problem in this case in respect to Bain is that the grand jury indicted for something totally different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.936" offset="12917140">That proposition should not be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.404" offset="12930933">Bain should not be overruled because Bain affords an important protection; it's one that requires that there really be some screening process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.023" offset="12969489">And in that respect, if this Court were to believe that you should proceed to analyze those cases, then I suggest the materials lodged by the government be carefully read, because when you see the process of the grand jury in those materials you will see that the protection was in fact operating and that if Mr. Fisher had not testified, there would most likely have been no indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.467" offset="13071262">That proposition is what is stated in Bain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.935" offset="13081084">It doesn't require any speculation any more because I think these materials demonstrate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.808" offset="13100624">I am just somewhat sad that it starts only here in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3312.201" offset="13386195">The overruling of Bain would cause a fundamental shift in the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.667" offset="13408033">None of the policy arguments that the Solicitor General has suggested are really problems which can't be addressed by a more careful analysis of cases by prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's office.</text>

            <text syncTime="3408.286" offset="14325767">I want to be clear on one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.192" offset="14325662">The notion that this is a substantially different scheme is not part of the Ninth Circuit's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.956" offset="14325558">In its initial opinion, before we filed our petition for rehearing focusing on Salinger, it had talked about a substantially narrower scheme, and the case on which it relied, Hastelotto, dealt with a substantially narrower scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.903" offset="14325453">We pointed out that Salinger dealt with a substantially narrower scheme, and the way they dealt with that was simply to change the word "narrower" to "different" in their opinion, which puts me in mind of the old riddle about if you call a horse's tail a leg, how many legs do five horses have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.819" offset="14325349">Of course, the answer is not 25, but it's still 20, because calling a horse's tail a leg doesn't make it one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.847" offset="14325244">And in this case, too, just calling the scheme substantially different will not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.313" offset="14325140">Now when we got to the Supreme Court we have suddenly had suggestions about what happened or what didn't happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.513" offset="14325035">If there was a claim of actual prejudice, that claim should have been made in the Court of Appeals and considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.715" offset="14324931">If there was a claim that the indictment was inadequate to describe gross inflation, that claim should have been made in the Court of Appeals and considered there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.993" offset="14324827">None of that has to do with the question that is here today, which is simply the correspondence between the indictment and the proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.536" offset="14324722">And let me close with one other question that I think the Court needs to think about: If Miller is right and the Ninth Circuit is right here, what happens with this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.032" offset="14324618">Are we barred from reprosecuting it at all, or can we go back and return an indictment which is pegged to paragraph 7 and reprosecute this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.513" offset="14324513">Now I think it's important to think about that because the result, if we are barred, we are being barred from prosecuting a case even though we have proved guilt of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt simply because of a defect in the way the case was indicted relative to the way the case was tried, which is not what the double jeopardy clause is really concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.330" offset="14324409">If we're not barred, which I think must be the result, from going back, getting a new indictment charging the same scheme based only on the narrower description of it, then we're sure that's the way we want the system to work.</text>
