            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="116280">Mr. Come, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="71.012" offset="400283">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="74.714" offset="415121">The question presented in this case is whether the National Labor Relations Board has authority under Section 9(b) of the Act which gives the Board broad discretion in regard to establishing units appropriate for collective bargaining, to exclude from a bargaining unit employees who are close relatives of the owners of a closely held corporation that employs them without a showing that the employee relatives receive special job-related privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.589" offset="570602">The basic facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.225" offset="585126">Respondent is an automobile parts and gasoline dealer in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.379" offset="601740">The dealership, a closely held corporation, is owned equally by three brothers, Richard, Robert and James Sabo, who are President, Vice President, and Secretary-Treasurer respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.139" offset="668822">The three Sabo brothers are actively involved in Respondent's daily operations; together they make all of its policy decisions and retain ultimate responsibility for the supervision of all of its partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.516" offset="738308">In March of 1981 the Retail Employees Union filed a petition with the Board requesting that a representation election be held among Respondent's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.843" offset="795568">Respondent from the union stipulated to an election in two bargaining units, a unit of store and warehouse employees at Respondent's nine retail stores, and a unit of office clerical employees at Respondent's headquarters office.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.106" offset="880623">The union received a plurality of the votes in the election, but the validity of its certification as the bargaining representative for both of these units turns on the validity of the Board's action in sustaining the challenges to the ballots of Diane and Mildred Sabo.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.455" offset="970066">Diane is the wife of Respondent's President Richard Sabo.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.157" offset="988874">She is a regular part time general ledger clerk at the headquarters office.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.346" offset="1013638">She resides with her husband, and both work at the same office.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.433" offset="1037984">At work she often goes to lunch with her husband, or one or both of his brothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.820" offset="1063480">Mildred Sabo, the mother of the three Sabo brothers who own and operate Respondent, is a full time cashier at one of the retail stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.462" offset="1114053">She lives with Secretary-Treasurer James Sabo in a house that he owns, and she sees or has contact with her other sons and their families on a regular basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.870" offset="1163686">The Board, applying its longstanding policy of excluding close relatives of the owners of a closely held corporation from bargaining units where the family relationship is such as to remove the employee relative from the community of interests shared with other employees, concluded that Diane and Mildred Sabo should be excluded from the bargaining unit because in view of their relationship to Respondent's owners, their interests were more closely allied with management than with the other employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.395" offset="1425851">I would think there is an argument there that Congress has already spoken to this subject and it has not gone as far as the Board has.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.318" offset="1453540">That was the basis on which the Sixth Circuit refused to enforced the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.655" offset="1478827">It felt constrained by Section 2(3) of the statute which excludes from the definition of employee any individual employed by his parent or spouse, which... it is the Board's position that this provision which goes back to the Wagner Act days simply defined the relatives of employers of... who are wholly outside of the Act's protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.995" offset="1628247">It says nothing about how the Board should exercise its discretion in determining appropriate units with respect to relatives who are employees within the Act's coverage.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.238" offset="1681224">But Mr. Come, the Board is relying on Section 9(b) authority, and 9(b) speaks in terms of selection of an employer unit, a craft unit, a plant unit, or a subdivision, and it just doesn't address itself to picking out individuals, does it?</text>

            <text syncTime="415.786" offset="1779340">However, the Board from its earliest days, in defining units under Section 9(b), has used a community of interest standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.732" offset="1847153">The purpose in defining the unit under that standard is to put together groupings of employees that have a unity of economic interests and try to exclude employees that do not share.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.811" offset="1935447">Well, is it the Board's position that it could employ a standard that would exclude individuals simply based on anti-union animus alone?</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="473.475" offset="2010158">--Because, the statute certainly, since the Taft-Hartley amendments, as this Court made clear in Savair, is, mandates neutrality with respect to whether employees wish to select a union or not wish to select a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.661" offset="2126873">So that would not be a permissible criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.796" offset="2143382">However, I should like to point out that the basis for the Board's exclusion of close relatives from units does not turn on that factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.859" offset="2231676">That may be a consequence of the exclusion, but that is not the basis for the exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.049" offset="2256440">One might argue, for example, that if you were to exclude an employee who is highly skilled and makes substantially more an hour from a unit with relatively low paid employees on the ground that they do not share the same unity of economic interest, it may be likely that this high skilled employee might be less disposed to vote for the union than would be the rank and file.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.626" offset="2422683">But that is not the basis for the exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.578" offset="2434491">The basis is whether they share an economic, a community of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.315" offset="2461449">Now, the board from its earliest days has excluded close relatives that do not fit the 2(3) definition from bargaining units.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="696.350" offset="2901664">Well, the Board, the Board's position is that it is a reasonable and permissible interpretation of its role under the statute to be empowered to find that relatives who would meet the Caravelle criteria, that what we are talking about essentially is close relatives of owners of closely held companies, because the way it is worked out is that unless you have had that situation, the Board has not found that a lack of community interest based solely on the family relationship but has required a showing of a special job state, so that in your example of just a close friend, in that situation the Board has uniformly required more in the way of a showing to warrant exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.184" offset="3208969">It would not exclude that sort of a relationship purely on the basis of a relationship, I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.123" offset="3240734">Now, we think that the Board's policy as it is implemented at least for the past fifteen years since the Board has embraced the Caravelle policy, does further the basic purpose involved in defining appropriate units because the Board's task in defining these units, as I indicated at the outset, is to try to get a grouping of employees that is going to make for efficient collective bargaining, get a cohesiveness of economic interests and try to minimize conflicting interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.867" offset="3519722">And the Caravelle policy does further these objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.204" offset="3553054">As the Board has pointed out in its decisions, employee relatives, particularly those who reside with owners of the business, have an access to management not shared by other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.517" offset="3634347">Thus, their perceived need for collective representation to provide such access differs substantially from those of other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.075" offset="3676561">Moreover, employee relatives who are financially dependent on the owner are likely to be motivated by other considerations, considerations that are very different from those of employees that do not have this relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.656" offset="3762869">Now, this is apt to manifest itself not so... not only in determining whether to vote for the union or not vote for the election... union, but even should a union be selected in the plant, in terms of what issues to present for collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.354" offset="3857642">It is the Board's judgment that you are apt to get many more conflicts in that stage of the negotiation, somewhat analogous to the conflicts that this Court pointed out in Pittsburgh Plate Glass in concluding that retirees were not appropriately placed in the same bargaining unit with active employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.508" offset="3990239">So in short, the Board's policy of family exclusion furthers the basic purpose of the Act of ensuring effective collective bargaining and avoiding conflicts in bargaining once a bargaining agent is selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.361" offset="4101625">Secondly, the exclusion of such employee relatives furthers collective bargaining in that the presence of such a close relative in union discussions is likely to be viewed with suspicion and distrust by the other employees and put a damper on union deliberations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.505" offset="5614220">In this case, that is relatives of owner-managers of a closely held corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1450.756" offset="5919225">It effectuates the purposes of the Act and congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.223" offset="5941168">Now, in its statements to you, the Board indicated that it has a longstanding policy of exclusion of relatives based on family ties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.217" offset="5989129">That we tend to differ upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.252" offset="6005220">As a matter of fact, since 1953, throughout, the Board has applied a special status test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.458" offset="6046076">From 1953 to 1967, they consistently applied the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.029" offset="6068332">From 1967, when they passed their decision in Foam Rubber, they indicated that they were now going to go back to a family tie only test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.002" offset="6112218">However, as the courts indicated in reviewed decisions of the Board, that was not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.758" offset="6143251">The Board continued to use at various times special status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.044" offset="6156417">I think the Caravelle court even said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.460" offset="6166030">Subsequent to that and the supposed adoption of the adoption of Caravelle, the Board continue at times to use special status cases, and Linn Gear, a Ninth Circuit case, commented on that particular point, so that since 1953... and Linn Gear was decided, I believe, in 1979... the Board has applied in various degrees a special status test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.663" offset="6282850">The Sixth Circuit test which relies not to exclude solely on the basis of family ties but is a test in which family ties can be used to demonstrate special status if there are special job privileges and benefits that flow to the employee as a basis of that family relationship, is a neutral test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.416" offset="6393922">It takes... it respects all sides because it is related to the job place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.634" offset="6414716">The Board, through what it indicates, an adoption of Caravelle, which I am going to comment because that is not the entire Board theory, but in terms of Caravelle, adopts what is... what is called an expanded community of interest test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.679" offset="6482948">It looks to things that have no impact or nothing to do with the terms and conditions as they relate to the job place itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.352" offset="6513668">The Sixth Circuit test refuses to do that and remains neutral which is exactly what Savair calls for, as this Court indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.374" offset="6557762">The Sixth Circuit test does not look to loyalty or divided loyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.878" offset="6583780">It does not look to how an employee may or may not vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.015" offset="6596319">It does not look to how an employee... whether the employee has engaged in any union activity, which is exactly one of the factors the Board looks to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.287" offset="6641354">The Board in 1972 and 1974 adopted Caravelle standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.060" offset="6668417">They haven't applied them uniformly since, but nevertheless, they indicated that that's what they were adopting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.929" offset="6687957">However, and as the Board points out in their brief, in a footnote, they also adopted Linn Gear, which was then also adopted by Pattison of the Eight... case in the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.468" offset="6734141">Linn Gear, one of the factors in Linn Gear is you are supposed to explore and look at what union activity, if any, the relative has engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.657" offset="6766847">Now, that, it seems to me, flies directly in the face of not only Savair, but the congressional amendments of 1947 which talk about, in Section 7, the employee has the absolute right to engage in union activity, collective bargaining, et cetera, et cetera, but also has the absolute right to refrain therefrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.054" offset="6848453">In addition, 9(b) in 1947 was changed to grant to all employees their fullest freedoms as it relates to all sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.528" offset="6890353">And again, 9(b) flows from Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.814" offset="6903519">As a matter of fact, Section 7, if it could be characterized as such, is the guts of this Act, and that is to protect the rights of employees, whether or not they are engaged in... or are pro-union or anti-union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.454" offset="6954092">So when the question was asked previously as to whether or not union animus might be considered, in Linn Gear that is one of the factors that is put down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.112" offset="6996724">What activity, if any, has this employee engaged in vis-a-vis the union?</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.731" offset="7015114">Now, that really should have nothing to do with whether or not an employee has a right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.949" offset="7032042">In other words, if a union is going to present evidence, or someone presents evidence that an employee passed cards out and happens to be the sister of the owner, well, am I to assume that because that individual passed cards that she could now vote, or if that employee did not pass cards out or sign the cards, that employee cannot vote?</text>

            <text syncTime="1830.898" offset="7439865">Caravelle plus Linn Gear is the test the Board relies on because the Board has adopted Linn Gear and indicates so in its brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1885.468" offset="7658144">As indicated previously, the Board, although it indicates in 1967 it switched back to a family only tie, based upon Foam Rubber City, the fact of the matter is in all the courts that have reviewed Board conduct since then have indicated that it has engaged in at best a checkered course, and even since Foam Rubber and even since Caravelle, has at various times applies a special status test as to relatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="1921.158" offset="7800878">Basically I understand the Board has broad authority as it relates to unit determinations, but they do not have the unlimited discretion to interpret statutory language in a manner that is inconsistent with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.001" offset="7860228">2(3) specifically designates what an employee is, and it indicates what relatives are to be out on a per se basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.126" offset="7904740">All the courts, including Caravelle, in Caravelle 1, I believe, indicated that what... that the Board's intent through 9(b) was in effect a modification, an impermissible modification of Section 2.3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.253" offset="7973286">All courts have said that, even Caravelle 1.</text>

            <text syncTime="1975.359" offset="8017694">Caravelle then went on, for whatever reason, to draft an expanded community of interest test which allowed the Board or gave the Board some guideline as to whether or not they wanted to follow factors that again had nothing to do with their ability or their factors on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.736" offset="8087180">And as a matter of fact, the Board, the Court in Caravelle 2, I believe, specifically indicated that the factors they set up have nothing to do with the terms and conditions of the employee at the job.</text>

            <text syncTime="2061.914" offset="8363869">We are not going to exclude an employee from a bargaining unit simply because of this family relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2075.789" offset="8419353">The employee, however, is still an employee under the Act, now, which raises an interesting sort of a situation because unlike the cases that have come before the Court with the confidential employee in Hendricks or in Bell Aerospace when we are talking about managerial employees, in those cases, not only was the employee out of the unit, regardless of whether they still remained an employee under the act, but the work they did left the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.308" offset="8533456">In other words, it was the work, the work that triggered the exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.879" offset="8551741">In this particular case, the work remains in the unit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2396.111" offset="9700711">--Two small points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.962" offset="9708025">The first point that I want to make is that there's actually a very narrow difference between the Board and the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.393" offset="9793811">The Court of Appeals agrees that if you had special job status, you could exclude these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.649" offset="9830801">However, the Court requires at least two instances because there was one instance in... of special status, and they said, in connection with Diane Sabo, and they said that was not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.575" offset="9890569">The only difference is whether or not the Board can reasonably conclude that there are certain circumstances, of which this case is one, where the nature of the relationship is such that even though it has not manifested itself in special job privileges, the relationship is such as to warrant the conclusion that the employees still do not have the same community of interest with the other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.883" offset="10043751">We submit that this is an allowable choice of the Board to make in the exercise of its Section 9(b) unit determination authority, that the history of the 2(3) exclusion which is set forth at page 26 of our brief, which is a Wagner Act exclusion, gives no indication whatsoever that Congress, in putting in that exclusion, intended in any way to restrict the Board's ability to define, to exclude other relatives from bargaining units.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.360" offset="10201635">The Senate report says that the exclusion was put in for administrative reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.764" offset="10227235">The Committee deemed it wise not to include under the bill agricultural laborers, persons in domestic service of any family or person in his home, or any individual employed by his parent or spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.857" offset="10283660">It seems evident that what Congress was concerned about was excluding very, very localized situations that they thought were not even subject to the Board's jurisdiction at all and were not at all focusing on the problem of the Board's ability to exclude from bargaining units employees who were subject to the Board's jurisdiction.</text>
