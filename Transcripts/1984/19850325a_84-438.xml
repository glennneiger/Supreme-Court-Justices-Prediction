            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="135794">We'll hear arguments next in Massachusetts Correctional Institution against Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.379" offset="185218">Ms. Smith, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_a_h_smith" startTime="74.870" stopTime="282.469">
            <label>Ms. Barbara A. H. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="74.870" offset="435262">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, the particular issues that we bring to this Court for review are whether the due process clause of the United States Constitution as held by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts requires judicial review of the sufficiency of the factual findings of the Prison Disciplinary Board when those findings form the basis for a loss of good time credits to inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.368" offset="537244">Second, assuming that judicial review is required, whether the Constitution requires any greater scrutiny than inquiry into whether the decision is supported by some or any facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.826" offset="587085">The particular issues, however, I think implicate a much more fundamental and far-reaching issue, and that is the extent to which the Court will involve itself in the internal decisionmaking ability of prison administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.516" offset="649779">This case concerns what I believe is a very central concern of the prison system and that is the ability of the administrators to maintain discipline within the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.804" offset="690948">This decision goes far beyond merely requiring certain procedural requirements of the disciplinary hearing, but indeed establishes the court as the ultimate fact finder in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.361" offset="745178">To subject the internal determinations regarding discipline to judicial second-guessing will result in substantial disruption to the prison system, to unnecessary but increasing demands on the judiciary, and will result in minimal salutary benefit to the inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.385" offset="821247">Now, the specific incidents which give rise to the instant case are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.409" offset="837338">I will be very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.209" offset="844548">A guard on duty at a wing door into the yard at Walpole State Prison heard an inmate call out, "What's going on here"?</text>
            <text syncTime="186.696" offset="882478">The guard moved to a window in the door leading out to the yard, where he again heard the inmate call out, "What's going on here"?</text>
            <text syncTime="193.150" offset="908392">He peered out the window, observed a commotion, opened the door, and found the inmate bleeding from his mouth, with a puffed eye.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.315" offset="940992">He immediately observed three inmates jogging away down a closed-in walkway into the regular yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.759" offset="970772">Disciplinary reports issued and a hearing was held for each inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.792" offset="986863">The reporting officer testified substantially as I have just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.986" offset="1003686">However, in the hearing for innate Crawford... Hill... I'm sorry... the officer testified that a medic had told him that the injuries were consistent with the inmate having been beaten.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.594" offset="1058125">Crawford testified that he knew nothing of the event and offered an affidavit from the injured inmate that Crawford had not been involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.760" offset="1086756">Hill also testified that he knew nothing about the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.662" offset="1098354">The Board found the inmates guilty and ordered loss of 100 days' good time credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.746" offset="1122700">Hill and Crawford appealed to the Superintendent who affirmed the decision of the Disciplinary Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.189" offset="1144538">By regulation, the Commissioner of Correction also reviews any loss of good time cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.613" offset="1166168">The inmates then filed a pro se complaint in the Superior Court of Massachusetts, alleging that the evidence was insufficient to support the finding of the Disciplinary Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.620" offset="1206187">The Superior Court, having reviewed the Disciplinary Board's findings, concluded that as a matter of law the Board's findings of guilty rested on no evidence constitutionally adequate to support the findings of the Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.469" offset="1265642">May I ask, Ms. Smith, I gather that Massachusetts practice provides for this review in Superior Court, does it?</text>

          <turn speaker="barbara_a_h_smith" startTime="289.402" stopTime="352.576">
            <label>Ms. Barbara A. H. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="289.402" offset="1293332">I believe it provides only as a result of the Supreme Judicial Court held in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.059" offset="1323947">Now, the Superintendent appealed the Superior Court Decision, alleging that there was no constitutional right to judicial review of this nature, of the sufficiency of the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.598" offset="1374103">The Supreme Judicial Court held that there is no statutory right of review in Massachusetts for issues of this nature, but that its reading of Wolff v. McDonnell, it felt, logically entitled an inmate to judicial review as a matter of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.349" offset="1457172">Therefore, having reached this result, the Court construed Massachusetts law, particularly the certiorari aspect of Massachusetts law, as providing the appropriate vehicle for raising this constitutional claim; not that it was an independent statutory right, independent of the constitutional finding.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.794" offset="1550899">The decision, I don't believe, is state law at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.377" offset="1569290">Throughout the opinion, the Supreme Judicial Court refers to this Court's decision in Wolff v. McDonnell, and they rule specifically and that was the issue presented to them, that it is the Constitution, the due process clause in the United States Constitution which mandates judicial review.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="377.800" offset="1646925">So whether or not... I think you suggested the inmates have a constitutional or nonconstitutional claim in respect to a disciplinary hearing, they are not entitled to any judicial review--</text>

            <text syncTime="399.895" offset="1735324">Suppose there was absolutely no evidence in the record instead of what you had here.</text>

            <label>Ms. Barbara A. H. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="403.378" offset="1749221">Then I think, Your Honor, we'd got into a question of whether there is an arbitrary capricious denial of the inmates' liberty interest, which I believe is quite different from the court reviewing the weight, the credibility, the quantum of evidence upon which a Board makes its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.579" offset="1822050">And it is the latter that our court has said--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="424.471" offset="1833649">In other words, you would concede that the law, whether it was... say, federal law... requires that there be some evidence in the record to support the finding of guilt.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_a_h_smith" startTime="433.907" stopTime="441.392">
            <label>Ms. Barbara A. H. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="433.907" offset="1871370">--I believe that that is the scope of review where there is a claim of an arbitrary denial of a constitutionally protected right.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="445.975" offset="1919644">So your argument really is on the standard of whether it's sufficiency or just some evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.507" offset="1933750">That's your real bone of contention.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Ms. Barbara A. H. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="450.889" offset="1939288">That is one bone of contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.790" offset="1946916">The other bone of contention is whether the Constitution requires the reviewability in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.834" offset="1979098">And I think it's very difficult to separate the question of reviewability in general from the question of scope of review, because many of the same factors inform the decision in both areas.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="474.045" stopTime="486.510">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="474.045" offset="2031970">Well, I thought you agreed with me that you did need reviewability in general in order to determine whether the decision was entirely arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.658" offset="2062377">How else could you ever know it was entirely arbitrary without some kind of judicial review?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_a_h_smith" startTime="486.510" stopTime="496.068">
            <label>Ms. Barbara A. H. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="486.510" offset="2081812">Then I might rephrase it; reviewable only for arbitrary or capriciousness, but not reviewable for determination of sufficiency.</text>

            <text syncTime="518.213" offset="2208558">Your Honor, I don't think that we can pass over or just ignore the question of what is the constitutionally required general scope of reviewability.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.489" offset="2253698">And I will move ahead in my argument, and I think the case of Ortwein v. Schwab points out what I mean here.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.574" offset="2286090">In that case, a petitioner claimed that an order reducing his welfare benefits was not supported by reliable, probative, or substantive evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.842" offset="2331125">Now, judicial review was provided by the state there; however, a $25 filing fee precluded these indigent appellants from having access to the state-provided judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.921" offset="2383474">This Court held that there was no due process violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.103" offset="2396117">It held that due process did not require appellate review, that due process only requires a predetermination evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.239" offset="2436659">And where procedural requirements are met, due process requires nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.422" offset="2453482">Now, that case dealt with reviewability.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.954" offset="2463513">It didn't limit itself to the standard that would be applied if someone alleged arbitrary and capriciousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.319" offset="2489009">I think it is on all fours with the question that we are presenting here, and that the same reasoning that applies in Ortwein should be applied in the case at hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.054" offset="2531954">Going back to, if I may, the reliance of the Supreme Judicial Court on the Wolf decision, I think it's entirely misplaced and reads much too much into that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.013" offset="2579810">In Wolff, this Court merely set out certain procedural requirements to be applied to disciplinary hearing, included advanced written notice of the charges, an opportunity to be heard, and to present evidence under certain circumstances, and a requirement that a written statement of the evidence and the reasons for the sanction be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.218" offset="2668627">The Court indicated that these protections were necessary to guarantee fundamental fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.550" offset="2689943">The Court never indicated that judicial review of the legal sufficiency of the evidence was an additional constitutionally necessary safeguard, or that there was a constitutionally required evidentiary standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="893.207" offset="3708614">Loss of good time credits does not involve the loss of a fundamental constitutional right, and in any event the court indicated the primary reason for the requirement of this statement was for its use in collateral administrative proceedings such as transfer decisions based on the incident or parole determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.439" offset="3777472">As I have already indicated in the Ortwein v. Schwab case, this Court has held that due process simply doesn't require a state to provide appellate review.</text>

            <text syncTime="940.239" offset="3896695">And these determinations affect a broad range of interests, including the welfare benefit situation in Ortwein, the situation in court martials proceedings, and in particular the decisions within the deportation system, because the Court recognizes that the crux of due process is you get a fair hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.881" offset="3983317">And the Court has held that a fair hearing is not established by proving that the decision of the fact finders was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.907" offset="4015396">In Tisi v. Todd, the Court specifically held that a wrong inference drawn from the evidence or if it is wrongly decided that evidence that has been introduced constituted legal evidence of a fact to be decided, the fact that these mistakes were made doesn't render that hearing unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.481" offset="4097629">And therefore, the Court in these areas has refused to grant review to the factual findings of the tribunals.</text>

Helms decision in which this Court, involving the transfer of an inmate to administrative segregation resulting in a curtailment of liberty within the prison system, held that due process was satisfied if the inmate gets notices of the reasons for the hearing, an opportunity to be heard, and the decisionmaker reviews the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.906" offset="4555399">There was no suggestion that there is an additional due process procedural requirement that judicial review of the legal sufficiency of the evidence upon which a transfer to decisions is based is an additional requirement of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.966" offset="4619556">Finally, in resolving the question of reviewability, I'd ask this Court to apply its traditional analysis and weigh the relative interest to the individual, to the state, and to balance the utility of judicial review against the burden that it would place upon the prison systems and indeed upon the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.208" offset="4696565">The due process clause is flexible and its scope depends on the context in which it is applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.834" offset="4719030">This Court has already acknowledged in Wolff the critical need to impose swift discipline in the prison system to ensure the safety of the other inmates as well as the guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.989" offset="4759676">The Court has already recognized that prison administrators have a better grasp of their domain than a reviewing judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.734" offset="4786635">And the members of a disciplinary board have as a matter of everyday experience knowledge of the particular physical structure of the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.260" offset="4820803">To require judicial review of the sufficiency of the evidence is then going to require introduction of evidence of facts within the common knowledge of the disciplinary board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.539" offset="4865943">For example, the record in this case establishes only that the assault took place at the west wing guard gate, yard gate No. 1; that the inmates were observed right away, jogging away down the walkway; and that they were the only inmates in the chain link area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.730" offset="4934697">Now, as a hypothetical matter, it may well be that the physical structure of that area would render it impossible for any other inmates to have committed the offense.</text>
