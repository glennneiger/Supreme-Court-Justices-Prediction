            <text syncTime="45.362" offset="323555">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="48.747" offset="337139">The issue for decision here today is whether the owner of a share account in a federal mutual savings and loan associations chartered by the federal government has a proprietary interest in that association.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.506" offset="400146">And the issue arises because of the merger of Commerce Savings and Loan Association, which was a guaranteed stock-type savings and loan association organized under the laws of the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.000" offset="458138">It merged with and into Citizens Federal Savings and Loan Association, which was a federal stock... nonstock-type mutual savings and loan association which was owned exclusively by the share account owners in the association.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.930" offset="537864">In the transaction, which qualified as a merger under state law, the assets and liabilities of Commerce were transferred to and merged with the assets and liabilities of Citizens Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.589" offset="596483">Citizens Federal was the surviving corporation in the merger, and in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, Commerce went out of existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.212" offset="634935">However, Citizens continued on carrying on the business... that of loaning money... that it had done prior to the merger, and also carried on the business that had been carried on by Commerce prior to the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.789" offset="685299">The shareholders of Commerce, including the Paulsens, who are the petitioners in this case, exchanged their stock in Commerce for share accounts in the mutual savings and loan association.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.548" offset="744336">The mutual association has only one form of equity, and that is the share memberships in its association, and that is what was transferred to the Paulsens in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.356" offset="791565">And they were represented by passbook and certificate accounts in Citizens Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.010" offset="818105">Thus, after the merger, the business of the two associations were carried on by one organization, and the owners of the two associations prior to the merger were the same owners of the merged association at the completion of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.785" offset="885292">The two associations and the petitioners in this case treated the merger as a tax-free reorganization under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.260" offset="931163">Therefore, no gain was recognized by Commerce on the transfer of its assets to Citizens Federal and no gain was recognized by the Paulsens on the transfer of their guaranteed stock in Commerce in exchange for the share accounts in Citizens Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.205" offset="1002948">The reorganization provisions of the Internal Revenue Code defer the recognition of gain on the transaction that qualifies as a reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.145" offset="1038683">Thus, until such time as Citizens Federal sold the assets which it acquired in the merger, it would not have any gain on the transaction, and until such time as the Paulsens liquidated their investment in Citizens Federal, they would not recognize any gain on the transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.439" offset="1107856">Would there be any justification on that latter point for taking the position that as soon as the time expired so that the Paulsens could withdraw the funds from the saving account that it would become taxable, as opposed to when they actually withdraw?</text>

            <text syncTime="258.301" offset="1175356">I don't think so, Your Honor, because the withdrawal of the savings account or what are termed savings account causes a loss of the rights that are conferred upon the Paulsens by the mutual savings and loan association; so that at the time they withdraw, then they lose the right to share in any further profits of the savings and loan association, and they lose the right to vote and the right to share in any proceeds upon the termination or liquidation of the mutual association.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.003" offset="1290086">The respondent asserted a deficiency against the petitioners, claiming that there was no reorganization, and therefore that gain had to be recognized by the Paulsens on the difference between their basis in the shares of the guarantee stock association which they exchanged for the passbook accounts in Citizens Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.583" offset="1380470">The case was taken to the tax court, and the tax court agreed with the petitioners and held that the merger of Commerce into Citizens was a reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code, and any gain that the Paulsens might have recognized would be deferred.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.001" offset="1482138">Judge Featherstone made the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.603" offset="1492483">The transaction the tax court analyzed met the statutory requirements set forth in the Code, and under the applicable provisions, a merger is included within the definition of a reorganization under Section 368.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.629" offset="1556639">And turning to Section 7701 of the Code, which provides the general definitions for applications throughout the Code, the following terms are included.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.420" offset="1595823">Corporation includes association.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.372" offset="1607630">Stock includes shares in an association.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.674" offset="1620796">And shareholder includes members in association.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.876" offset="1637619">Thus, Commerce transferred property to Citizens Federal, a mutual associations which under the terms of the Internal Revenue Code is a corporation; and therefore, no gain was recognized under Section 361 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.868" offset="1693625">Likewise, the petitioners exchanged stock in Commerce for passbook accounts in Citizens Federal, but under the definitions in the Code, those passbook accounts are shares and included in stock, and therefore would meet the requirements of the Code.</text>

            <text syncTime="421.024" offset="1826223">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="425.328" offset="1843464">In connection with the reorganization, the petitioners, the Paulsens, in this case transferred their stock in Commerce for share accounts in the Citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.533" offset="1884215">Under Section 7701, those share accounts are treated as stock, and therefore, there was an exchange of stock for stock, and no gain is recognized under Section 354 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.407" offset="1931758">However, in addition to the statutory language, it was necessary to meet certain judicially imposed requirements in order for there to be a reorganization, and those judicially imposed requirements make sure that the spirit of the law is carried out as well as the letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.636" offset="2000617">One of those tests is the continuity of proprietary interest test which distinguishes between pure sales of assets and those where the seller has a continuing proprietary interest in the transferee.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.795" offset="2057250">Thus, the owners of the acquired entity, Commerce, must have a continuing proprietary interest in the reorganized enterprise which is Citizens Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.234" offset="2099046">It is this test that the petition... that the respondent in this case claims that the petitioners did not meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.424" offset="2127781">This Court, in a series of landmark decisions nearly 50 years ago, defined what satisfies the continuity of proprietary interest test, and these cases are still used by the financial community today in determining when a reorganization exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.184" offset="2186817">In Letulle v. Scofield there was a transfer of assets for cash and notes, and the Court held that did not satisfy the continuity of interest test, because the only relationship the person transferring the assets to the continuing corporation had was that of a debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.609" offset="2248571">Likewise, in Pinellas Ice &amp; Cold Storage Company, there was a transfer of assets for cash and serial bonds which were secured by the assets which were transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.965" offset="2289949">This Court there held that there was not a sufficient equity interest in the transferee corporation because there still was only a debtor-creditor relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.255" offset="2327147">However, in Minnesota Tea v. Helvering, the receipt of voting trust certificates by this Court was held to satisfy the proprietary interest, and thus, a reorganization was allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.414" offset="2375735">In the Minnesota Tea case, the respondent argued that the petitioner in that case had given up common stock and only received back voting certificates, and therefore, there wasn't a good reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.888" offset="2429652">But the Court pointed out that the statute does not require a transferor to receive back the same equity interest that it gave up, as long as it has an equity interest in the continuing operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.982" offset="2482001">And likewise, on the same day this Court in John A. Nelson Company v. Helvering held that where a petitioner had transferred common... petitioner who had common stock and ended up with preferred stock which was nonvoting, redeemable, that there was a sufficient continuity of proprietary interest in the corporation which went on that there was a reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.215" offset="2590984">Thus, it is clear from these tests that an equity interest satisfies the continuity of interest test, and it must not be necessarily the same interest, equity interest which was give up as that received.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.540" offset="2644274">Debt, however, will not satisfy the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.659" offset="2656708">Therefore, the question comes down to the point of whether the interest received by the Paulsens in this case was an equity interest in the continuing corporation which was a Citizens... which was Citizens Federal, which was a federal mutual savings and loan association.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.120" offset="2722641">If the continuity of interest test is not met, the reorganization fails, and it is not tax-free either at the corporate level or at the shareholder level.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.828" offset="2765377">The tax court examined the nature of the interest received in this case by the petitioners and held that the petitioners had received an equity interest, not debt, that satisfied the continuity of interest test.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.236" offset="2819085">The tax court, in holding there was a reorganization, recognized the congressional intent to broadly apply the reorganization sections to encourage combinations of corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.443" offset="2867882">Looking at the Senate Finance Committee report accompanying the 1954 Act, it shows that the Senate had rejected a narrow definition of the term 7701 of the Code which provides the general definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.540" offset="2952310">It also looked back to the original Income Act of 1921 and there found that Congress sought to encourage combinations in reorganizations by allowing shareholders to receive interest in the ongoing corporation which had a readily realizable market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.722" offset="3036946">But so long as the transferring shareholder kept his money invested in that ongoing corporation and did not withdraw it, there was a valid reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.444" offset="3079892">The position of the respondent in this case is contrary both to the reorganization provisions and certainly to the protection and encouragement of savings and loan associations which Congress has sought to encourage over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.140" offset="3150631">By changing his position in 1969, the respondent has discriminated against mutual savings and loan association by not allowing them to be a party to a reorganization where a stock savings and loan association is merged into a mutual savings and loan association.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.619" offset="3228581">If reorganizations like this are not allowed, it has a harmful effect on the savings and loan industry, and, for instance, in this case if the reorganization is taxable at the corporate level and at the shareholder level, it takes away those funds which have been invested by the shareholders in a mutual savings and loan association and withdraws them from the market which makes available to homeowners mortgage loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.604" offset="3332548">The Ninth Circuit below reversed the tax court and found that the interest received by the Paulsens in this case constituted debt rather than a proprietary interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.328" offset="3379464">In doing so, that Ninth Circuit departed from an unbroken line of cases that had previously examined the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.582" offset="3408408">The court of claims in Capital Savings and Loan Association held that such an interest was an equity proprietary interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.386" offset="3435679">The Sixth Circuit in the West Side Federal also held that such an interest was a proprietary interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.723" offset="3456995">And in Everett v. the United States, the Tenth Circuit found not only was it proprietary interest, but it constituted voting stock under the more narrow definition as that term is used in the so-called C reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.732" offset="3517077">The tax court, of course, in Paulsen had reached the same result, and also in the subsequent case of Owens had found that there was a valid reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.755" offset="3549155">Also, two district courts have held that there had been a reorganization on the same facts... district courts in Wyoming and in the Northern District of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.594" offset="3584473">Also, the Ninth Circuit in the decision below ignored the cases decided by this Court which had examined the legal characteristics and the rights and obligations of a shareholder in a mutual saving and loan association.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.271" offset="3639225">And lastly, the Ninth Circuit misapplied the continuity of proprietary interest test set forth by this test in Minnesota Tea and John A. Nelson when it sought to compare the equity interest which the Paulsens received with the equity interest which they exchanged for their interest in Citizens Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.065" offset="3714354">This Court is certainly no stranger to the legal character of share accounts in a mutual savings and loan association.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.319" offset="3743402">In 1967 in Tcherepnin v. Knight, the issue was whether the owner of withdrawable share accounts in a savings and loan association could bring an action under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, a so-called 10(b)(5) action.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.281" offset="3807245">There, the court of appeals, like the Ninth Circuit and this Court, had found that the relationships of the owner of the share accounts was more like a debtor-creditor relationship than that of a stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.338" offset="3855415">This Court, however, reversed that holding and said that forms should be disregarded in substance... for substance, and emphasis should be placed on economic reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.044" offset="3898256">It noted that in a mutual savings and loan association, the petitioners, the investors in the association were engaged in a common enterprise: that of lending money.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.166" offset="3942768">And they relied on the skill and efforts of the management for return on their investment: for it there are no earnings and profits in the savings and loan association, there can be no dividends paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.326" offset="3995431">The Court found in reaching that... in making its determination that the following factors were present, and these factors are present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.448" offset="4031898">The share accounts carry with them a right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.217" offset="4042974">The shares represented all of the equity of the association.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.435" offset="4059901">The right to withdraw as a shareholder was subject to certain conditions, and the application to withdraw did not automatically make the withdrawing shareholder a creditor of the association.</text>

            <text syncTime="1318.633" offset="5416597">Well, I think that perhaps in certain circumstances that does exist, and there is a much litigated case, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board v. Elliot which involved a Long Peach savings and loan association, and when it was going to liquidate and there was a substantial surplus, there was a sudden influx of large depositors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.630" offset="5500607">The Federal Home Loan Bank Board felt that the board of directors of the company was not stepping in fast enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.617" offset="5524535">It came in and prohibited those large depositors from sharing in the proceeds upon the liquidation, although it actually subsequently changed to a... a merger with a guaranteed stock type association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.341" offset="5575421">But they were not allowed... the Federal Home Loan Bank Board cut off as a certain date the right to share in that... in the residual assets of the association when it was subsequently merged into a stock-type association to prevent, in effect, insider training, which is what happened in the Elliot case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.438" offset="5663820">Thus, in... in Tcherepnin, even without the guidance of a definition in the Securities and Exchange Act such as there is in the Internal Revenue Code that the shares do represent stock, this Court held that the share account holder could bring an action under 10(b)(5) and that such shares were stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.553" offset="5752323">The respondent seeks to characterize, and the Ninth Circuit unfortunately agreed, that the petitioners' relationship to Citizens is that of a depositor in a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.178" offset="5798821">However, as recently as 1982 this Court rejected by that analogy in Marine Bank v. Weaver, and in that case a depositor in a bank sought protection under Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and cited as precedent Tcherepnin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.490" offset="5872068">In that case this Court pointed out that Tcherepnin was a different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.793" offset="5893279">There, there was a mutual savings and loan association, and the share accounts carried with it the right to dividends based on profit, voting rights, and it was a stock situation, not a debtor-creditor relationship such as with a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.422" offset="5963810">Other courts have also looked at the relationship of a stock or a share account holder in a savings and loan association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.759" offset="5993172">In Wisconsin Bankers, decided by the D.C. circuit in 1961, an action was brought by an association of bankers who claimed that savings and loan associations were competing unfairly with banks because they allowed the share account holders to deposit money on what were called savings accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.441" offset="6079898">However, the court said that they were more concerned with the legal realities and not the appearances, and even though these were called savings accounts, they were really share accounts since the represented the capital of the association, and therefore, they were not violating or competing illegally with the banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.586" offset="6156489">The Ninth Circuit in its opinion below did not discuss one of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.307" offset="6175297">However... and dismissed in its decision the right to vote as having no value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.461" offset="6199957">It, directly contrary to the decisions and the discussion relating to the cases in Tcherepnin, it said that the dividend payments were precisely like interest and not distinguishable, and that the right to share proportionally in the residual value of the association had no value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.874" offset="6285639">We believe that these points are all... the Ninth Circuit was mistaken on each one of those points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.378" offset="6311657">The Ninth Circuit also misapplied the continuity of interest test in the decision below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1563.643" offset="6396711">Well, it has a value, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.409" offset="6407787">I think in Midwest Savings, a case that was cited which involved the merger of two mutual savings and loan associations, in order to equalize the value a 4 percent bonus dividend was declared by one of the associations just prior to the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.621" offset="6472571">In the Federal Home Loan Bank Board case versus Elliot there was a residual value which was recognized where the insiders tried to come in and claim a portion of that value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.144" offset="6510710">Russell, in his volume on savings and loan associations, talks about there being numerous liquidations of savings and loan associations at or above par during the thirty-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.970" offset="6562014">In Revenue Ruling 69649 cited in the brief, the respondent in that case... it was the merger of a federal mutual savings and loan association into a stock-type savings and loan association... and in that ruling the share account holders in the mutual received face value accounts in the stock-type association and then received guarantee stock for the residual value for the undistributed profits and the reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.704" offset="6676953">So there is a value there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.340" offset="6683431">The share account holders own that value and share proportionally in it if there is a merger or liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.178" offset="6718853">The Ninth Circuit, we believe, also misapplied the continuity of interest test in its decision below when it looked to the change in the proprietary interest received by the Paulsens in the reorganization to determine whether the test was met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.455" offset="6775905">In its opinion the court stated that there was little doubt that the passbook accounts are equity, since they represent the entire capital structure of the association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.727" offset="6816969">However, after making that observation, the court went on to say,</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.012" offset="6830135">"The critical question, however, is whether the position of the shareholder in the reorganized entity has really changed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.849" offset="6861482">"Has his risk increased or decreased? "</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.884" offset="6873603">"Is his investment more or less liquid? "</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.569" offset="6884365">"This, we suggest, is not the test. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.288" offset="6895232">"The only inquiry is whether a proprietary interest was received, not what kind of a proprietary interest was received. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.144" offset="6930654">As noted by this Court in Minnesota Tea and John A. Nelson, the relationship to the assets can change, but so long as there is a proprietary relationship with the ongoing corporation, there is a proprietary interest which meets the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.855" offset="7001498">The respondent, we believe, is also making the same incorrect comparison if you examine his published revenue rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.925" offset="7033785">In Revenue Ruling 69-3, which involved the merger of two mutual savings and loan associations, the respondent ruled that it was a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.102" offset="7086553">This is the same interest that the petitioners received in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.339" offset="7111421">If that ruling is right, how can this be stock for one purpose and not for another?</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.010" offset="7138171">In other words, the position of the respondent right now is that if there is a mutual... a merger of a mutual association into a mutual association, it is tax free; but if there is a merger of a stock association, such as in this case, into a mutual and the shareholders of the stock association exchange their stock for the only equity the mutual association can give the share accounts, it is not tax free.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.625" offset="7236600">We think this is inconsistent and wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.846" offset="7249452">Thus, the only question to be decided is whether the petitioners continued as owners of the reorganized enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.083" offset="7278396">Since passbook accounts by the Court's own concession are equity, we think this question has to be answered in the affirmative.</text>

            <text syncTime="1807.798" offset="7373273">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.667" offset="7388737">What happened here is that petitioners sold their stock for the equivalent cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.404" offset="7411725">We think they should be required to pay tax on their gain just as anybody else would have to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.725" offset="7437012">It might be helpful to begin with an analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.593" offset="7448505">Imagine a wise investor who buys stock in a corporation like IBM when it's still a new company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.182" offset="7478808">The company prospers, and the investor finds over time that his stock has quadrupled in value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.019" offset="7506184">At that time our wise investor might well decide that he had a great deal of wealth tied up in that relatively risky equity investment, that what has gone up might well come down, and that it would be prudent to take his profits and convert that relatively risky equity investment into a safer and more liquid form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.766" offset="7589149">Now, if our investor chose to do that by selling his stock on the open market for cash, he'd have to pay tax on his gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.022" offset="7618197">And the result would be the same if instead of selling his stock for cash, he sold it for short-term notes or bonds issued by any individual or by a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.561" offset="7660306">That's basically what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.929" offset="7669815">Petitioners bought stock in Commerce when it was a very new savings and loan company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.917" offset="7689772">The company prospered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.217" offset="7694997">By 1976, petitioners found that their stock, which they had paid $50,000 for, was now worth about $200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.875" offset="7733658">They may have thought this was a good time to sell their stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.843" offset="7749436">Interest rates had been declining for about two years at this period... at this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.879" offset="7765632">Savings and loans were doing very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.497" offset="7776081">Now, if petitioners chose to sell their stock for cash or for promissory notes to an individual or a corporation, they would have had to pay tax on their gain; and it would make no difference if they chose as a mechanism for selling their stock a statutory merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.958" offset="7849955">For example, if Commerce had merged into an ordinary corporation and petitioners gave up their stock and got back corporate bonds or promissory notes, they'd have to pay a tax on their gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.033" offset="7898230">If Commerce had merged into a commercial bank and petitioners gave up their stock and got back bank deposits, or savings accounts or CDs, they'd have to pay tax on their gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.658" offset="7944728">And if Commerce had merged into a stock savings and loan association, and petitioners gave up their stock and got back not stock, which would have been a relatively risky investment, but savings accounts, they would have had to pay tax on their gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.035" offset="8010243">The only question here, therefore, is whether the result should be different merely because the vehicle petitioners chose to cash out their investment was a merger not with a bank or with a stock savings and loan, but with a mutual savings and loan whose savings accounts happened to carry with them certain proprietary features like the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.516" offset="8096133">We submit such a difference in outcome is unjustifiable because those proprietary interests simply have no value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.204" offset="8126958">We think the entire case boils down to one simple proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.840" offset="8145452">It's clear that if petitioners had sold their stock for bank deposits, it would have had to pay tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.096" offset="8170530">There's no reason why the result should be different, that they should be able to avoid paying tax because they sold their stock for bank deposits plus something else where that something else has no economic value.</text>

            <text syncTime="2613.922" offset="10597828">I realize the reputation of the Internal Revenue Service is very technical and not necessarily always fair, and I would understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.527" offset="10632205">But here you have a case where since 1971 if a lawyer were advised or asked to advise a client, he would find that cases uniformly have taken a position contrary to the one you take here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.973" offset="10693959">I realize the Commissioner has never acquiesced in it, but what do people do when they wish to consider a measure, counsel tells them that five courts, including... well, the tax court would make six... have said that they may do so on a tax-free basis?</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.999" offset="10762086">And here they come along, and the Government says you've got to pay us some taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2661.588" offset="10788417">We were on the public record in 1969 as ruling that a stock into a mutual merger where the old shareholders are cashed out does not qualify for tax-free treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.210" offset="10834915">That ruling antedated all the court of appeals cases, and we kept litigating it in court after court; and now we finally won one, and that's why we're in this court, and you're the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.502" offset="10876084">And the fact that people may have relied on lower court opinions in the face of our obvious resistance doesn't set up any estoppel of alliance interest they can rely on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2728.614" offset="11056538">There was an in-house position which may have been reflected in some private letter rulings to the... to support the petitioners' position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.570" offset="11088408">But what happened in 1968 is that the Commissioner received a huge barrage of requests for private letter rulings as to the tax results of this kind of merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.960" offset="11133965">People wanted him to bless one of these mergers in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.662" offset="11148803">The reason for that, I think, is that between October of 1966 and August of '68 the value of savings and loan stocks as reflected in Standard 8 Poor's S&amp;L index quintupled in value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.989" offset="11206063">So you had an awful lot of shareholders in stock S&amp;Ls with a huge unrealized gain on their stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.326" offset="11231454">They wanted to merge and cash out their investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.262" offset="11243157">The Commissioner got this huge influx of requests for private rulings, and the rulings branch of the IRS realized that the Commissioner had not looked at this area for a long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.402" offset="11287670">During the interim, up until '69, as we note in our brief, there'd been a long series of congressional amendments to the both banking and regulatory and tax treatment of S&amp;Ls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.060" offset="11338347">They were tax exempt until 1951, and Congress gradually began an incremental process changing the way they were treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.166" offset="11370739">At the same time, their economic function changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.268" offset="11383173">They became less and less like true mutual organizations and more and more like banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.570" offset="11400414">That's reflected in the legislative treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.522" offset="11408146">So what happened was the Commissioner got this huge bunch of ruling requests and decided it was a good time to review the area authoritatively in light of all the changes that had occurred on the congressional front, and he did so and issued the three rulings in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.698" offset="11468855">And I think that this is simply a reasoned response to changes in the economy and in the way Congress treated these organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.454" offset="11499888">They are really not like... like true mutual organizations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.364" offset="13543604">I'd like to point out first of all that the Commissioner has publicly ruled that the vast majority of S&amp;L mergers can be done tax free; that is, mutual to mutual, mutual to stock, and stock into stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.457" offset="13595954">Furthermore, Commerce here, had they wanted to merge tax free, could have had Citizens convert to a stock form of organization, which would have been tax free, and then do a stock-for-stock transaction.</text>
