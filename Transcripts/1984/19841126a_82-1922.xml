            <label>Mr. Allen I. Hirsch</label>
            <text syncTime="78.219" offset="438782">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, while there are many directions one can take when answering the question posed by this case in a manner which would be favorable to the petitioners, the question itself, we believe, is rather simply put: Does a state's clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed policy to displace competition with a mandatory and pervasive regulatory system which it actively supervises shield from antitrust liability the private regulated parties acting in a manner contemplated and authorized but not literally compelled by the state system?</text>
            <text syncTime="126.154" offset="630521">In order to answer this question, it is useful not only to examine the state action doctrine as it commenced with Parker v. Brown and as it has been discussed by this Court in subsequent opinions, but to look closely at the underlying concept of federalism upon which Parker v. Brown was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.644" offset="712441">To begin this examination, we should look briefly at the state regulatory systems as well as the pertinent federal statutes in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.532" offset="752043">Each state in this case has legislatively mandated regulation of motor carriers with pervasive regulatory schemes setting forth what the motor carrier operators must do in order to comply with the state schemes and in order to be motor carriers within the state bounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.691" offset="864683">Each state has established a public service commission to administer that regulation in order to achieve these legislatively articulated purposes and goals for the benefit of the public and the citizens of those states.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.247" offset="942841">On the federal level, at the same time, the Congress of the United States first in 1935 specifically reserved to the states the right to regulate motor carriers within their state boundaries, and subsequently in 1948 the Congress of the United States specifically exempted activity which if not identical is very, very similar when engaged in by interstate motor carriers subject to the regulation of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.401" offset="1119533">The unique aspect of this case is that under the federal scheme, in order to avail oneself of the exemption from the federal antitrust laws, carriers had to petition the Interstate Commerce Commission for a collective agreement, and in order to receive the exemption by use of this agreement, they had to reserve the right to independent action by each of the carriers who were parties to the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.215" offset="1258714">What the government proposes in this situation is that contrary to the federal scheme which required the reservation of the right to independent action in order to obtain relief from the antitrust laws, that the states, because they do not remove that right, because they do not compel collective activity, but only allow and authorize collective activity while still allowing this independent action, have lost the right to exemption from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.762" offset="1412941">We submit that in the context of this case, pervasive regulatory schemes coupled with this federal background of an explicit reservation to the states of the right to regulate in this area, and Congressional action in the same arena attempting to accomplish the same goals, and not to allow the states to do the same, is to stand the doctrine of federalism on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.234" offset="1530805">Now, under the doctrine of federalism as addressed in Parker v. Brown, this Court has stated in the oft quoted phrase that when we are dealing in a system of dual sovereignty, where the federal government is a sovereign and the state is a sovereign, it is not easily to be implied that the federal government has intended to remove the state right to act and to subject it to federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.817" offset="1657133">In this case when we couple this proposition of the Parker case with the specific reservation of the right to the states to regulate in this area, we believe that this substantiates the position that the federal Congress does not intend to apply the Sherman Act in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.946" offset="1761623">In Parker you had no statement of a reservation of rights to the states to regulate their agricultural crops.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.896" offset="1797463">They went ahead and regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.020" offset="1805927">In fact, in Parker there was federal legislation which was comparable to the regulation that was being engaged in by the state itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.609" offset="1844275">In this case, we don't deal with just the silence of the Congress of the United States in the Sherman Act with respect to its applicability to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.965" offset="1881787">We deal with the subsequent explicit statement of the intent of the Congress of the United States not to apply the federal laws to the states when it comes to the regulation of motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.928" offset="1933613">In this arena, we then turn to the state action doctrine, and see if the doctrine as evolved by this Court does apply in fact to the regulatory schemes of the states we have before you.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.941" offset="2417610">Under that scheme, the states have then further said, we wish to assist the public service commission in realizing this ratesetting charge that we have given them, that we have delegated to the public service commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.264" offset="2630978">Now, what the government says is solely because the states also at the same time intend to allow a carrier who is dissident or disagrees with the information or the rate that results from the collective activity can come forward with his own information or his own proposal for whatever specific reasons as may have and underlying these reasons are certainly those areas of anticompetitive conduct that the states don't intend to authorize or approve, such as coercion refusal to interline.</text>

            <text syncTime="869.275" offset="3602942">And this is why we contend that the Parker doctrine, when we sift under the verbiage and the words that have come down in the various cases as applied to the specific fact situation in each case, and the Court surely recognizes, as the Chief Justice pointed out in his concurring opinion in City of Lafayette, this area is evolving.</text>

            <text syncTime="905.323" offset="3747138">And while the term v.

            <text syncTime="938.341" offset="3879213">Would it be your view that even if Congress had not passed the Reed Bullwinkle Act in 1948 that your argument would be equally strong?</text>

            <text syncTime="947.399" offset="3915471">I saw, all I address the Feed Bullwinkle Act for is to add one more rung to the federalism ladder, because if federalism in total Congressional silence still means that Congress does not intend to displace the right of the state as sovereign to enact laws within its bounds, then surely when Congress later speaks in the same area and does that which the states do, it is absurd to argue that under a federalism doctrine they can prohibit the states from doing just what they are doing, that coupled with the fact that they have already said, we are going to leave you alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.570" offset="4088193">Now, the government points at this and says, it was Congressional intent to allow the antitrust laws to continue to apply to states, and that could be inferred from the fact that they did not give the exemption stated in the Reed Bullwinkle bill to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.750" offset="4152872">And I again say, much as the silence with respect to the Sherman Act is not to be inferred to apply to the states as sovereign, neither is the silence in Congress in giving the exemption only on the federal level to be implied that that exemption is unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.150" offset="4218492">What it says to us is that Congress had already reserved the right to the state to regulate this area, and we are not going to interfere with their rates, so therefore we are not going to go in and tell them whether they are exempt or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.677" offset="4268647">That is within the right of the state as a sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.191" offset="4278678">And the states responded by enacting this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.782" offset="4296964">The most recent... not the most recent case, but the most recent synthesis of the state action doctrine, of course, occurred in the Mid-Cal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.603" offset="4376271">This case came up while this case was in the appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.554" offset="4400095">In Mid-Cal, we find it to be very clear that this Court, after going through each of the state action cases which preceded it and discussing the specific holdings found in very definite language that the result of all the state action cases was a two-pronged test, clear articulation of an affirmative intent to displace competition coupled with active supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.978" offset="4525796">Nowhere in Mid-Cal does it say that by the way there will be a separate test for private regulated parties responding to the regulatory schemes of their states, and they must be compelled, nor does it say that there are private or different tests for anyone who comes before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.577" offset="4612209">The only differentiation that has been reached and made more explicit was in Hoover versus Ronwin, in which this Court said, when the activity is in fact the activity of the state itself, and the state is the very actor, that is the end of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.181" offset="4678560">We will not attack the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.259" offset="4690890">But if the actor be a non-sovereign, then we apply the Mid-Cal test, and we submit that the Mid-Cal test has been met, as Judge Hill said both in his dissent in the three-judge Court of Appeals and in his dissenting opinion in the en banc hearing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.999" offset="4777930">Whether he agrees with the majority's feelings that the activity in question may be anticompetitive is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.963" offset="4821711">The issue is what this Court has said, and this Court has stated a two-pronged standard, and the carriers in this situation, the regulatory schemes in this situation meet that two-pronged standard thoroughly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1258.352" offset="5159318">What was the occurring in that case, the reason that case came before this Court was that by reason of coercion and reasons of refusing to interline or exchange cargoes with railroads in the south and railroads in the north, the south was being charged a discriminatory rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.359" offset="5239357">As a matter of fact, the regulatory schemes as they now exist address some of those very problems, the discrimination that was resulting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.045" offset="5270077">I believe Georgia versus Pennsylvania Railroad emphasizes... the underlying factual background, emphasizes the need for regulation, both on the inter and intrastate level in this area, because it was being abused, and there was an entire section of the country which was being discriminated against in its rates because of abuse of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.474" offset="5351788">These abuses which occurred in the Georgia v. Pennsylvania Railroad context cannot occur because of the second prong of Mid-Cal, which is the active state supervision of the activity in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.138" offset="5414482">It will be argued, I am sure, that the Reed Bullwinkle bill was an attempt to eliminate this Court's determination that collective ratemaking was a per se violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.773" offset="5476967">What the legislative history of that bill specifically says is that it is designed to remove the questions raised by Georgia versus Pennsylvania Railroad, to clear the air, not to reverse this Court, not to change this Court, but say questions have been raised, and therefore under this context if you have an agreement approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission and you reserve the right to independent action, then you are entitled to an exemption from the antitrust laws because you are a regulated industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.385" offset="5599429">The states who had engaged in this same type of practice and regulation came forward and have subsequently issued their own state regulatory schemes which address the same problems, and the result is that they have clearly articulated the intent to allow the activity in question as long as the independent carrier has the right to file independently, and they police any abuses of this system either in a collective nature or in an individual nature or in the use of coercion by pervasively regulating and actively supervising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.963" offset="5761702">The bottom line is, as I believe Justice Powell said in Hoover versus Ronwin, conspire as they will, the carriers in this case can do nothing without the subsequent review and approval of the state commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.861" offset="5861280">They can sit around and agree on every price, every rate, everything they want to agree on, and when they walk away from that room, they have accomplished nothing other than reaching an agreement to present to the public service commissions for hearing, for review, for requests for additional information, and after that hearing and after that review, the public service commissions meet and they set the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.129" offset="5978413">Every one of the state statutes is clear in that instance that it is not the carriers who are setting the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.971" offset="6001819">It is the public service commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.798" offset="6009029">That, the rate itself, is the act of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.187" offset="6022613">I likewise submit for those same reasons that were the party before this Court today the public service commissions, who are represented in an intervenor capacity by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, this Court nor the lower courts could have found them to be in violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.474" offset="6111742">So, this clearly emphasizes the position that if the regulatory commissions are not violating the antitrust laws, that merely because those responding to the regulation and subjecting themselves to the regulation because they are mandated to subject themselves to the regulation can be violating the antitrust laws is again classifying Parker v. Brown as a case standing for nothing more, as Justice Stewart pointed out in his dissent in Cantor, nothing more than the proposition that Porter Brown sued the wrong party.</text>

          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="1612.022" stopTime="2300.368">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="1612.022" offset="6574005">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court... forgive my cold... one of the concerns manifested in the legislative history of the Sherman Act and that prompted the Act's passage was concern over price collusion in railroad rates that was then prevalent, and railroads were at that time the predominant form of freight transportation in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.697" offset="6696676">The very first Sherman Act cases to reach this Court were two suits by the United States under Section 1 of the Sherman Act to enjoin railroad cartel practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.457" offset="6763759">These were United States against Trans-Missouri Freight Association, 166 US in 1897, and United States against Joint Traffic Association, 171 US in 1898.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.091" offset="6826244">In both cases the Court ruled that the United States was entitled to an injunction against these practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.227" offset="6862815">In the Trans-Missouri case it was a cartel created by 18 railroads which provided service west of the Mississippi, and Joint Traffic was a similar cartel among lines serving between Chicago and the east coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.252" offset="6922897">And they had through the cartel promulgated a freight rate structure to which they would all adhere, although they could compete among themselves by means other than rate competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.966" offset="6973783">Well, there are, of course, differences between those cases and this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.463" offset="7003772">The present suit by the government to enjoin price collusion in the now dominant field of motor carrier freight transportation is in the tradition of these earlier cases, and like the earlier cases, our suit reflects not just concern about the familiar evils of price collusion among competitors, but the particular economic concern about the ripple effects of price competition in a service industry like freight transportation, ripples which can be intensified as they are added to at various stages of the process of manufacturing and distributing goods, if the price is increased of getting supplies to the manufacturer, getting the manufactured goods to the wholesaler, of getting the goods from the distributor to the retailer, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.159" offset="7234485">Now, we saw a very dramatic example of these ripple effects in a comparable situation during the time of rapid price rises in the cost of energy imposed by the OPEC cartel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.933" offset="7301672">Here we are dealing with a much more limited economic effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.103" offset="7318286">It is what this Court recognized in Georgia against the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.351" offset="7335318">It is price collusion within the zone of reasonableness for regulated rates, but nonetheless it is a matter of considerable economic concern, and the Justice Department has investigations in other geographic areas, and the Federal Trade Commission has also acted in this field now, and three amicus briefs have been filed in our support in this Court, two by associations of shippers and one by a group of state attorneys general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.042" offset="7458093">And we are talking about something of considerable economic effect, and the point of my introducing the subject this way is that it is in a context not at the periphery, but at the very heart of Shermar Act concerns that the petitioners here who can claim no express exemption from the antitrust laws are asking this Court to take a more generous view of the implied exemption for state action than has heretofore been established in this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.369" offset="7619321">And I want to make very clear that they are not claiming and cannot claim an express exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.773" offset="7645026">Reference has been made to the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, which was the first federal law that conferred authority on the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate motor carrier rates at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.486" offset="7711795">By that time, under this Court's Shreveport decision, the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission had been extended to intrastate railroad rates that could affect interstate commerce, and Congress decided in 1935 to confine the newly conferred rate regulation authority on the Interstate Commerce Commission to the field of interstate rates, and to leave rate regulation over intrastate rates to state public utility commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.252" offset="7862887">There was no mention for interstate or intrastate rates of any exemption from the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.233" offset="7898831">There was no delegation to the states comparable to the McCarren-Ferguson Act that would have exempted expressly any practices from the Sherman Act, and indeed ten years later this Court in the Georgia case held that the 1935 Act did not confer an implied immunity even with respect to interstate rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.204" offset="8010740">That was a case heard on motion for leave to file a bill of complaint, and one of the grounds on which that motion was opposed was that the bill of complaint did not state a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.044" offset="8066015">Because of rate regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission, there was no cause of action left under the Sherman Act, and this Court explicitly in a section devoted to the cause of action question rejected that claim, which gave rise to the Reed Bullwinkle Act, which again had no express provision with respect to state rate regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.063" offset="8174162">Now, another irony of the claim for an exemption here is that it comes just at a time when Congress in the 1980 Motor Carrier Act, which we have described in some detail on Page 32 of our brief and in the footnote there has eliminated in large part the exemptions for rate collusion in interstate rates that existed under Reed Bullwinkle with respect to interstate motor freight transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.845" offset="8325254">With very limited exceptions, the Interstate Commerce Commission can no longer confer exemption for price collusion with respect to single line rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.387" offset="8371439">Much of the discussion about the previous scheme that was featured in the courts below and in the briefs is quite outmoded since these provisions have taken effect in July of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.944" offset="8417623">And indeed, even though the Act reserves the ability of two carriers to agree on a joint rate as a joint venture between themselves, it even eliminates the exemption for collusion about joint rates between two different groups of carriers offering the same joint rate between two points for the same commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.169" offset="8522531">So, there is considerable irony in the plea that it is necessary to take a generous view of the exemption in order to have something commensurate at the state level with what we have with respect to interstate motor traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.269" offset="8606959">The motor carrier freight industry is a $150 billion annual industry in this country, and it is a matter of considerable economic concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.014" offset="8657950">This is what our... I can't give you a breakdown between interstate and intrastate, but the total, according to our most recent studies, is that we are dealing with a $150 billion industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.822" offset="8705179">Now, with this background, I would like to turn to the question of the legal standard under Parker that governs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.551" offset="8752095">Parker is based on dual principles of federalism stated by the Court in Parker itself that the Sherman Act broadly prohibits restraints of trade imposed by individuals and corporations but was not intended to prohibit state action or official action directed by a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.086" offset="8866198">Now, in the Court's previous decisions, there has been much discussion of criteria, and we have rehearsed that in some detail in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.988" offset="8925862">The Court has stated that the action, when we are talking about action of private individuals, has to be something required by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.123" offset="8966404">It has talked about compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.186" offset="8974658">It has said that the Court has rejected the idea that state authorization, approval, encouragement, or participation or prompting of the privately imposed restraint won't suffice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.476" offset="9043831">It has rejected those criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.630" offset="9052399">And this has given rise, in accordance with the tendency in this country for an elaborately legalistic federalism that sometimes confuses people from elsewhere, it has given rise to discussion by the commentators about possible refinements of the meaning of all these terms, including compulsion, which in our view tend to obscure as much as illuminate what is the basic question in these cases, and that is the intensely practical question that the Court addressed in Cantor, namely, who is it who exercises the choice under the state scheme, who exercises the choice between competition and collusion?</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.968" offset="9261796">Is that choice made by private parties acting in their own economic self-interest, or is that choice made by the state acting in the public interest as part of a regulatory program that it is imposing?</text>

            <text syncTime="2511.597" offset="10172320">The practical answer is that the states have hesitated to go that far because there are competing economic interests being asserted in these states as they are being asserted in this Court, and the states have temporized on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.121" offset="10230417">It is not essential to the states' view of the public interest that there be collusion in freight rates, although they have permitted it within the zone of reasonableness under these schemes, and it by no means will automatically follow if the Court agrees with our position in this case that the states will then seriatim in any large numbers require rate collusion by intrastate carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.421" offset="10359566">And if they did, then Congress would have to consider whether it would want to override that state judgment, just as it has overridden what it had previously authorized under Reed Bullwinkle in both the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 and with respect to railroads in the Harley Staggers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.475" offset="10439814">The other answer is that I think the same result really is reached whether we talk about it as compulsion or whether we talk about it as whether there is a clearly articulated state policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2597.421" offset="10515569">If the only clearly articulated state policy is that they would rather have the decision whether there will be competition or collusion made by private persons operating in their economic self-interest rather than made by Congress, that is not something that this Court has ever said is protected by the Parker doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="2843.586" offset="11500281">He was fond of saying that this Court's Trenton Potteries decision condemned price fixing among competitors as illegal because it was a form of private taxation imposed by private persons for private purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3245.487" offset="13107857">That is correct, but the states have said that absent the collective activity, they could not regulate.</text>

            <label>Mr. Allen I. Hirsch</label>
            <text syncTime="3266.727" offset="13192807">That is a very close question, and it may vary with regard to each state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.193" offset="13226662">I would say that in general the mandate of the state for the regulatory procedures came before the collective activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.879" offset="13249440">Of course, the collective activity in the railroad industry predates the motor carrier industry, but the Motor Carrier Acts themselves in the states began anywhere from the 1920's up to the 1940's, and it is a very close parallel as to on a state-by-state basis which one is actually the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.887" offset="13317463">I would also say that the... in response to the Cantor question, my brother stated that participation of the state is not enough, and I concur with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.444" offset="13371693">The fallacy of Cantor under a Mid-Cal approach is that there is not a clearly articulated state policy regarding lightbulbs, and in this case there is a clearly articulated policy regarding rates, and it is pervasively and actively supervised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.703" offset="13428745">I also question how active the supervision was with respect to the lightbulbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.406" offset="13443478">The other interesting point my brother makes is that at the time this case was filed, no state had statutes regarding the specific activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.354" offset="13479318">Is this not the clearest articulation of their intent to have a combination of collective activity and independent activity by the fact that they came forward in light of this case and enacted state legislation dealing with this specific area, and restating, we desire both?</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.723" offset="13548804">In conclusion, I submit to the Court that no one, not the parties or the courts below, question this clear articulation or legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.813" offset="13581091">No one, not the courts below or the parties, question the active supervision.</text>
