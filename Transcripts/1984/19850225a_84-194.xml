            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="67.977" offset="398487">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="70.929" offset="410295">This case arises out of a rather unfortunate incident that occurred in New Mexico in 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.166" offset="439238">Andrew Heard, who was a soldier in the United States Army stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas, murdered Vernon Shearer, who was also a soldier stationed at Fort Bliss, when both men were off base and off duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.693" offset="501305">And Heard was later sentenced to 15 to 55 years in prison in the state court for second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.264" offset="527637">Now, thereafter, Shearer's mother, who is the Respondent in this Court, sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act seeking damages for her son's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.071" offset="574866">Respondent alleged that Heard had certain well-known dangerous propensities, and that the Army's negligent failure to control him, or to discharge him from the military, or to warn other soldiers about him was the cause of Shearer's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.766" offset="641635">The Government moved for summary judgment on the basis of two exceptions to the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.955" offset="670370">One is the intentional tort exception in Section 2680(h) of Title VIII, and the other is the Feres doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.793" offset="701717">The district court granted the Government's motion for summary judgment, but a divided court of appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.214" offset="731392">The Third Circuit held that Respondent's suit was not barred by the intentional tort exception because her complaint was framed in terms of negligence, and the court held that it was not barred by the Feres doctrine because Shearer's injuries had not occurred, in the court's view, incident to his military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.943" offset="810282">Now, we sought certiorari because we believe that these rulings are plainly erroneous and conflict with numerous other decisions construing the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.234" offset="851451">Now, I'd like to begin by discussing the intentional tort exception first, because we believe that the plain language of that provision on its face unquestionably disposes of Respondent's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.827" offset="905890">The Tort Claims Act by its terms does not apply to any claim</text>
            <text syncTime="200.731" offset="929505">"arising out of certain intentional torts, including assault and battery. "</text>
            <text syncTime="206.116" offset="951029">Now, there can't really be much doubt, we believe, that Respondent's claim here clearly arises out of Heard's assault and battery within the ordinary meaning of that phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.674" offset="997214">Heard's assault and battery directly gave rise to the injuries suffered by Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.542" offset="1016754">Respondent unquestionably would have no cause of action if it wasn't for Heard's assault and battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.713" offset="1041413">And the damages that she seeks here are precisely those damages that arose from the assault and battery, no more and no less.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.219" offset="1075477">Her claim, therefore, we believe falls within the literal language of the intentional tort exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.055" offset="1098778">Now, the court of appeals attempted to avoid the straightforward language of Section 2680(h) by pointing out that Respondent's claim is drafted in terms of negligence rather than directly charging the Government with assault and battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.899" offset="1162099">It is undoubtedly true that Respondent, with an eye on Section 2680(h), has framed her complaint here to charge negligence rather than directly charge assault and battery; but we believe that a plaintiff's drafting decision plainly can't control the waiver of sovereign immunity that Congress has placed in the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.664" offset="1249243">It is a crucial--</text>

            <text syncTime="283.616" offset="1261051">Supposing we take it out of the military context for a moment and put it in a federal prison, and there was an allegation of negligence in administering the discipline and all the rest of the prison, and that one inmate assaulted another inmate due to the negligence in supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.476" offset="1320505">Is that within the exemption or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="325.108" offset="1426981">And what we think Congress was obviously focusing on was arising out of assault and battery by a federal employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.813" offset="1461776">If it was a federal employee, we think it would be covered by Section 2680(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="338.284" offset="1479643">There's a line of cases, however, where one inmate assaults another inmate, and we have not contended that that would be covered by Section 2680(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="346.538" offset="1512662">I think the distinction is one that Justice Harlan when he was a member of the Second Circuit drew, and we think quite reasonably so, in the Panella case; and that is something that has been followed by many of the subsequent courts.</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="359.948" offset="1566370">You would read the arising out of language to mean arising out of an assault by a federal employee.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="364.066" stopTime="633.172">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="364.066" offset="1582775">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.333" offset="1583924">We think the whole Tort Claims Act is only talking about what should flow from torts by federal employees, what consequences should flow from torts by federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.022" offset="1618615">And therefore, we think Section 2680(h) should be read at a minimum to bar suits against the United States arising out of assaults and batteries by federal employees, and therefore, the Court in this case needn't address what the situation would be if the assault was by a non-employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.300" offset="1687787">Now, as I was saying, the crucial language of the Tort Claims Act says not that the United States cannot be sued for assault and battery; it says the United States cannot be sued for any claim arising out of assault and battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.493" offset="1752571">And Congress presumably chose this broader language for a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.714" offset="1769394">We think the reason was that it wanted to avoid the federal Treasury's having to pay any claim that requires proof of an intentional tort by a federal employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.188" offset="1815265">In fact, negligence supervision claims such as the one that Respondent has tried to bring here would seem to be precisely the sort of claim that arises out of an assault and battery but perhaps does not fall within wording such as for assault and battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.000" offset="1886527">So we think that unless Congress' choice of language... and it was a deliberate choice of language... is to be accorded no significance, then Section 2680(h) has to be read to cover claims like Respondent's that sound in torts other than assault and battery but plainly arise out of assault and battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.695" offset="1961341">And if there were any real doubt that this was the correct interpretation of the exemptions to the Tort Claims Act, I think it was dispelled by the Court's decision last term in the Kosak case.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.669" offset="2005227">Now, the Court will recall that Kosak involved a parallel exception to the Tort Claims Act, Section 2680(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="477.156" offset="2035216">That section bars claims against the United States in respect of the detention of goods by Customs officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.695" offset="2069384">The plaintiff in Kosak, like the Respondent here, argued for a very narrow construction of Section 2680(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="494.035" offset="2102716">The plaintiff in Kosak argued that the Congress only meant to bar claims for damages that relate directly to the detention of goods and didn't mean to cover suits that challenge the loss or destruction of goods in the course of a Customs detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.762" offset="2169589">But this Court rejected that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.246" offset="2179516">It did so by looking at the plain language that Congress used.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.900" offset="2194145">It said that Congress didn't simply bar claims for the detention of goods by Customs officials; it barred claims in respect of the detention of goods by Customs officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.022" offset="2234687">And the Court said that in respect of has the same broad and all-encompassing meaning that words such as 2680(h), have.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.230" offset="2279513">And therefore, the Court said that Congress intended to bar suits against the United States, in the Court's words, in any way associated with the detention of goods, including the plaintiff's claim in Kosak.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.239" offset="2335519">There's no reason why Section 2680(h) should be given a narrower reading than Section 2680(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="559.993" offset="2366553">Section 2680(h) has the arising out of language that the Court in Kosak analogized Section 2680(c) to.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.249" offset="2399572">Therefore, we think in light of the Court's decision in Kosak, Section 2680(h) has to bar claims that are in any way associated with an assault and battery by a federal employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.073" offset="2450876">In fact, the way that the court of appeals construed Section 2680(h) is really quite perverse, because what the court of appeals essentially said is that the only species of claim that it bars is a claim trying to hold the United States liable on a respondeat superior basis for the intentional torts of its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.320" offset="2539797">But there really was very little reason why Congress should have been concerned when it passed the Tort Claims Act in 1946 that the United States would be held liable on a respondeat superior basis for intentional torts, because it was very unusual in 1946, and it's still unusual today, for an employer to be held liable on a respondeat superior basis for the intentional torts of its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.285" offset="2643660">And Congress had already put into Section 1346(b)--</text>

            <text syncTime="672.047" offset="2814709">--We would think, Mr. Chief Justice, that both suits would be barred if the cause of action was dependent upon proving an intentional tort by a federal employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.355" offset="2859954">And in both of your hypotheticals I think that would be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.823" offset="2877821">In other words, we don't think it matters whether the federal employee was acting within the scope of his employment of not.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.544" offset="2904780">If it is essential to the plaintiff's case to prove an intentional tort by a federal employee, we think Congress meant to foreclose suits against the United States under 2680(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="707.386" offset="2956084">However, we don't believe that it necessarily would extend to suits challenging intentional torts by non-employees such as I discussed with Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.944" offset="3002373">So as I was saying, the only thing that would be covered by the Third Circuit's construction of Section 2680(h) are respondeat superior claims, but that was really not a problem that Congress could have been concerned about in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.121" offset="3063082">If it had locked at the reported cases involving intentional torts by employees, it would have seen that most of those suits alleged a negligent supervision theory, and yet, there's nothing in the language or legislative history of the intentional tort exception to suggest that Congress meant to foreclose suits based on the really less likely theory, which is respondeat superior, and allow the United States to be sued on the more likely theory, which is negligent supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.223" offset="3179483">And I think that Congress' amendment of the Tort Claims Act, the intentional tort exception, in 1974 confirms this common understanding of the clause, because as the Court is aware, Congress amended the Tort Claims Act in 1974 to allow the United States to be sued for the intentional torts of law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.053" offset="3266732">And that amendment followed a series of well-publicized episodes in which law enforcement officers, primarily drug agents, had engaged in illegal searches and seizures, no-knock raids, and illegal arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.663" offset="3329217">If there was any species of claim in which it would be plausible or would have been plausible to hold the United States liable on a negligence supervision theory, that was it, because the evidence showed that many of these illegal raids had been carried out by the same drug officials or the same drug offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.042" offset="3402674">And yet, the legislative history of the 1974 amendments are quite clear that Congress amended the act based on the assumption, which was shared by everyone and disputed by no one, that prior to the amendment in 1974 the United States could not have been sued by the victims of those raids because of the intentional tort exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.823" offset="3493893">And so I think for all of these reasons, the Third Circuit was quite wrong to deviate from the plain language of Section 2680(h) in holding that this suit was not barred by the intentional tort exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.381" offset="3540078">Now, I would like to turn briefly to our Feres argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.400" offset="3556169">We think that for the reasons I have just stated it is inconceivable that Congress could have intended to allow a plaintiff to circumvent the all-encompassing language of the intentional tort exception by the simple expedient of framing a complaint that sounds negligence by plainly is seeking damages from the United States based on an intentional tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.848" offset="3649896">Nonetheless, Respondent has done precisely that here, and we think that as a result, her complaint runs squarely up against the Feres doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.490" offset="3688558">Now, under this Court's decision in Feres, a serviceman can't sue the United States under the Tort Claims Act for injuries that arise out of or in the course of his military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.631" offset="3741116">The Court has explained that the Feres doctrine is based principally on the special relationship between a solider and his superior officers, and it is designed to prevent the adverse effect on military discipline that would occur if soldiers could challenge the decisions of their superior officers in court in the guise of tort claims litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.579" offset="3828887">It's really hard to imagine a case that more directly implicates the Feres doctrine than this one, and I invite the Court to take a look at the allegations of Respondent's complaint to see precisely what I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.471" offset="3880401">The crucial allegations are at page 14 of the joint appendix, paragraphs 40 and 41 of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.842" offset="3917913">And the Court will see in paragraphs 40 and 41 that Respondent here alleges that Private Shearer's superior officers at Fort Bliss were negligent in failure to exert more control over Private Heard, a fellow solider at the base, in failing to remove Private Heard from active duty, in failing to prevent Private Heard from injuring his fellow soldiers on the base, and in failing to warn those soldiers of the special danger that Private Heard presented to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.500" offset="4052600">So what we have here is a tort claims act suit by a soldier that's unabashedly intended to hail his superior officers into court to defend against charges that they were negligent in the way that they controlled or refused to discipline or refused to dismiss from the military some fellow soldier who was at the same base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.329" offset="4143820">Now, I ask the Court would it... would a suit like this require a civilian court to referee disputes involving military personnel?</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.237" offset="4183526">Would it require a court to intrude into the special relationship between a soldier and his superior officers?</text>

            <text syncTime="1195.954" offset="4910357">Now, there's one other point that bears mentioning in this regard, and that's this: when the Third Circuit rejected the Government's intentional tort argument, what it said was that the basis of Respondent's claim wasn't the intentional tort by Heard; it was instead... the basis of Respondent's claim instead was the actions of Private Shearer's superior officers at Fort Bliss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.503" offset="5008577">And yet, when the Court of Appeals considered the Government's Feres claim, it quickly switched gears and totally reanalyzed Respondent's suit, and said in that context that what Respondent was challenging was not the actions of Private Shearer's superiors but what had happened off base when Heard assaulted Shearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.685" offset="5093318">Now, this is a bit of a shell game, we think; when we find the pea, the court moved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.554" offset="5112754">It's obvious that Respondent can't have it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.606" offset="5124979">She can't say that the basis of her suit is the negligence by private Shearer's military superiors when it suits her purposes under Section 2680(h), and then when the Government challenges her suit under the Feres doctrine say oh, no, we're not really challenging the actions of military superiors; we're challenging what happened off base when Private Heard assaulted Private Shearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.256" offset="5227588">So we think for both of these reasons the court of appeals was quite wrong in reversing the district court's grant of summary judgment for the Government, and we would ask this Court to reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.718" offset="5413475">Section 2680(h) of the Federal Tort Claims Act, the intentional tort exception, bars recovery where a claim arises out of assault and battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.307" offset="5451823">The Government urges that this exception should engulf not only respondeat superior claims, but also claims founded in antecedent negligence, regardless of how dire or severe that negligence predicate is, whenever the intervening tort feasor is a government employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.988" offset="5526533">The court of appeals determined that where an intervening intentional tort arises proximately, predictably and foreseeably, antecedent negligence of the Government causing injury, then the intentional tort exception does not bar such a claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1474.619" offset="6025054">State and federal courts across this land have entertained successful negligence actions under Section 448, notwithstanding the presence of gross, violent and often homicidal conduct on the part of intervening tort feasors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.413" offset="6092241">Indeed, Appellee's brief references such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.881" offset="6106034">Recovery against the Government has been had in such cases, and several of them, including Jablonski, Gibson, White, Underwood, Fair, Hicks and Rodgers have also been cited for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.606" offset="6157025">The Government, however, seeks to distinguish such cases on the bases that the intervening tort feasor in those cases was not a government employee... a distinction that the circuit court did not address in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.765" offset="6217629">The Government clearly advocates that the doctrine espoused in Panella v. United States by Judge, later Justice Harlan, and its progeny, including Naisbitt and Hughes, barring recovery under Section 2680(h) any time the intervening tort feasor is a government employee should be the interpretation adopted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.714" offset="6309371">In attempting to explain away cases in which the Government has been held liable involving intervening tort feasors who were government employees, the Government has attempted to distinguish those cases on the bases of a special duty undertaken in hospital, parole and prison situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.442" offset="6384290">Neither approach is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.794" offset="6393694">The proper object of a court attempting to construe one of the subsections of 2680 is to identify the circumstances which are within the words and reason of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.035" offset="6442700">Interpreting the intent of Congress in adopting the intentional tort exception, it seems more likely to believe that the policy underlying the exception was to insulate the Government from liability for acts it was powerless to prevent, or which would make defense of a lawsuit unusually difficult, rather than it was intended to defeat actions steeped in negligence merely because the intervening tort feasor was a government employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.638" offset="6557116">There is no sound basis for disallowing a Section 448 case merely because the intervening tort feasor is a government employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.660" offset="6597240">As was said by the circuit court, the intentional tort exception should bar a cause of action only if negligence is a remote cause of the injury, or plaintiff, through artful pleadings with conclusory allegations, attempts to create a negligence issue where none exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.057" offset="6670801">Where the Third Circuit decided the assault and battery of Private Heard upon Private Shearer was a natural result of the Government's failure to exercise due care, the assault and battery may be deemed to have its roots in negligence, and is therefore within the scope of the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.202" offset="6751363">This will require the Plaintiff in any case to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate that the Government knew or should have known that its employee was dangerous prior to the injurious act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.493" offset="6796502">Unlike cases such as Naisbitt, Collins and Wine cited by the Government for the proposition that a negligence analysis is not necessary where the intervening tort feasor is a government employee, the factual negligence predicate in Shearer is startling, shocking, and of such magnitude that the Government should not be heard to complain that liability for their blatant negligence should not attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.958" offset="6902350">A negligent omission arises where the act necessary to avoid negligence should have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.130" offset="6931085">The failure to eliminate Private Heard in this matter, convicted of homicide while serving at his last duty assignment, despite ringing recommendations from his superior officers that he be eliminated from the service, and exposing service members like Shearer to his violent propensities without warning amounts to negligence of a gross order.</text>

John L. Hayes, that the exemption of a sovereign from suit involves hardship enough where consent has been held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.355" offset="8328009">We are not to add to its rigor by refinement of construction where consent has been announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.723" offset="8345459">Panella, upon which the Government has placed so much reliance, of course did permit a Section 448 type recovery by holding that the intentional tort exception does not apply to a non-government employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.067" offset="8402824">To the extent that the circuit court decision in Panella affirmed the district court holding that a case founded in negligence will not lie where the intervening tort feasor is a government employee, Panella should not be followed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.992" offset="8462487">The FTCA is a negligence statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.742" offset="8473563">It permits recovery for the negligent acts of its employees committed in the course of their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.646" offset="8497178">But the case before the Court is not one founded on a battery negligently performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.300" offset="8519748">The negligence upon which suit is founded is related to the battery only to the extent that the battery is the proximate, predictable and foreseeable outgrowth of the Government's negligence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.623" offset="8565096">What was said by the Third Circuit in the Gibson case to the effect that the very risk which constituted the defendant's negligence was the probability of the action which occasioned the injury is applicable to the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.533" offset="8620685">The Government's efforts to distinguish cases like Underwood and Fair where the intervening tort feasor was a government employee on the bases that those cases involve extension of a special duty of protection to the intervening tort feasors, in those cases because they have been hospitalized, is not convincing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.495" offset="8696545">As the Jablonski Ninth Circuit court said, it is more significant in these cases that they are based on negligence, not assault and battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.165" offset="8731235">Indeed, although the Government says that Section 319 of the restatement involving a theory of negligence where the Government does assume a special duty, that that should be some sort of demarcation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.323" offset="8787869">But the fact is that Section 319 just gives a plaintiff an alternate theory of negligence in addition to 448, and there is nothing about Section 319 that involves indeed a waiver of the exception, in spite of which recovery has been permitted in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.886" offset="8866132">The better explanation for these cases is that the injuries were rooted in Government negligence to a depth that was not superseded by the intervening tort feasor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.492" offset="8904479">As occurred in the circuit court, employment of a government versus a non-government employee analysis should be rejected properly in favor of a proximate cause analysis.</text>
