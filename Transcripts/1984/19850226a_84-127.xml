            <label>Mr. Lawrence E. Walsh</label>
            <text syncTime="35.154" offset="272174">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.506" offset="277607">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="39.125" offset="288056">We are here on certiorari to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.029" offset="319717">It reversed an order disqualifying two Los Angeles lawyers for misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.449" offset="345421">The first lawyer, Mr. Butler, was disqualified on a finding that after a pre-trial... after a series of pre-trial orders holding certain material inadmissible because of its unfair, prejudicial nature, and after the venire for the jury with which this case was going to be tried had reported to the courthouse, he released this material, this very material and nothing else, to a single correspondent for publication in Washington's leading newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.093" offset="503932">The District Court found that he did this with an intent to circumvent its orders and to prejudice the Defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.048" offset="543743">Allis was disqualified on a finding that he procured a statement from a crucial witness into an investigation of fraud on the court with an intent to thwart that investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.791" offset="598704">These findings were coupled by a third principal finding of the District Court; that the removal of these two lawyers would not leave the Plaintiffs unrepresentative or ineffectively represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.551" offset="661816">Two of the remaining six lawyers are leaders in the Bendectin litigation and thy third is Mr. Jacob Stein, a former president of the Bar Association of this District and a bar leader by any definition who lead the Washington back-up team for these Plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.981" offset="747498">One further point before I come to the question of appealability and that is that the removal of these lawyers occurred not during the trial but at a pre-trial phase where there would have been any adjustment necessary to permit the remaining counsel to absorb the full load of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.080" offset="831926">We would like first to go to the question of appealability.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.782" offset="850734">At the time the appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals, Flanagan against the United States had not been decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.285" offset="876752">It was decided a year ago and it held that disqualification of counsel orders in criminal cases are not appealable prior to final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.160" offset="920219">There are two halves to the opinion as it was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.481" offset="937460">The first half sets out very strongly the urgency in criminal cases, but the second half measures disqualification orders against the standards of Cohen and Coopers and Lybrand and concludes that by their nature they cannot qualify with the second and third tests of the trilogy established by those two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.779" offset="1042682">Without going to the question of whether a disqualification order is conclusive assuming that it is for the purpose of this case as the Court did in Flanagan.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.337" offset="1088971">It leaves the question is the order entirely separate from the underlying case or not and this Court held that if a showing of prejudice in addition to error is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.199" offset="1152396">It is not entirely separate because the prejudice would require and examination of the trial record.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.936" offset="1175279">On the other hand, if an order is reversible without a showing of prejudice the third test is not met and it is effectively reviewable after judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.362" offset="1233062">So, it seemed as soon as this came down that the logic projected into civil cases as well as criminal and a special brief was filed to point that out to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.222" offset="1292517">It, however, disagreed with our position and attempted to distinguish this Court's holding in Flanagan and suggest a different rule for civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.263" offset="1340686">Its first point... Incidentally, its discussion of this begins on 20A of the Appendix to the Petition and the distinction begins on 29A.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.920" offset="1395230">Its first point was that if in a civil case as distinguished from a criminal case to reverse a judgment it would be necessary to show that the error was prejudicial and that to show prejudice after trial in a civil case would be extremely difficult and would, according to the Court, would resolve itself into competing speculations as to whether Lawyer No. 1 would have tried the case differently from Lawyer No. 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.407" offset="1533261">In doing this it went back to holdings of Courts of Appeals prior to Flanagan and it in attempting to show why it would be more difficult to reach a decision as to prejudice after final judgment in a civil case rather than a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.773" offset="1630646">It suggested that in criminal cases there is experience with minimum standards of effective representation and that that type of... that same question had not been coming up in civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.599" offset="1681950">It did not explain why that was so esoteric that the learning in the criminal side couldn't be adapted to the civil side.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.253" offset="1712566">And, we respectfully suggest that it exaggerates the difficulty of reviewing for prejudice after judgment, that it would not turn on a speculative, retrospective comparison, it would turn on whether the Plaintiffs were able to get lawyers of a comparable standing with those they lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.286" offset="1796680">The holdings of this Court prior to Flanagan have made clear that effectively unreviewable doesn't mean just reviewable with difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.109" offset="1852059">It means truly unreviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.977" offset="1867524">That was a holding in Firestone and in the Coopers and Lybrand where they contention was a denial of class action treatment will make it financially impossible to go ahead with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.737" offset="1930531">The Court said, notwithstanding that, it was effectively reviewable and that the problems of financing the case would not be accepted as a substitute for meeting the Cohen trilogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.663" offset="1986224">And, finally, it is very hard to show a difference between criminal and civil cases except for this one added experience that have been had in criminal cases reviewing minimum effective standards, minimum standards for effective representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1150.840" offset="4734933">It did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.909" offset="4739217">And, again, this goes, I think, to the transient relationship between the lawyer and the court and the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.146" offset="4764190">Coming to Butler, the Court below did not disturb the finding as to intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.685" offset="4806299">That stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.435" offset="4809330">Nor did it really reach the question of misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.739" offset="4826571">It held that even if all of these things were so, that there was not a sufficient effect upon the underlying case to justify disqualification and that that should be restricted to truly egregious conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.950" offset="4899400">Now, in holding that Mr. Butler's conduct was not truly egregious, the Court looked not to what he did but to the article as it was published and suggested that this was, indeed, a balanced article.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.679" offset="4966273">Well, balance depends upon a definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.447" offset="4977349">If you take a very strong case and a very weak case and make them look equal, I suppose you could say that is balanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.101" offset="5003994">But, all of the emotional, heart-tugging part of that story was pro-plaintiff and anti-defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.290" offset="5036699">And the worst part of the story the Court of Appeals didn't even recognize which was the attribution to the Defendant of responsibility for Thalidomide which crippled thousands of children in Europe where it was sold by German and English pharmaceutical companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.566" offset="5101797">Now, the Defendant is touched by Thalidomide because it had licensed it and was testing it for introduction into this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.756" offset="5134606">At the time its teratogenicity was discovered was testing immediately stopped and... but there were some cases that arose from the testing program which were settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.396" offset="5185179">There other cases where people with misfortunes of having children with birth defects claimed to have taken Thalidomide and those cases were tried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.906" offset="5243171">Now, Mr. Butler tried one of those cases and won it and in the middle of this story is this discussion of how he won a case for a legless child against the Defendant who had sold Thalidomide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.531" offset="5285699">Now, it is not only a devastating reminder of a 20-year old tragedy, but it is a... Thalidomide is going to be a source of daily discussion in the trial because Thalidomide is the classic teratogen against all other claims... of which all other claims of teratogenicity are measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.896" offset="5383188">So, it is not as though it is going to be a forgotten thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.681" offset="5394264">And a juror who has read the story, even though he has momentarily forgotten it, this is all going to come back as this horror of Thalidomide is reiterated on an almost daily basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.441" offset="5449330">For those reasons, Your Honor, we... It was really the Butler thing that impelled our petition for certiorari, that the message could go out to the profession that it is not sufficiently egrecious to do this sort of thing; that if you don't get your evidence in legitimately you can use a newspaper correspondent to do it with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.925" offset="5555282">I would like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal if I may.</text>

            <text syncTime="1368.149" offset="5604184">It may be helpful at the outside to define a little more clearly the posture in which this case is here and more precisely how it got through the two lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.874" offset="5655070">The District Court proceeded on a set of assumptions about how it could decide the disqualification issue which no one defends in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.813" offset="5694881">The District Court proceeded on the assumption that because these lawyers had been admitted pro hac vice they could be disqualified on grounds less substantial than those that would be applicable to regularly admitted counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.691" offset="5762381">The Court expressly said that in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.191" offset="5772308">And, the Court said further that precisely because of that reason she was not going to go on to determine whether these lawyers had engaged in any definable act of misconduct, any violation of disciplinary rules; that it was sufficient in her view if their conduct was</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.003" offset="5843570">"impermissible in the view of the Court. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.205" offset="5856422">So, that was the standard by which these lawyers were judged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.507" offset="5873663">Was it impermissible in the view of the Court?</text>

            <text syncTime="1438.042" offset="5883798">Do you suggest that that judge did not taken into account prevailing standards of the profession?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="1445.881" offset="5915145">Well, Your Honor, the Court expressly said that she was not making the assessment of whether these counsel had violated the prevailing standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.284" offset="5948686">At one point during the hearing, for example, she said to Mr. Allis while he was on the witness stand... this is page 166 of the Joint Appendix... I will not decide whether Mr. Allis violated any canon of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.961" offset="6007410">So, we had sort of a standard list determination that in the view of this judge this was impermissible and that that is all it took because these lawyers were from out of town.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.304" offset="6056833">Now, the Court of Appeals reviewed that and said that is wrong as a matter of the local rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.292" offset="6084732">The local rules are quite clear that once an out-of-town counsel is admitted for the purpose of a case, that counsel is to be judged by the identical standards that are applicable to regularly admitted counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.051" offset="6139798">The Court quoted from the rules and explained that that was the applicable situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.055" offset="6163831">The Court then went on to say what he understood to be required before lawyers could be disqualified in a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.459" offset="6197372">It said, look, the question here is, first of all, they said, there must be a definable act of misconduct, there must be a violation of the standard of conduct under the disciplinary rules or of some rule of court or, indeed, of some implicit powers that the court has to control its own courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.955" offset="6279397">It is understood that the courts have those and can exercise a contempt power over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.759" offset="6298623">But, there must be one of those things before a court can disqualify lawyers because, after all, what is disqualification?</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.400" offset="6341150">You have lawyers and clients who have entered into a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.202" offset="6356406">In a free society, they are entitled to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.554" offset="6365810">Disqualification is vitiation of that contract to the substantial injury of both parties to that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.058" offset="6395798">It was particularly aggravated in this case because these lawyers had invested literally 6,000 hours in the preparation of this case for trial and it was due to go to trial imminently and their disqualification meant that people were going to have to start over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.401" offset="6453163">But, the Court said at a minimum to justify--</text>

            <text syncTime="1606.702" offset="6558384">--Well, what the record clearly shows, and this is not contradicted, is that in terms of preparation of the case on the merits for trial Mr. Butler and Mr. Allis were regarded as the principal trial counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.942" offset="6607390">They had done the yeoman's work... They had done almost all the major preparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.663" offset="6626198">Two other lawyers had done some work in preparation for being back-ups, assistants to Mr. Butler and Mr. Allis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.550" offset="6657754">But, it is not disputable that they were the two lawyers who were gearing up to try this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.154" offset="6680219">The other lawyers, this number that accumulates to eight, are lawyers who were not participating actively in the present preparation of this case on the merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.927" offset="6715328">In any event, the Court of Appeals said we must have a definable act of misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.331" offset="6736957">Secondly, the Court of Appeals said not every definable act of misconduct should produce a disqualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.769" offset="6770708">There are ways to punish misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.371" offset="6781052">There are obviously sanctions that the Bar can impose and there are sanctions that the Court can impose through its contempt power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.709" offset="6810414">Disqualification, unlike those punitive sanctions, has the very unpleasant side effect that it deprives the client of the lawyer of his choice and can do so in a way that will be very injurious, which I want to get into at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.821" offset="6878855">So, said the Court, we agree with the Second Circuit rule in Nyquist which has now been rather generally embraced by the commentators and by several courts of appeals, that where disqualification is contemplated, its purpose is not punishment of the lawyers, punish the lawyers other ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.067" offset="6955864">The function of disqualification is to assure that lawyers will not, by remaining in the case, imperil the integrity of the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1959.064" offset="7967847">They say you decide whether Allis and Butler engaged in an act of misconduct and you decide whether the District Court's result could be justified by the application of the proper principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.990" offset="8019570">And, the Court of Appeals said, well, obviously we can't do that if it turns on disputed issues that the District Court didn't decide, but on this record there are no disputed issues that are necessary for us to recognize that, number one, Mr. Allis committed no act of misconduct, no conceivable act of misconduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2134.394" offset="8669183">But, the thing I want to emphasize is that Mr. Allis did absolutely nothing wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.446" offset="8689349">The assertion that the District Court found that he was desiring to thwart an investigation is not an accurate reflection of what the District Court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.821" offset="8734907">The District Court's sole finding as to Allis' intent is that he wanted to get a written, sworn statement from his secretary retracting what she had told the other side and that is correct, because, after all, she had told him what was told to the other side was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.401" offset="8809199">She also told him she was about to run off to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.269" offset="8820693">And, he asked, are you willing to put that... what you have just told me in a sworn statement and she said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.571" offset="8841904">So, the District Court found he had the intent to take a statement from his secretary retracting what she had told the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.177" offset="8872311">Then the District Court announced what were a series of legal propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.065" offset="8891851">He had a duty not to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.765" offset="8898642">Allis has the duty to investigate whether his client is committing a fraud upon the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.234" offset="8924556">He had no such duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.836" offset="8930930">The Court of Appeals convincingly demonstrates that he had no such duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.872" offset="8947021">This is not a case where he knew his client was engaged in a fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.257" offset="8960605">He had overwhelming evidence supporting the good faith of his client and his own secretary was telling him things that supported it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.596" offset="8985996">The Court then said in its conclusion on page 77A, because he had this duty and because he took a retraction from his secretary, that can be characterized as an attempt to thwart an investigation by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.392" offset="9061124">So, a notion that that was his state of mind and that is what the Court has found is not accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.961" offset="9083380">The Court found only that he took a statement from a witness believing it to be true which she was telling him was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.699" offset="9106368">That is not a violation of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.582" offset="9113891">It is a great injustice to both him and to the client that he was disqualified in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2617.588" offset="10601931">--It did not and I want to explain why that doesn't apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.438" offset="10613320">First, the coinfactors developed in civil cases and what the court said is there are always weights on the scale against an interlocutory appeal, heavy weights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.396" offset="10653131">But then over the years certain exceptions developed and the Court was able to identify that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.050" offset="10675805">When these three factors are present, they outweigh the interest against an interlocutory appeal in a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.969" offset="10707465">Then the criminal cases came and as Flanagan succinctly demonstrates the weights against an interlocutory appeal are much, much heavier in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.629" offset="10758143">So, the same factors that would tip the scale in a civil case aren't sufficient to tip it in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.533" offset="10785728">You need a lot, lot more and, indeed, there have been very few instances where this Court has been able to find that that was so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.139" offset="10816135">The second thing that is different... and this is key I think to this appealability case... and that is that there is no effective review of the disqualification of counsel after judgment is entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.998" offset="10875589">The most persuasive demonstration of that appears in the Ninth Circuit's decision in Gough versus Perkowski and since I won't have time to lay it all out I strongly urge the Court to read that before deciding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.456" offset="10921356">As they point out, what would the issue be on appeal?</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.841" offset="10938910">The issue would be whether the disqualified lawyer would have gotten a better result for the client than the lawyer who actually tried the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.180" offset="10972347">That is not like any other prejudice finding courts make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.066" offset="10987811">Ordinarily, if the issue is whether a piece of evidence was improperly admitted, the court can look at the record that was actually made, it can compare it to the record as it would have been, and it can... it is not easy, but it can determine what that difference is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.475" offset="11049460">But, in this area, it is comparing a record that was actually made to a total unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.479" offset="11073493">What would have happened if the other lawyer tried the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.081" offset="11083942">Lawyers aren't fungible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.866" offset="11091047">Some do much better jobs than others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.735" offset="11098571">How would that lawyer have tried the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.018" offset="11107661">What tactical differences would have been made?</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.937" offset="11115289">It is impossible to make that assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.055" offset="11127828">What the courts of appeals have uniformly said... not a one has ever deviated from this... we are not competent to measure prejudice after a judgment when a lawyer has been disqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.197" offset="11176415">We can't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.997" offset="11179550">The Ninth Circuit considered how could we go about doing it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.915" offset="11195224">How could we get the other record to compare what actually happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.802" offset="11210793">Well, they said we could have a post-judgment motion in the District Court in which the disqualified lawyers come forward and show how they would have tried the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.091" offset="11255932">Now, proposition one, who is going to make this post-judgment motion?</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.793" offset="11270770">Not the disqualified lawyers, they can't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.293" offset="11280801">Not the lawyer who tried the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.328" offset="11288846">The purpose of this is to show that it should have been done better, that it could have been done better.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.297" offset="11304729">So now the client is off to hire a third lawyer to make this post-judgment thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.034" offset="11319671">Now the lawyers come in and they say with the benefit of hindsight, to be sure, we would have tried this case in an entirely different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.755" offset="11346629">We have much more effective jury arguers, we are much more articulate in the way we present it, we would have called three experts, they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.610" offset="11377976">We would have done, this, that, and the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.026" offset="11383723">The Defendant is going to come running in saying, oh, no, no, if they had done that that wouldn't have affected the outcome of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.114" offset="11408069">We are going to generate a whole second trial at an enormous cost in judicial resources just to create the record so that you have something to compare.</text>

            <text syncTime="3056.398" offset="12357150">Now, the other part of Flanagan that distinguishes it is that the nature of the claim made in Flanagan was different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.420" offset="12389228">Here the claim is the District Court has taken away our contract without justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.907" offset="12411171">Sure, it is subject to being taken away if disqualification is proper, but it is not subject to be taken away otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.180" offset="12444295">In Flanagan the claim was that the Defendant's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.417" offset="12469268">And, as this Court explained very succinctly and clearly, it was an element of that claim that there be a conviction under improper circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.892" offset="12519109">The claim, in other words, was not that the disqualification itself was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.610" offset="12538022">By invoking the Fifth and Sixth Amendments the claim was I am not going to get a trial that is a proper trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.115" offset="12568011">Because that was so, the Court was able to say in Flanagan the second criteria, that the issue decided be completely separate from the merits, is not present here since it is an element of the claim you are advancing that you ultimately be convicted in a way prejudiced you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.529" offset="12645751">In our case, the claim being made is different.</text>

            <text syncTime="3137.017" offset="12679606">I, the client, was entitled to have this lawyer represent me and there was a consummated wrong when the District Court vitiated that contract without cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="3169.988" offset="12811576">Based on something you said in your opening argument, would you think that there would be an absence of prejudice regardless of who has the burden if your client could show in the subsequent proceedings here that there were other counsel equally well recognized in the profession as those who were disqualified who would take the work... substitute their same rate of pay and all the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.286" offset="12904677">Would that disprove prejudice?</text>

            <text syncTime="3197.404" offset="12921186">I think prejudice can't be measured over whether one question more was asked in cross examination or not, but with Mr. Stein, who incidentally is committed for the full commitment to these Plaintiffs--</text>

            <text syncTime="3209.898" offset="12971132">But then does it not follow... If that is an adequate disproof of prejudice, you will never have prejudice in any of these cases because the Bar is big enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="3219.853" offset="13011047">--Let me give an example that occurred to me, Mr. Justice, where I think there could be a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.288" offset="13028706">If a person from New York with not such a good case... where we have a strong, emotionally charged case like this, there would be no trouble getting the best lawyers in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.631" offset="13078130">But, supposing it was a weak case and a person came to the District from New York and didn't know the Bar and one thing or another and if the lawyer who came down is a friend to handle the case was disqualified, then I could see a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.427" offset="13149287">In that kind of a case I would think... It goes to a question raised in Mr. Justice Rehnquist's concurrence in Firestone, that a court would reconsider.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.782" offset="13190665">There is nothing that forecloses further reconsideration here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.834" offset="13206966">If Mr. Stein went to the court and became a judge and others went to the Department of Justice and were not available, even though the district judge might have strong reluctance to police Mr. Butler for a 12-week trial, I think there would be a basis for reconsideration on new evidence, but that is the example I--</text>
