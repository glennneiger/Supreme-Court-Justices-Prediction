            <text syncTime="86.106" offset="473343">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, at issue in this case is the constitutionality of a key feature of Title 1 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.014" offset="528932">Over the 19 years of its existence, Title 1 has been universally recognized and hailed as the largest and most successful federal educational effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.971" offset="576788">The Congressional objective was to break the poverty cycle at its most vulnerable point by providing supplemental remedial educational services, such as remedial reading and remedial math, to children who meet two qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.449" offset="642721">The first is educational deprivation, which means performance at a level below normal for their age, and the second is residence in an area that has a high concentration of families with incomes below the poverty level.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.542" offset="699041">Pursuant to Department of Education regulations, Title 1 programs are administered by local public school boards denominated by the regulations as local education agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.868" offset="756406">One thing that is not at issue in this case is that Title 1 is a program that works.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.355" offset="790365">Everyone agrees that children at all levels have experienced significant measurable advances thanks to the benefits of this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.330" offset="830176">The Court of Appeals which held it unconstitutional described it as a program that apparently has done so much good and little, if any, detectable harm, and the appellees agree, having acknowledged it as a good and successful program that has contributed substantially to the educational needs of educationally deprived children.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.361" offset="926307">Are there some around the country that are not offered on the premises of the private schools?</text>
            <text syncTime="207.634" offset="959430">And would you be able to characterize the extent to which other programs under Title 1 are offered within public schools?</text>

            <text syncTime="220.441" offset="1010630">Those that have had experience with Title 1, Justice O'Connor, have almost universally come to the conclusion that off premises just doesn't work, that it is educationally unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.201" offset="1065696">I am informed by my colleagues at the Department of Education that there is one special circumstance in one school district that has been able to make it work because of special circumstances.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="248.628" offset="1123374">--I am not certain that that is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.746" offset="1139884">I am only aware of one where it in fact has been able to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.215" offset="1153781">Now, I should add this, that in a study done by the Department of Education in the State of Missouri, and this quote is in the brief, and of course the study itself is in the record, the Department of Education based on that study raised the question whether off premises Title 1 services could ever really be comparable as Congress declared that it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.217" offset="1265794">And the facts of this case demonstrate why that is a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.288" offset="1290036">There are theoretically four possible time and place combinations available to any local education agency that is charged with the responsibility of seeing to it that Title 1 programs offered to nonpublic schools are comparable to the programs that are available to public school children.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.486" offset="1386793">Those four combinations are off premises during the regular school hours, off premises after hours or before hours, on premises during the regular school hours, and on premises after hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.144" offset="1441441">During the 1965-66 school year, the New York City Board of Education explored all three of the other alternatives before settling on the one at issue in this case as the only one that was educationally sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.273" offset="1509987">Its experience with the two after hours options demonstrated them both to be what the board described as a total failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.063" offset="1549170">The students were tired.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.813" offset="1556171">The parents were concerned about safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.599" offset="1567247">There was something of a stigma effect because the students, many of them concluded that they were being punished because they were required to stay after school, and communication between Title 1 teachers and the regular classroom teachers was virtually impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.042" offset="1629105">We turn now to the off premises options, which is more directly responsive to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.548" offset="1659094">What New York found was that in addition to those problems that characterized the after hours problems, and there are some of those, because any time you go off premises you consume prime time that ought to be used for study, and prime time is particularly important when you have students whose motivation is in any event below average.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.513" offset="1750940">It is particularly important that it be used for study purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.132" offset="1765464">But the other problem with off premises, unless it is just very, very close, is the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.769" offset="1787929">In order to pay the transportation and other noninstructional costs in the case of this particular program would have consumed about 42 percent of the total nonpublic Title 1 budget for the City of New York, and that would have meant that about 5,000 children in New York City would have been deprived of Title 1 services.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.551" offset="1887090">It literally would have been a trade of bus services for Title 1 services.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.121" offset="1905376">And since the Department of Education has consistently interpreted the equal expenditure provision as requiring that instructional services be equal, most of the children eliminated from the program in order to pay these noninstructional costs would have been public school students.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.167" offset="1973608">In short, the New York City Board of Education was bound by the Congressional mandate to provide comparable services to children attending public and nonpublic schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.689" offset="2019688">This Court in Wheeler versus Parrera held that the plenary responsibility for determining whether the nonpublic program did or did not comply with the comparability requirement set by Congress was to be vested in the local education agency, and that is exactly what the New York Board of Education did, and its selection of the option which would fulfill that obligation was based purely on educational considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.494" offset="2142881">The board's actual experience showed what common sense would in any event have confirmed, that children learn better when they are not tired, that they can learn better in a classroom than they can on a school bus, and that money and time spent for transportation doesn't do much to remedy reading or math deficiencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.121" offset="2217383">This case is different from others that have previously come before this Court in that we are not left to speculate about how the program might work.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.263" offset="2261895">This one has been in existence for over 18 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.065" offset="2277151">The case was tried based on an extensive record developed before an earlier three-judge District Court in a case called the Pearl case, and on selected additional affidavits and documents.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.140" offset="2537435">The Pearl court, for example, found that in compliance with the extensive Title 1 regulations, New York had established what it called a well defined dichotomy between purely secular instruction and activity subject to religious influences, and those findings were confirmed by the findings of the District Court in this case, and I quote,</text>

            <text syncTime="712.361" offset="2978382">Just how is it even if the record didn't show otherwise that religious indoctrination is somehow supposed to infiltrate this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.817" offset="3016207">Is the danger that public school teachers might teach religion?</text>
            <text syncTime="725.169" offset="3029582">If that is the supposed risk, why have the appellees failed to uncover even one single instance in which that actually in fact occurred over the almost two decades the program has been in existence?</text>
            <text syncTime="738.678" offset="3083603">And in any event, the argument proves too much, because the risk is just as great when public employees teach in public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.701" offset="3115681">Well, if that is not the risk, is it the danger that the nonpublic teachers will, once these public professionals come on with their... somehow block these public teachers and indoctrine them?</text>
            <text syncTime="761.109" offset="3173360">Surely the courts' decisions suggesting a distinction between aid to elementary schools and aid to colleges would teach that indoctrination of other adults is not the risk with which this Court's establishment clause jurisprudence is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.887" offset="3240442">Those distinctions apply a fortiori when it is not college students but college graduates, professional teachers.</text>

            <text syncTime="850.185" offset="3529670">There are a couple of distinctions, and I think they were adequately brought out in the previous argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.755" offset="3555897">It may be a little easier to identify these as supplemental and as non-core, but that is only because of this happenstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.980" offset="3604798">There is a statute, and it is cited at... a section of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.919" offset="3636563">It is Section 3807(b) of the statute, which specifically requires, which specifically prohibits any of the Title 1 funds being used for regular curriculum purposes, and it cannot be used to provide services that are not otherwise available, and if they are used for those purposes, then we sue to get the money back.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.849" offset="3728305">We have done it before, and we have another case that will be here later this year involving, in this instance, services that are used for... that were otherwise available, but the lesson that comes from that is not that the Grand Rapids program is bad and ours is good.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.580" offset="3803224">It is rather that the... that this rather clean analytical framework has been provided where you have a federal government that is not in the education business and therefore must necessarily superimpose its remedial program on an existing program as demonstrating the clean distinction between remedial programs on the one hand and core curriculum programs on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.128" offset="3905415">But that distinction should be no less available to a state that does not have a similarly clean analytical framework because there is just as much of a distinction between remedial programs and non-remedial programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.205" offset="3957765">Now, there is one other distinction, and it is not one that is dispositive, but it is certainly one that... well, I think it is persuasive, and that is that these... that this is, after all, a Congressional determination that we are dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.416" offset="4030594">Surely a Congress... well, in the final analysis the issue here is whether Congress can require that its benefits be spread equally.</text>

            <text syncTime="1033.955" offset="4264756">We have here a problem that has been faced by three separate branches of government at two different levels of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.965" offset="4320762">On the one, from the legislative branch, Congress has made its basic policy decision to spread the benefits of this program equally between public and nonpublic students.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.605" offset="4371335">A local executive agency has done a commendably conscientious and thorough job of administering that decision, of implementing that decision consistent with sound educational practices and two separate trial courts have found that the concerns hypothesized in other cases have not materialized in this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.102" offset="4453255">If the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, the comparability requirement acknowledged by this Court in Wheeler will still be in place, as will most aspects of Title 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.878" offset="4516367">The consequence will not be, as Mr. Geller argues in his brief, that all those Title 1 funds will then simply be transferred over to the public sphere, because if the Court of Appeals is correct that it is the on premises function that renders it unconstitutional, you still have in place the Congressional determination that these programs must be equal, but with the one option that has been demonstrated to be educationally sound, the most educationally sound and available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.952" offset="4656697">So that the result will be a program which still serves both public and nonpublic children but serves fewer of them, some of them not as well, a program which will expend scarce dollars and student time on bus rides instead of remedial instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.830" offset="4724197">Now, all of that, we are told, is required not because of anything in this record, but because this Court held, laid down in Meek versus Pittenger a per se rule that requires us to ignore the actual facts of the particular case, and instead erects a per se rule that any on premises instruction constitutes an establishment of religion, and the Court of Appeals simply misread Meek versus Pittenger.</text>

            <text syncTime="1257.199" offset="5157725">Rather than deciding for all time and all purposes that on premises instruction was mandated by the First Amendment, this Court rather carefully outlined... declined to reach that issue on that case specifically for this reason, that it would be wholly inappropriate for us to attempt to render an opinion on the First Amendment when no specific plan is before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.516" offset="5274963">A federal court does not sit to render a decision on hypothetical facts, and the Court of Appeals was correct in so concluding, and I believe that that is also a rejection of a per se approach in these establishment areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.209" offset="5329716">Moreover, perhaps even more helpful is an example that the Court used in Wheeler versus Parrera in which it gave some of the types of problems, some of the types of possibilities that might be considered by a local education agency in performing its responsibility to assure that these programs were comparable, and I am quoting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.176" offset="5429608">"For example, a program whereby a former parochial school teacher is paid with Title 1 funds to teach full time in a parochial school undoubtedly would present quite different problems than if a public school teacher solely under public control is sent into a parochial school to teach special remedial courses a few hours a week. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.440" offset="5518633">Now, that was not a ruling on the constitutional issue, but it does identify a range of possibilities that might be considered, and it precisely describes the Title 1 experience, which is presumably at the permissible end of that range.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.503" offset="5594911">It is difficult, I submit, to see how in this case, on this record, there has been any establishment of religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1666.378" offset="6794454">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I am glad that after about one hour and perhaps 15 minutes somebody who stood up to argue before you mentioned Meek against Pittenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.255" offset="6861954">I thought that was never going to be mentioned, because the appellees do not come before this Court in a void.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.861" offset="6900302">There have been decisions by the Court not only in Meek but in Marburger and there is the rationale of the decision in Lemon against Kurtzman and the rationale of the decision in Wolman against Walter that firmly support the position that the appellees took in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.195" offset="7009703">And while we are mentioning that there were two lower courts that decided on the New York City Title 1 program before the Court of Appeals did so after an alleged trial record, keep in mind that the trial, the so-called trial in this case consisted merely of the submission of written affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.913" offset="7116596">There were no witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.282" offset="7122029">There was no credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.915" offset="7128507">The same affidavits were before the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals unanimously decided otherwise than the District Courts on the same record, and with the same ability to do so.</text>

          <turn speaker="stanley_geller" startTime="1771.545" stopTime="1953.315">
            <label>Mr. Stanley Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="1771.545" offset="7215025">The Court of Appeals did not reject the findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.099" offset="7237281">It rejected the conclusions that were drawn from those findings, and I will go into the findings of fact because I don't believe that this so-called record supports the position that the government and the board of education and the intervenors take in this appeal, and I will tell you why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.679" offset="7315649">But first, let me say this about the benefits of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.218" offset="7349817">We agree with the appellants that this is a good statute and a good program, and it benefits needy children, and there need be no change in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.044" offset="7405092">I am amazed that the Solicitor General gets up and says that if you should strike down this program, that it will affect thousands of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.786" offset="7460054">It need not affect one, and I pointed that out in my memorandum, and it was not countered by the appellants in their memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.878" offset="7512403">There have never been enough funds in the Title 1 program to provide for all of the eligible children in the program, so that if the... and just confining ourselves to the New York City program, if you took the 20,000 children, and that is the total of it, who are now in that program, in the parochial schools mainly of New York, if you took them out of the program, you would be able to use those funds to provide the benefits to 20,000 eligible children in the public schools of New York who now do not receive the benefits of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.474" offset="7694738">In other words, the only thing that stops this, of course, is that the statute says that the aid must be provided equally, but I cannot believe that the Administration and the Congress, faced with a purpose, which I understand to be their purpose, to provide aid to needy children, would then waste money trying to get, if this Court struck down the program, waste money trying to get services to needy children in parochial schools when they could take the same money and provide the same needy children in the same school district with the full benefits of the Title 1 program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.955" offset="7876759">If this Court struck down this program as it is now applied, it need not, if Congress acts rationally, which I would assume it would do, affect the purpose of Congress, which is to provide aid to needy children.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1953.315" offset="7942169">Do you mean that if Congress takes some additional action, this result which you describe will prevail?</text>

          <turn speaker="stanley_geller" startTime="1963.420" stopTime="2481.224">
            <label>Mr. Stanley Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="1963.420" offset="7982607">Yes, I do, Your Honor, and what I cannot believe is that faced with a report from the Administration and from the Solicitor General that the program just doesn't work off premises, that Congress would insist on wasting money trying to deliver aid to the needy children in parochial schools when they could supply the same aid to needy children from the same background who happen to be attending public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.861" offset="8128370">And, Your Honor, I really do not accept the presumption which is made in this case that the parochial school students in New York City go to their schools primarily even because of their religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.888" offset="8188452">They are going to private schools because their parents perhaps don't want them to go to public schools, and if the aid were changed in this case, Congress would achieve its educational purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.763" offset="8235995">It might not achieve a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.196" offset="8245712">It might not achieve a purpose that runs afoul of the establishment clause, but it could surely achieve its educational purpose 100 percent in the way in which it is achieving now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.904" offset="8288553">The only question... the question... I won't say the only question, but the question that then arises may arise under the equal protection clause or the preexercise clause, but I understand that this Court has decided that when it decided that no state need supply every service to parochial schools that it supplies to private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.036" offset="8384997">Let me go to the question of the record in this case and what it professes to show, however, but let me start by saying what I understand and I think is conceded about what this Court determined in Meek and Marburger, and again in... really in Lemon and Kurzman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.635" offset="8479456">This Court decided all of those cases and the statutes and the programs in those cases on the face of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.542" offset="8527103">It held that it had sufficient common sense, as the Solicitor General argues, and the experience to know that when you place teachers and counselors on the premises of public schools, you have created a grave potential that they would in some manner foster religion, and the manner in which they do that I will come to in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.879" offset="8644445">It is not in the way that the Solicitor General mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.632" offset="8663463">And the Court said further, the only way you can avoid that potential danger is to have an almost inquisitorial surveillance, one which is so comprehensive and discriminating and continuing that the surveillance in itself would bring about an excessive entanglement that was an evil as great as the evil it sought to guard against, that of government fostering of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.635" offset="8787387">I don't... let me add just one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.087" offset="8797209">The Court said, and this was a corollary, that surveillance was, as far as it could see, the only way in which you could avoid this government fostering of religion because you could not rely on the good faith and the professionalism of the teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.952" offset="8896684">On that score, I would like to make one further point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.606" offset="8915283">Some distinction appears to be attempted to be made between Lemon and Kurtzman and Meek, because in Lemon and Kurtman the teachers were religious school teachers, and somehow the idea is that you could not accept the word of a religious school teacher that he would not engage in some act that would foster religion, but you can accept the word of a public school teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.279" offset="9058016">I don't think that makes any sense at all, and that in fact when it comes to award, you might well be more willing, if anything, to accept the word of a devoted nun, brother, priest, that he would not violate the establishment clause than that of any public school teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.359" offset="9138369">In this case, the present case, the appellants come before you and they say you were wrong deciding Meek and Marburger and Lemon facially because now you have before you 18 years of actual experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.189" offset="9217676">They say that the record shows that there is no evidence of an actual fostering of religion primarily, primarily by specific overt acts of teachers or guidance counselors actually inserting religious matter into their teaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.308" offset="9338153">The same record, however, shows you that you don't have any evidence of a real system of surveillance that the Court said in Meek and Marburger and Lemon would be required to detect that evidence of government fostering of religion and to guard against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.943" offset="9440658">So, in the record that you have now before you, you are still being asked to rely on the good faith and professionalism of the teachers, because the only way, the only way you would have got the evidence of impermissible conduct on the part of the teachers and counselors was that if they committed these detectable acts of impermissible conduct, they would have turned themselves in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.597" offset="9575241">There is no other way short of surveillance, of getting any such evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.901" offset="9600527">You either have to get it from the teachers and the guidance counselors themselves, or you don't get it, and that is why in this record... that is why this record is no proof that the Court or the majority of the Court were incorrect in deciding Meek and Marburger and Lemon facially.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.831" offset="9680253">On the record also, and the appellees argue, point out to you that the Court of Appeals held that this statute has done much good and little detectable, little detectable harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.465" offset="9790803">Now, I put it to you that the kind of fostering of religion that this record would show is not the kind in which you would actually find overt specific acts injecting religious matter into teaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.545" offset="9875022">The kind of harm actually lies elsewhere, and that is why in our papers we argue the fact that actually the main test to be applied here or a main test is the primary effect test, because what you have here is a kind of aid to religion which does not lie in the specific or overt act, but lies in the simple fact that you place public school teachers and guidance counselors on the premises of public schools and allow them to teach there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2581.623" offset="10455358">It would be very difficult, and that is what the Court of Appeals has stated quite wisely, to detect these specific overt acts of injecting religious material into this remedial instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.568" offset="10519201">The aid and support that this program, any program of supplying teachers and counselors onto the premises of private schools... parochial schools or religious schools gives to those schools does not lie in the injection of religious matter into the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.100" offset="10609272">It lies in the fact that you are providing someone, a teacher who is... actually can become the school personified.</text>

            <text syncTime="2678.287" offset="10842075">There are concrete ways, however, that are never discussed and can never be detected because you would never find the specific evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.875" offset="10880423">In this case you have a remedial teacher teaching remedial students who are the poorest students in the school educationally.</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.146" offset="13529448">If this case is reversed and the ruling is against you, can the Court make that reversal without overruling Meek against Pittenger in your estimation?</text>

            <text syncTime="3362.990" offset="13580857">I don't think so, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.423" offset="13590574">I really don't think so, because I don't think that you have... and that was my main point when I began.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.595" offset="13615234">I don't think that you have any facts in this record that can prove to you that the majority was wrong in Meek against Pittenger when it worried about the potential, because there has been no real surveillance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3387.188" offset="13677614">So that's for the Court to be candid in reversing, it must overrule Meek against Pittenger.</text>

            <text syncTime="3393.175" offset="13701543">I would say, Your Honor, that it would in effect be overruling Meek against Pittenger or, if I may, I think it would be... it would err respectfully in this sense, if it took this record and said that this record was proof that the Court had been wrong in Meek against Pittenger in deciding the statute in that case and in numerous other cases facially, because you have no experience, you have no experience in this case other than an experience which is necessarily based on reliance on the good faith and professionalism of the teachers, which was rejected in Meek, and there is nothing in this record that shows you that you have any more reason to rely on the good faith and professionalism of the teachers and guidance counselors in this case than in Meek.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="3455.265" offset="13949915">Just two brief points, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.634" offset="13967469">The first is that we have been exposed to a proposed First Amendment jurisprudence that is nothing less than astounding and that would completely turn on their heads these propositions that I had always assumed to be fundamental, that Constitution are presumed to be constitutional, that plaintiffs have the burden of proof, that findings are controlling unless clearly erroneous and cannot be overcome by speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.855" offset="14092334">My second point responds to Mr. Geller's suggestion that Congress may change its mind if this Court were to affirm, and to revoke the determination that it has now made or three occasions that these funds should be equal, equally available, those who do and those who do not exercise their constitutional right to send their children to private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.589" offset="14203198">And I submit that if that were to be the case, and Congress were to be told that it has no option other than to do that, that that result would be even less consonant with the religion clauses, less consonant with basic separation of powers principles, and the kinds of judgments that ought to be left to Congress, and would be an outrage to principles of basic fairness, particularly given the fact that we are dealing here with a Congressional determination that has been made by a legislative body that has been held to have a wide discretion with respect to its spending power, and that the choice to attend a religious school is itself constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.188" offset="14405595">So that the parents in poverty areas are put really to this option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.628" offset="14435374">They must either give up their right to a religious education or forfeit an equitable and equal share in this program that is purely secular and is purely directed at creating educational equality and has proven to be so successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.138" offset="14497441">It would be the ultimate constitutional irony if the religion clauses were the source of a rule which put the parents of private school children to that option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.080" offset="14553239">Thank you.</text>
