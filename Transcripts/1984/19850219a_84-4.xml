            <text syncTime="63.073" offset="397396">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="66.108" offset="409517">This case comes to you after the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the trial court judge's granting of a motion JNOV.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.350" offset="458523">Our position is that there is no evidence in this case upon which a reasonable juror could have concluded that the Planning Commission in this case denied the Respondent bank with all economical viable use of its property or any economically viable use that would constitute a taking requiring compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.097" offset="537517">To whatever extent the property lacked economic use we say was a function of the property itself, its configuration, and the prior development of that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.137" offset="585687">Now, to give you a brief history of this, this entire property consists of 676 acres that was purchased by a prior developer to the Respondent herein to develop into a cluster housing development around a golf course.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.349" offset="658516">That was begun in 1973, at which time the developers convinced the Planning Commission to... or actually, the county commission, to pass a cluster zoning ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.824" offset="708358">This ordinance did now allow greater density than one dwelling unit per acre, but it did allow you to cluster dwelling units closer together provided you preserved enough additional open space area within the same development so that you still ended up with one dwelling unit per acre.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.622" offset="799578">Now, this prior developer submitted a plat, a preliminary sketch plat to the Williamson County Planning Commission in 1973 and had it approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.997" offset="853076">That would be one of the two exhibits that have been passed out to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.702" offset="879930">It's contained in the Joint Appendix at 90... at page 422, Exhibit No. 9700.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.225" offset="913994">Now, at that time there was a two-step procedure by which a developer could have plats submitted and approved by the Planning Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.897" offset="956730">First, an initial or preliminary sketch plat would be presented which contained just generally the outline of the development, did not contain extensive engineering data.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.205" offset="997899">That would be looked at and determined whether or not it generally complied with the ordinances and the regulations, and then later, before a building permit was to be issued or the developer start developing, he would have to submit a so-called final plat either of the whole development, if he desired, or a section of it if he desired to develop only a section of the development at a time.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.237" offset="1094030">In this case, the developer, the prior developer, submitted only sectional final plats for approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.093" offset="1129452">He got about three or four of those, or three or four sections approved through the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.645" offset="1147738">The subdivision regulations in effect in 1973 provided that though this preliminary plat was approved in '73, it only lasted one year, that approval did.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.351" offset="1190474">It had to be renewed yearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.303" offset="1198311">It was not renewed yearly; it was renewed several times.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.238" offset="1214089">There was a gap from around 1976 through 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.872" offset="1228613">Then there was a gap again in August 1980 to November 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.824" offset="1248361">Nevertheless, the Respondent bank herein had originally loaned approximately $900,000 to the original developers.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.465" offset="1294964">Through a rather complicated series of events, this Respondent bank's subsidiaries or some of the banks it was associated with, went into bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.106" offset="1341566">This bank then bought out a greater interest through a swapping deal in this subdivision turned around... well, it got title to the property, the development at that time, but turned around and sold it back to the original developer.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.299" offset="1398304">He kept it another three or four years until Noember 1980, at which time he still wasn't able to develop the property out, he went under, and this Respondent bank then bought the remaining interest in this entire development that had not been fully developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.975" offset="1464969">It did not buy the original part of the development.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.277" offset="1474164">Now, several things occurred over the years that changed the entire situation with respect to this development that the Planning Commission had nothing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.771" offset="1528185">We say here that the plat that the Respondent bank is relying on in this lawsuit that it filed suit on, that plat it says it's relying on complies with the 1973 regulations, and it should be allowed to continue to develop the rest of the property with the '73 regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.100" offset="1617524">Actually, the Planning Commission had amended those regulations from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.986" offset="1633093">However, that plat on its face does not even comply with the original '73 regulations that the Respondent bank is claiming it's depending upon.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="1199.159" offset="4941762">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.527" offset="4959212">In a number of respects, affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case would represent a substantial departure from established principles under this Court's Fifth Amendment decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.419" offset="5002784">As an initial matter, as we point out in our brief, it doesn't appear that Respondents have ever alleged or proven that any taking that occurred in this case was without just compensation, because they haven't shown that a compensation remedy would be unavailable under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.028" offset="5061194">To ignore this essential element of a Fifth Amendment claim would be in effect to convert the Federal District Courts into claims courts for the states by permitting them to entertain inverse condemnations in any case, even though the state might also provide an inverse condemnation remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.204" offset="5125873">However, the submission of the United States in this case does not relate to the without just compensation aspect of the cause of action but rather to the question of whether there was a taking at all that required the payment of just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.846" offset="5172476">There are four points that are important to us, and I will identify them at the outset: first, that there was no taking in this case because the bank did not pursue procedures before the Petitioner to either obtain a variance or to seek to comply with the applicable regulations; secondly, that the Court of Appeals applied flawed analysis in determining what would be a taking in the zoning context; third, the Court of Appeals ignored the principle that unauthorized conduct by agents of the government such as the application of the wrong regulation here gives rise to a claim for just compensation rather than being in the nature of a tort for wrongful regulation that does not give rise to a claim for just compensation; and fourth, that no compensation was owed for a so-called temporary taking in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.964" offset="5385008">Now, in answer to several of the questions that have arisen before, looking at the first point, it does seem to us that the failure of the bank to seek to pursue procedures before the Planning Commission does end this case, and I think that the fact that neither the Court of Appeals nor the District Court passed on the question of whether the plat complied with the 1973 regulations only reinforces the conclusion that that's a matter for the Planning Commission to decide in the first instance, and in fact, the Planning Commission did decide that the submission did not comply with provisions that were present in both sets of regulations, the steep slope requirements, the length of the cul-de-sacs, the road grades, all matters pertaining to public safety that are quite aside from the density of the residential units on this piece of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.419" offset="5610810">And so the point is that the developer should submit his case to the Planning Commission, and as Mr. Estes pointed out, counsel for the bank conceded that variances would be required in this case to overcome the difficulties with the road grades and with the length of the cul-de-sacs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.131" offset="5681654">He simply wanted the Planning Commission to grant approval to the preliminary plat and then he would apply for variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.535" offset="5707254">But in fact, the subdivision regulations applied by the Commission say that the variance has to be applied for before the preliminary plat is approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.890" offset="5744662">And that alone, the absence of a variance request is alone sufficient basis for rejecting the plat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.727" offset="5772038">And the idea that the--</text>

            <text syncTime="1686.755" offset="6892169">We point out that there is a provision of the Strip Mining Act which is construed not to permit a denial of a permit to mine where it would result in a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.944" offset="6924874">In that instance you couldn't have a taking claim because the agency isn't authorized to apply it, so the appropriate thing to do would be to bring an injunctive action or to seek APA review of the denial of the permit in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.918" offset="6972730">I also wanted to briefly address what we see as two flaws in the takings analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.839" offset="6996449">The first is the notion of vested rights that the bank addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.557" offset="7015362">Vested rights does not mean property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.259" offset="7026125">It is a term of art in the zoning area which means as a matter of... when as a matter of state law a development has proceeded to a certain extent, state law permits them to complete the development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.067" offset="7069383">That is not the same thing as a property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.934" offset="7076802">When the government grants a license or a permit, it is not purporting to confer a property right on someone, and ordinarily the permit could be revoked, and in fact, in the very case that the bank relies on in this case, Schneider v. Lazarov, from the Tennessee Supreme Court, the Tennessee Supreme Court said that very thing with respect to building permits in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.130" offset="7157677">If a building permit is granted, it can be revoked without automatically giving rise to the claim for just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.118" offset="7181605">So the mere fact that the bank once had approval, even if it were so, for 736 units, does not forever give it a permanent exemption from the application of changes in the zoning ordinance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1836.318" offset="7490373">The issue before this Court is whether the state will be required to pay just compensation when its regulations destroy all practical economic value of private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.842" offset="7536453">To resolve that issue, Hamilton proposes the following two propositions of law:</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.746" offset="7556097">First, zoning regulations can effect a Fifth Amendment taking, at least in those rare cases in which the regulations go too far and destroy all practical economic value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.053" offset="7605311">Secondly, when a Fifth Amendment regulatory taking has occurred, the appropriate remedy is compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.391" offset="7630702">Now, returning to my first proposition which really leads me to respond to several of the questions raised by the Court, after 15 days of trial, 27 witnesses, and hundreds of documents, the jury was submitted the following special interrogatory: has Plaintiff been denied economically viable use of its property in violation of the just compensation clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
