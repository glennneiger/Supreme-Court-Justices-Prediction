            <text syncTime="30.352" offset="264319">The people of Ohio seek reversal of the determination that a bankruptcy court may discharge the duty of a debtor to comply with the state court injunction to abate a public health hazard by cleaning up a hazardous waste... a toxic waste facility.</text>

            <text syncTime="51.116" offset="347388">First, as a matter of public policy, the decision below treats the goals of the bankruptcy system as absolute values which transcend virtually every other matter of public policy, including the protection of public health and safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.525" offset="409037">Secondly, as to the factual context of this case, Ohio is not before this Court seeking compensation for past harm or expenses, but rather we are attempting to prevent future harm by obtaining compliance with an injunction to abate an ongoing nuisance and health hazard.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.360" offset="2612413">In the automatic statutory stay provisions, Congress said we did not want to interfere with the states and their police power enforcement activities; in the removal provisions, so that you cannot remove an enforcement action to the bankruptcy court; in 28 USC 959B, there is a specific provision requiring trustees to operate in compliance with state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2094.279" offset="8520057">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I think in analyzing this obligation, there is really only one point in time which is relevant, and that is on the date of bankruptcy, September 2, 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.341" offset="8592364">It matters little what the nature of the obligation was a year before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.578" offset="8621308">The only critical thing is what obligation did the bankrupt owe on the date of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.434" offset="8652655">You recall by that time, the Chem-Dyne site had been in the possession of a receiver for nearly eight months, and also in possession of all of Mr. Kovacs's then existing assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.293" offset="8720155">Now, this receivership was imposed in order to enforce the agreed judgment entry of July 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.168" offset="8763623">Whether we call that judgment entry injunction or whatever, it's clear that it came about as a result of an agreed settlement of a disputed lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.928" offset="8822660">The State of Ohio, with all of its expertise in July of 1979, made a value judgment that they should accept the agreement of Bill Kovacs to pay for some dead fish and to remove the waste stored on the surface of the site, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.959" offset="8914820">And the entry recites that that is a compromise, et cetera, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.828" offset="8930284">And the Attorney General admits that that agreement was made in full satisfaction of the obligations of Kovacs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.755" offset="8982007">Now, admittedly, the obligation to clean up the surface was not performed by Mr. Kovacs.</text>
