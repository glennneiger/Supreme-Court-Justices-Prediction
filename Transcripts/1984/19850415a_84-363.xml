            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="103.608" offset="552239">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="106.563" offset="564046">At issue in this case is the constitutionality of regional banking laws enacted by the states of Connecticut and Massachusetts which permit New England bank holding companies to enter those states and engage in full service commercial banking, but which withhold that same right from bank holding companies located in other sister states.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.664" offset="648474">The first question presented is whether the Douglas Amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act immunizes the statutes from scrutiny under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.182" offset="690479">The second question is whether these laws are part of an agreement among the states which requires Congress' approval under the Compact Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.979" offset="729662">And after briefly describing these statutes, I'd like to address all of these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.981" offset="749724">The Massachusetts and Connecticut laws permit companies from six designated New England states to enter those states and engage in full service commercial banking if the other New England state extends reciprocity to Connecticut and Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.354" offset="815239">These regional laws operate in combination with another regional law enacted by the state of Rhode Island, and together they set up a multistate common market which permits some companies to come in and denies that same right to other companies based solely on the location or the state origin of those other companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.706" offset="900608">Thus, some companies in some states get important competitive benefits which are withheld from other companies based solely on geography or state of origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.253" offset="938746">Now, these statutes in New England were designed to permit regional expansion of bank holding companies in New England while excluding companies from the neighboring state of New York, regardless of their proximity to New England and regardless of their size.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.593" offset="1000186">By the same token, companies that are in New England such as petitioner Northeast Bancorp, are unable to merger with banks located directly across the New York border.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.138" offset="1038325">The practical impact of these laws can be illustrated with a simple example.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.193" offset="1058596">Before passage of these laws, companies in Massachusetts and in New York competed on an equal basis for business in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.267" offset="1090883">Each could offer full service commercial banking in its home state, but neither could offer full service commercial banking in the state of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.782" offset="1124947">Now, however, Massachusetts companies can have full service banks both in their own home state and in the state of Connecticut, while their direct competitors in the state of New York are still limited to their one home state.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.692" offset="1176565">As the Court is aware, these regionally discriminatory laws are not an isolated phenomenon.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.965" offset="1197672">New York is flanked by the New England laws on the east, and directly to the south its neighbors are in the process of forming another exclusionary market, the Mid-Atlantic market.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.222" offset="1242707">And there is a similar combination of states in the southeast which also excludes the state of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.715" offset="1264650">We are thus witnessing a partitioning of the entire East Coast into exclusive banking zones, and as the Court is aware, some other... some 20 other states are in the process of considering regionally exclusive banking laws which would divide the countries into other regions throughout the entire nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.246" offset="1334763">Now, as the Solicitor General and the Board have acknowledged and the other respondents do not dispute, these laws would violate the Commerce Clause unless approved by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.284" offset="1374887">As this Court stated in the Eisenberg Farm case, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="313.306" offset="1390978">"The United States could not exist as a nation if each of them were to have the power to discriminate as against sister states with respect to admitting articles of commerce. "</text>
            <text syncTime="324.974" offset="1437685">"And when combinations of states jointly impose this kind of discrimination in unison, the danger of injury and divisiveness and retaliation is even greater. "</text>
            <text syncTime="335.481" offset="1479690">Now, where there is this kind of a threat to the core purposes of the Commerce Clause, this Court's decisions require proof that Congress unmistakably gave its consent to otherwise invalid state legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.611" offset="1532248">And that, we say, is a burden which respondents cannot sustain in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.132" offset="1550325">The Solicitor General on the one hand has made the argument that the plain language of the Douglas Amendment permits this kind of discrimination among sister states.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.560" offset="1592016">But all that the Douglas Amendment says is that the Board may not approve an acquisition unless there is a state law in existence which permits the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.915" offset="1629424">It doesn't say a single word about the various kinds of laws which a state might adopt, and it certainly doesn't say that a state in lifting the federal ban is free to pick and choose among sister states or to join into a regional confederation which sets up a preferential trade zone for some states and excludes the others.</text>

            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="392.188" offset="1706537">But doesn't the very paucity of language, Mr. Shapiro, suggest that the states were given very wide latitude; that all Congress was interested in was state approval?</text>

            <text syncTime="400.202" offset="1738616">To the contrary, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.794" offset="1744990">When Congress defers to the states in this manner with general language of this sort, the Court has made it quite clear that the presumption is that Congress means to defer to constitutionally valid state law; and when it refers to state law in these very general terms, the negative ingredients of the dormant Commerce Clause are part and parcel of the state law to which Congress has deferred.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="423.818" offset="1833074">Well, Mr Shapiro, I suppose the McCarran-Ferguson Act doesn't really make it unmistakably clear that states can adopt reciprocal discriminatory taxes, and yet, the Court upheld that power in cases like Western and Southern.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_m_shapiro" startTime="444.802" stopTime="541.495">
            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="444.802" offset="1916980">That's a very important question, and the distinction is between night and day; and let me explain that.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.735" offset="1936728">In the McCarran-Ferguson Act, the statute explicitly says not only that the states may regulate, but that the silence of Congress shall not be deemed to be any barrier to regulation or taxation of insurance within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.416" offset="1991481">And the legislative history, of course, was that this was an area that traditionally had not been treated as part of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.249" offset="2018753">And then in 1944 this Court changed the construction on that question, and all of a sudden state laws across the country were exposed to Commerce Clause challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.454" offset="2051563">Congress acted within one year to pass this law which expressly stated that it was lifting the negative implications of the dormant Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.621" offset="2088239">So you have unmistakable language, and you have unmistakable language in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.443" offset="2107569">And we say there is nothing remotely resembling that in the Douglas Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.356" offset="2127213">Now, our brothers, the private respondents, have made the somewhat different argument here on the authorization point, that Congress' division of the banking industry along state lines is such a splintering or such a balkanization that the states should be free to pick and choose among sister states and set up their own regional lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.749" offset="2204745">But this also is directly in the teeth of recent decisions of this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.372" offset="2223239">In the Bacchus case, decided only last term, federal law had balkanized the entire industry along state lines, had given the states plenary power to permit or not permit the importation of liquor, and yet that was not sufficient to displace the requirements of the Commerce Clause with respect to discriminatory state taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="541.495" offset="2303801">Well, Mr. Shapiro, suppose it were perfectly clear, that the Douglas Amemdment was perfectly clear to the effect that the state may pick and choose?</text>

            <text syncTime="932.350" offset="3867177">Now, they tried to find this unmistakable consent from the legislative history, and the Court has warned against reliance on fragments from the legislative history to reach issues such as consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.019" offset="3909809">But there is no question that this legislative history does refer to state discretion and to state policy and certainly supports the view that the states may lift the federal ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.616" offset="3956203">But it doesn't say a single word about the right of the states to pick and choose among sister states or to enter into multistate exclusive banking federations, and it doesn't say a single word about relinquishing the protection of the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.445" offset="4011582">Now, respondents also have made the argument here that the Board was entitled to deference when it addressed the issue of authorization, but the Board made specific findings about its own statute which we say completely undercut respondent's submissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.135" offset="4070305">The Board found that the Douglas Amendment</text>

            <text syncTime="994.381" offset="4115341">"no discussion of the power of the states to discriminate against potential out of state interests. "</text>
            <text syncTime="999.556" offset="4136030">Now, the Board did say, of course, that the Douglas Amendment is a renunciation of all federal interest in the subject of interstate bank acquisitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.081" offset="4170093">But with great respect to my friends at the Board, this is certainly an erroneous overstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.323" offset="4187021">Federal law prescribes a host of statutory criteria and policies applicable to interstate bank acquisitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.428" offset="4215442">In this very case the Board had to look at competition, potential competition, managerial resources, service to the community and other standards prescribed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.025" offset="4253894">And besides this, even if there were a total retreat from the field by the federal government, which there certainly isn't, it would be beside the point because when Congress retreats and defers to state law, it is deferring to valid state law consistent with the principles of the Commerce Clause, as this Court has said repeatedly in recent terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="1283.021" offset="5269848">Those bills were not enacted, and at the end of the last Congress, the House and the Senate disagreed in the most fundamental terms about the shape that legislation should take in this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.678" offset="5372457">Now, if the Court were to hold here that Congress approved these state laws sub silentio 30 years ago, that would largely moot the policy debate before Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.125" offset="5414253">Before Congress would have a chance to finish its hearings on its this subject, numerous acquisitions would be consummated under existing state regional banking laws.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="1706.409" offset="6963419">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.881" offset="6973345">Let me clarify first of all that this brief I have in my hand is filed on behalf of the federal respondent in this case, the Federal Reserve Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.806" offset="7008976">There is in this record some indication that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and one other member of the Board have some qualms about the policy, the soundness of the policy that has been reflected in the three orders that are at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.392" offset="7099360">And also, as the Board's opinion reflects, there is some confusion at the Board concerning the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.370" offset="7147216">We simply submit these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.211" offset="7154635">First of all, the fact that in the face of their policy concerns... and that's on page A-1-99 of the Appendix to the Certiorari Petition... and in the face of those constitutional concerns that the Board would still conclude unequivocally that these statutes are covered by the Douglas Amendment, makes all the stronger the conclusion that this is an instance in which the Board has lent its expertise to the particular item, the only item on which the Board's expertise... on which the Board is entitled to expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.356" offset="7307190">It is not on the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.238" offset="7314714">It is rather on the statutory interpretation issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.439" offset="7331536">The position of the Government is as stated, and insofar as the position of the Board is concerned, this doesn't need to be stated, but it is in the brief that the three orders of the Federal Reserve Board at issue in this case which set forth its position, and that's the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.159" offset="7390364">What the Board did is what we as the Government are defending in this particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.984" offset="7417741">The only Commerce Clause issue in this case is identical to the statutory question, and the key to decision is how much burden-lifting flexibility did Congress intend to allow the states and did Congress allow the states to exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.874" offset="7493287">Now, the petitioners contend that the states were limited to a choice between two polar extremes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.180" offset="7522544">They could either leave this Congress' total ban in place, or they could lift it completely; but they had no middle ground alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.785" offset="7552950">And we profoundly disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.737" offset="7560683">In our view it is very clear that what Congress intended to do and what Congress did do was to permit each individual state to tailor its own commerce-enhancing package to its own needs to identify that point along the regulatory spectrum between complete prohibition, complete permissiveness that best comports with that state's policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.502" offset="7651798">It is a view that is solidly supported by all three of the traditional guides to statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.935" offset="7673532">Most important, that's what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.548" offset="7687951">Now, the petitioners complain that Congress did not speak with sufficient clarity, but I submit that that argument only confuses clarity with specificity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.573" offset="7728075">The Douglas Amendment could not be more clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.177" offset="7738524">It could not be expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.558" offset="7748033">And within any reasonable view of the ordinary meaning of the language, the applications that the Board approved in this case were specifically authorized by the statute laws of the state in which the bank was located.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.005" offset="7793799">What the petitioners are really contending, therefore, is that Congress is constitutionally required not only to speak with clarity, but also to spell out the details of the circumstances under which the states may act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.995" offset="7853776">It is an argument which would interpret the Commerce Clause as a significant limitation on Congress' power to regulate commerce, because Congress really had two policy options available to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.185" offset="7918560">On the one hand, it could have, as it did, delegate to the states the power to do... enact general... it could have delegated a rather general power to the states to enact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.344" offset="7979164">On the other hand, Congress could have specifically spelled out the details of the kinds of statutory authority that the states were to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.781" offset="8016885">And in choosing between those two, the choice between those two was a significant policy alternative available to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.648" offset="8048336">What the petitioners are really saying is that the Commerce Clause limited Congress to only one of those two alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.511" offset="8075817">It is an argument that is squarely rejected by the McCarran-Ferguson Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.605" offset="8092222">It is true in McCarran-Ferguson that there also Congress dealt in very general language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.851" offset="8121166">"The business of insurance shall be subject to the laws of the several states. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.502" offset="8131824">And the fact that Congress in another section said and we really mean it, does not alter the fact that Congress did not specifically authorize the states to enact, for example, retaliatory laws such as were involved in Western and Southern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.890" offset="8185323">And this Court in Western and Southern specifically noted... and I quote...</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.383" offset="8203295">"that the unequivocal language of the Act suggests no exception. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.795" offset="8220954">And that also specifically describes the circumstance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.439" offset="8239553">Congress elected to impose the specificity requirement on the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.122" offset="8258256">It was the states that were required to be specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.795" offset="8272990">It did not elect to impose that obligation on itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.687" offset="8292529">This approach, I submit, of leaving important segments of banking policy for resolution by the states is hardly a new approach to American banking, and the distinctive aspect of American banking is highly relevant to the constitutional issue, because it's relevant to the statutory interpretation issue for at least 150 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.152" offset="8378420">Ever since the death of the Second National Bank in 1836, the cornerstone of American banking, in stark contrast to the rest of the world, has been localized control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.717" offset="8412692">The number of commercial banks in the United States is somewhere between 14,000 and 15,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.331" offset="8435053">The same number in Canada, by contrast, is 11, and the United Kingdom is 36.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.676" offset="8460444">It is a tradition that imposes some efficiency costs, but it also provides some benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.899" offset="8481342">As this Court observed in Philadelphia National Bank and in the Phillipsburg Bank case, that is the cornerstone of American banking tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.004" offset="8517809">The local banker, the banker who makes the loan decision, is a person who lives in the local community, and as the Court observed in Phillipsburg, often makes loans on the basis of what he knows about the character of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.545" offset="8579981">Many persons' banking needs are best met by a continuation of that kind of a scheme, by a banker who is a member of the local community and who knows local people and local needs and can respond to them on a personal, individualized basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.452" offset="8631599">Now, by contrast, other persons' needs, to be sure, are best served by the broader range of services that can be offered only by larger banks located in metropolitan areas; and the mix of those needs will necessarily vary from place to place and from state to state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.435" offset="8707563">The central feature of the Douglas Amendment is that it permits each state to work out its own mix; that is, to maintain localized control over banking to the extent that localized control is in that state's best interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.466" offset="8767644">And in this case Massachusetts and Connecticut have simply exercised that leeway by opting neither for total localized banking, nor for complete, uninhibited interstate banking, but a middle ground alternative between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.196" offset="8830547">In the face of interstate banking as a very real possibility as a future prospect, it was certainly rational for these two states to prepare themselves for it by experimenting with a regional banking middle ground, an experiment which would at lesser costs acquaint them with some of the problems associated with departures from the local banking model that they know best, and at the same time would better inform their later decision whether interstate banking or anything other than the local banking approach would best serve their people's needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.380" offset="8987282">That's what the Douglas Amendment provides for the states, and that's what they have... that's what they have taken advantage of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.206" offset="9022599">The legislative history is brief, and it clearly confirms that Congress meant what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.610" offset="9048199">I disagree with Mr. Shapiro.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.472" offset="9059693">These are not just fragments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.784" offset="9064918">Well, they're fragments in the sense that they're brief, but they're not fragments in the sense that... the legislative history here is entitled to a good deal more deference than is usually given to comments made on the floor, because since the Douglas Amendment was only a floor amendment, the comments made on the floor are the only legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.550" offset="9160003">That's all there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.381" offset="9163347">There's only about seven or eight pages of it, and it can be fairly briefly read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.834" offset="9177140">And the overwhelming conclusion that one comes away with when reading that legislative history is that the states were to be in charge and that Senator Douglas and other supporters of the legislation were well aware of this tradition of local banking, and that's what they meant to preserve.</text>

            <text syncTime="2293.917" offset="9313499">And that's the distinction that needs to be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.308" offset="9323008">This unconstitutional limitation pertains to something other than the Commerce Clause itself, because Congress clearly does have the authority to shape the extent to which the states may enhance commerce... the movement of goods and services across interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.030" offset="9401897">But insofar as the Commerce Clause is concerned, the argument that what Congress intended to do was to authorize only otherwise valid state laws simply ignores the thrust of the Commerce Clause, and any attempt to structure a separate constitutional argument insofar as the Commerce Clause is concerned from the Douglas Amendment itself is--</text>

            <text syncTime="2346.909" offset="9525404">--Well, I think it would once again come back to whether that was or was not a commerce-related concern, and that's also, Justice Stevens, why Mr. Shapiro's attempted distinction between this restriction, this geographic restriction and the reciprocity restriction or the grandfathering provisions or any others just won't wash.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.392" offset="9599383">Because in any event what you have when one of the states lifts the burden to an extent but not total, you have left in place a scheme under which there is a segment of state business that is available to in-staters but is unavailable to out-of-staters, and that's what under this Court's precedents is a per se violation of the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.627" offset="9688304">Now, finally, Justice White is absolutely right that the petitioners have the burden of showing that their view is the only permissible one, because the agency charged with the implementation of this statute has consistently entered orders approving acquisitions in all cases where state statutes specifically permit the particular type of interstate acquisition before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.884" offset="9789345">And that includes not just these geographic limitations but also the substantive limitations where someone can come in from outside but can only engage in the credit card business, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.542" offset="9839919">The fact that the members... that the Board may not have understood that its interpretation of the Douglas Amendment in this unique constitutional setting also determines the constitutional question is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.811" offset="9889029">It has interpreted the Douglas Amendment, and our defense before this Court is a defense of the orders that the Court entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.325" offset="9923092">And the Court not only through it orders but also through its opinions made it very clear that notwithstanding its policy misgivings, notwithstanding its constitutional misgivings, concluded that these orders fell squarely within the scope of what Congress intended the states to be able to do under the Douglas Amendment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Henry Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="2499.811" offset="10136983">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.584" offset="10152134">I would like, if I might, to first clear away what I think is some confusion about the Compact Clause, because I don't think it really belongs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.138" offset="10182332">When Justice O'Connor asked Mr. Shapiro what exactly have Massachusetts and Connecticut agreed to, and there was a pause, and then we were told, well, they've agreed to reciprocity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.614" offset="10224232">Notice, this Court has held, of course, in Beaux v. Barrett, 1953 that reciprocity alone doesn't make something the kind of compact Congress need approve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.952" offset="10265610">The key point is they're complaining of the proposed exclusion of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.335" offset="10287135">There isn't any suggestion in this case that there is a reciprocal agreement to exclude New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.109" offset="10314198">Reciprocity means you let us in, we'll let you in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.181" offset="10326528">But there's no basis whatever for arguing that there is an exclusionary agreement in this case, and there's been no response whatever by the petitioners to our argument that indeed as long ago as 1896, this Court expressly ruled that no approval by Congress is needed under the Compact Clause where legislation on the part of two or more states reciprocally permits corporate entities to enter one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.368" offset="10427256">I think the Compact Clause is a nonissue here, and I think Justice White is surely correct that the whole question is what power did Congress delegate to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.854" offset="10465185">Now, as Justice Rehnquist indicates, the paucity of language about restrictions here cuts only one way, and this Court in Justice Brennan's opinion in Western and Southern I think made clear which way it cuts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.812" offset="10513042">When there are no limitations placed in an open-ended grant of authority to the states, that means that Congress meant what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.478" offset="10555674">Now, that is absolutely clear here where Congress could readily have imposed limitations and indeed impose one, namely that the burden lifting action by the states, tailoring their own commerce-enhancing package, as General Lee puts it so well, that that step must be taken by state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.621" offset="10640310">And moreover, quite apart from the unambiguous language here, I would say far clearer and far more explicit than the statement about the implications of silence in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, we have here a case where the legislative history, far from fragmentary, is literally overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.436" offset="10723484">The sponsors, Douglas and Paine, spoke about leaving it to the states' discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.861" offset="10749189">The floor manager of the bill, Roberston, said that if you believe in states' rights, you've got to go this way because if you accept the House version of the bill, you don't give the states leeway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.588" offset="10796105">The opponents of the bill made the argument that Mr. Shapiro is making here: that it is discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.563" offset="10824003">Senator Brucher opposed the bill on the grounds that it gave states new powers to restrict bank holding companies that entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.108" offset="10862247">That's on page 674 of the Joint Appendix of the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.182" offset="10878547">It seems to me that in this case in particular, the statements of a legislator who sponsored the bill are entitled to special weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.976" offset="10909685">The petitioners in their brief cite language from this Court's opinion in Chrysler v. Brown, saying that what a legislator says may not be decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.701" offset="10944585">But more recently, this Court in Northhaven against Bell made quite clear in Justice Blackmun's opinion for the Court that although that's sometimes true, the remarks of a Senator who is the sponsor of the language ultimately enacted are, in this Court's words,</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.502" offset="11007801">"an authoritative guide to the statute's construction. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.325" offset="11023056">when the matter comes up on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.056" offset="11037999">So it seems to me clear that if, as Justice White asks, there is only one construction permissible, I think I know what it is, and that is Congress meant what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.374" offset="11071226">The States could lift selectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.585" offset="11080108">And I think, conversely, if more than one construction is permissible, there ought to be deference to the expertise of the Board on the meaning of the statute that it has uniformly administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.911" offset="11125456">But I do want to turn to the image that petitioners would deploy in this Court to somehow make it appear as though what the states are doing here or what they are authorized to do does entail something like Justice Stevens' concern about an unconstitutional condition, a kind of gerrymander, picking and choosing perhaps among various states, as though Massachusetts and Connecticut through their statutes brandished the slogan "We hate New York".</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.718" offset="11228692">Nothing of that sort is going on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.721" offset="11236634">There's a decision to respect the historic cultural and economic boundaries of the region, the New England region, hardly an artifact of anyone's imagination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2820.860" offset="11421267">But here, interestingly, both the Board and the Second Circuit on an ample record found that that was not the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.075" offset="11450106">The reason rather was a well-calculated decision to foster a limited experiment preserving diversity and stability in a system at one and the same time responsive to local needs and yet likely to build up enough indigenous entities to resist the coming onslaught.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Henry Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="2987.499" offset="12087808">I think that under the Equal Protection Clause in Shapiro Congress couldn't delegate to them the power invidiously to pick and choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.764" offset="12112885">But even after Metropolitan Life, which in this twelfth hour attempt they might want to resurrect, even after Metropolitan Life, the point is that there is no challenge whatever by the petitioners to the findings either of the Board or of the Second Circuit that there was a reasonable basis for the line drawn, if that were an issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.627" offset="12192297">And if Justice Stevens' suggestion is right and that is not an issue, then a fortiori theres' no question that need be decided, especially since it is clear that Congress delegated this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.074" offset="12230123">But there is a question that is raised by petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.764" offset="12240885">They say isn't it amazing that Congress didn't say so if it wanted the states to have this latitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.598" offset="12264186">It's not at all amazing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.950" offset="12269620">On the contrary, there are several fundamental answers as to why this Court ought not to depart from its precedents in Prudential v. Benjamin and Western and Southern and demand specificity and a kind of laundry list, as well as clarity of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.378" offset="12331269">For one thing, there's an historical reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.320" offset="12343076">Congress in 1956, as the petitioners have never denied, was expressly told some bankers believe that regional approaches are a good idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.467" offset="12379648">And as we explain in our brief at pages 21 to 22, the only reason Congress then didn't mandate that solution was not disagreement with its potential wisdom, but a sense that it would override state discretion excessively to force that approach upon the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.690" offset="12456552">In addition, there are practical considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.652" offset="12468359">As this Court held less than three weeks ago in Town of Halley, the way legislatures work and the way that statutes are written makes it unrealistic to expect a legislature to catalog.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.140" offset="12514335">There is finally, and I think most importantly, a reason of principle, and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.845" offset="12541189">If Congress is to be the ultimate protector of the states as autonomous laboratories, especially after this Court's decision in Garcia, we're to look to Congress, then when Congress chooses to protect the autonomy of the states as laboratories, not by telling them which formulas they may experiment with and which they may not, but by leaving it to them subject to an unconstitutional conditions doctrine, for this Court to deny effect to that explicit, substantive congressional judgment would at one and the same time deal a blow to natural legislative supremacy and to the sovereignty and autonomy of the states as laboratories in the interest, so far as I can tell, of an aesthetic concern that all states are created equal, even when, as in this case, limiting the region to New England has the effect of excluding 53 of the nation's 54 largest bank holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.156" offset="12798443">Now, we can imagine no purpose to be served by suddenly declaring this perfectly reasonable step by the states of Massachusetts and Connecticut to be outside the reach of the very broad authorization delegated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.936" offset="12857479">And if there were any doubt about the proper reading of the statute, deferring to the statutory reading that the Board has given in the face of its own policy misgivings is surely the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.770" offset="12896872">And if one says why shouldn't we let Congress resolve it, I thin the answer to that is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.554" offset="12919964">Congress did in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.536" offset="12931876">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3206.694" offset="12964581">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.362" offset="12967194">Counsel's remark about our position being a mere aesthetic concern about the equal status of the states in the Union ought to be the starting point for my rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.588" offset="13004183">This isn't a mere aesthetic concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.471" offset="13011706">As the Court said in the Eisenberg case, we could not exist as a nation if states could pick and choose among sister states, and a fortiori, when groups of states join together to boycott other states and effectively injure their economies, this goes to the very core of the concerns of the Founding Fathers that made us one nation of co-equal and indestructible states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.485" offset="13095716">Now, respondents' position is that Congress meant to approve this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.065" offset="13110031">It meant to approve the ganging up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.628" offset="13116301">It meant to approve the picking and choosing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.758" offset="13124764">It meant to set aside the protections of the Commerce Clause without a single word to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.392" offset="13147334">The Court should not mistake what's being asked for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.673" offset="13156425">This is a giant step beyond what Congress ever considered, what Congress ever stated in the history or in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.240" offset="13186727">And it is the better part of wisdom, we say, to leave this issue to Congress, which is now considering whether this is good or bad for the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.763" offset="13216820">And if we're all patient, we think Congress will come to a sensible resolution considering the interests of all concerned.</text>
