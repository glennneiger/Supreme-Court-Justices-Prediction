            <text syncTime="69.441" offset="403958">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="72.268" offset="415243">In this companion case we are concerned with a body of water commonly labeled the Mississippi Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.218" offset="455053">It's a long, elongated, sausage-like strip of water off the coast of Mississippi and Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.900" offset="493819">It is some 80 miles long and at most 10 miles wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.507" offset="516180">It's perhaps most clearly illustrated in the map... the first of the maps at the back of our exceptions, and I have no quarrel with the comparable map which has been distributed, I think, at the bench on behalf of Mississippi and Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.593" offset="600503">But referring to our Chart 1, the Court will see that it's defined, Mississippi Sound, at the east by Mobile Bay, a discrete, separate body of water, and at the west by something called Lake Borgne.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.398" offset="675736">And when I say 80 miles long, I do not include either Lake Borgne or Mobile Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.643" offset="716696">Now, referring to the second of our charts to indicate what is disputed and what is not disputed, we of course concede that Mobile Bay at the east is an inland water of Alabama, a juridical bay, and at the west Lake Borgne and that portion of the Mississippi Sound which is hashed, which goes from Isle Au Pitre to the north towards one of the headlands of St. Louis Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.656" offset="904777">The portion to the west of that is likewise inland water.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.749" offset="917212">What is in controversy, therefore, is that long, thin strip in between, defined by those two inland bodies of water at the east and west and by what are called the Barrier Islands at the south; that is, Cat Island, Ship Island, Horn Island, Petit Bois Island, and Dauphin.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.584" offset="1008536">Now, the claim was that this area constitutes a juridical bay under Article 7 of the International Convention and, independently, alternatively, that it is historic inland water.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.965" offset="1106025">The Special Master appointed by this Court concluded that it was enclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.289" offset="1131311">We challenge each of those conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.382" offset="1147716">Now, straight away I should say that the result in this case may seem perfectly sensible, perfectly reasonable, because that area looks somewhat enclosed, sheltered by those islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.654" offset="1224830">One Tight say why shouldn't that be treated as inland water?</text>
            <text syncTime="279.294" offset="1243324">The answer is that as a matter of international law it could indeed be treated as inland water.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.166" offset="1266835">It is a textbook example of an instance where straight baselines under Article 4 of the Convention would be appropriately drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.208" offset="1306959">But as I said in the previous case, this Court quite emphatically twice, in the California case and in the Louisiana case, held that the question whether to invoke that straight baseline way of enclosing inland waters is one to be made by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.404" offset="1383759">It is not reviewable by this Court, and in this, as in all other instances, the United States, for good or bad reasons, has determined not to invoke that way of enclosing inland water.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.773" offset="1445303">And that decision cannot be got round, as is sought to be done here, by creating a bay out of islands... a thing which this Court has firmly said may not be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.815" offset="1501414">Now, recognizing that, the Master looked to see whether he could find a bay that would satisfy the rules of the Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.745" offset="1561182">First, he addressed the question of juridical bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.994" offset="1574139">Now, when you look at this area, it doesn't look like a bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.696" offset="1596918">It's too long and too thin, and normally wouldn't satisfy any of the tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.614" offset="1624608">However, if one is willing to indulge in contrivances, one can eke out a bay because one can draw an opposing line anchored on the islands, thereby the distance, the water distance, both for the purpose of the 24-mile line and for the purpose of the semi-circle test... both things permissible under the Convention.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="436.091" offset="1870577">Just over 24 miles, which is why one has to talk about Dauphin Island, which is the key to the juridical bay argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.587" offset="1900565">It is, the Master himself concluded, that unless Dauphin Island could be assimilated to the mainland, there is no juridical bay here, except, of course, Mobile Bay and a portion of lake Borgne to the west and the little discrete bays which we've indicated at the north.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.296" offset="1979351">And so he concentrated his mind on the question: Can Dauphin Island properly be viewed as an extension of the mainland?</text>
            <text syncTime="471.419" offset="2011847">Once again, the question of distance, use of the intervening waters, and alignment of that island with the mainland were considered; but once again, as it seems to us and as we detail in our brief, those tests simply do not justify Dauphin Island as an extension of the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.265" offset="2143191">And indeed, the Master himself so concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.655" offset="2160745">And so, finding that applying the tests of the Louisiana case to Dauphin Island would not satisfy the test here, would not satisfy Dauphin Island here, the Master invoked what is a truly novel proposition, which is that when an island is separated from the mainland by inland water as opposed to territorial water or high seas, then that intervening water may be treated as land, and of course, the island becomes a peninsula... a remarkably neat, self-serving result, but one which leads to quite ridiculous results if carried out too far, as this very same Master had himself recognized ten years previously when writing his report in the Louisiana case, because Louisiana had made precisely this argument and had been rejected by him and by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.939" offset="2437956">It is of course true that inland water is in some sense assimilated to the land; that is to say, the sovereignty of the coastal state of is fully applicable to its internal or inland waters, but it hardly follows that that equality of jurisdiction turns water into land.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.305" offset="2539416">And indeed, Article 7 of the Convention in every portion of it distinguishes between land and water.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.347" offset="2575569">It measures water gaps as opposed to the land gaps in a bay, all of which are inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.906" offset="2609842">It treats those gaps differently both for the semi-circle test and for the 24-mile rule, thereby very clearly distinguishing and not confusing land and water.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.541" offset="2676297">And yet, it's quite clear that that is the prime, basic reason why the Master concluded that what was under the Louisiana case an island too far removed from land should nevertheless be treated as an extension of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.939" offset="2761979">We point out that this argument had been rejected by him in one place and, most relevantly, in the case of the Isle Dernieres in Louisiana where formation, an arm of a putative bay called Caillou Bay was sought to be constructed on that same theory; that at the eastern end those islands touched inland water and therefore were connected to land by those inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.234" offset="2919132">And indeed, in this case for reasons which I do not fully appreciate, one of the state briefs has reproduced that very submission by Louisiana rejected by the Master and rejected by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.244" offset="2983184">It's perhaps well to indicate precisely what Alabama was... and Mississippi were doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.457" offset="3040026">In the reply brief of Alabama, which is the thickest volume in the pile, there are a number of maps at the back, and the first one indicates how Alabama treats Mobile Bay as connecting Dauphin Island to the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.011" offset="3126231">There it's simply hatched.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.103" offset="3134590">And in the next one we find that Alabama... the Mobile Bay is truly assimilated to--</text>

            <text syncTime="764.584" offset="3184536">--The... and, of course, Dauphin Island then looks like an extension of the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.862" offset="3209613">Now, that is precisely what Louisiana has sought to do, as Attachment 6 to this brief illustrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.059" offset="3262381">There's Caillou Bay as... this is an exhibit Louisiana used... and the part that is hashed is mostly water... Lake Pelto and other water bodies, but inland water bodies, and therefore, said Louisiana, assimilated land.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.209" offset="3338972">It seems to us, therefore, that this argument, which has no validity independently, has been addressed by this Master and by, more relevantly, by this Court and rejected, and that accordingly, it is not a viable method for assimilating islands to land.</text>

            <text syncTime="1087.921" offset="4477806">The second holding was that the dividing line between Mississippi and Louisiana ought to be drawn in the main channel which went south of Cat Island and north of Ilse Au Pitre.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.931" offset="4533917">And the issue was whether that rule, the thalweg rule, following the navigation channel was a rule applicable only to strictly inland waters like rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.567" offset="4588461">The Court said not so; that rule can apply to arms of the sea, to lakes, to bays, to inlets, and so it seemed to territorial--</text>

            <text syncTime="1247.779" offset="5117284">But he also was then, before this Court had imported the International Convention as the governing rule, concentrating on what was a somewhat vague, but nevertheless different approach to how to define inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.958" offset="5186038">It may be that under the approach that was then in vogue, it was proper to treat inland waters as defined by a series of islands reasonably close together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.859" offset="5253643">That approach was made impossible once the United States adhered to the International Convention in 1961 and once this Court held in 1965 that that Convention governed for purposes of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.835" offset="5321561">Those two ingredients were not present when the Solicitor General somewhat casually distinguished Mississippi Sound in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.114" offset="5358655">Now, turning to the other aspects of the claim of historic inland water, it is a little odd to be claiming that this Court so decided, and therefore Mississippi Sound is historic inland water.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jim R. Bruce</label>
            <text syncTime="1719.042" offset="7002384">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.134" offset="7018684">The states take the position that the Master's findings and conclusions are eminently well founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.974" offset="7046061">They further submit that his reasoning is further reinforced by certain bases which the states have submitted in the way of exceptions merely to support the Master's ultimate finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.438" offset="7091932">In the brief time allotted to me I will address the question of the Master's finding as to Mississippi Sound as inland waters under Article 7 of the Geneva Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.371" offset="7139684">Mr. Cohen will address the treatment of Mississippi Sound as inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.056" offset="7162358">While we've separated these arguments for the purpose of presentation, we certainly invite the Court's questions as to either issue at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.133" offset="7190675">I think the most interesting thing that tends to jump out at one as you look at the map which we have submitted for the purpose of oral argument are the four patches of high seas within the territorial boundaries of the state of Mississippi and Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.093" offset="7266534">The United States takes the position in this case and a similar position in the Long Island case that all it's doing is applying the Convention, and that when the Convention is properly applied, at least in the Mississippi Sound, enclaves of high seas... in some instances no acre than six feet deep... necessarily occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.912" offset="7353783">The states would suggest that that is a selective application of the Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.157" offset="7386802">Nowhere but in a domestic dispute between the United States and a state would enclaves in fact appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.015" offset="7414283">Were a foreign nation claiming Mississippi Sound or an area such as that, the question of enclaves would never arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.730" offset="7445107">It has no international significance in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.105" offset="7454616">A foreign nation could easily validate its claim to those enclaves and to the entire sound by proper application of other provisions of the Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.413" offset="7491814">The witnesses on behalf of the United States pointed out that the Government's position did not further freedom of the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.158" offset="7538835">They further pointed out that it didn't serve an important policy consideration, and that the inclusion of Mississippi Sounds as internal waters of the state of Mississippi would not in fact extend the traditional boundaries of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.652" offset="7600797">It was also conceded that it would not jeopardize the United States' position so far as international relations in objecting to... objecting to excessive claims by foreign nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.179" offset="7646877">The questions I think that relate to Article 7 I think are most important, and I would like to correct the statement that's been made by the Solicitor's office, especially with regard to Caillou Pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.062" offset="7722423">He suggested that Caillou Bay involved a very similar situation; that is, a situation where the islands lying in the mouth of a pre-existing bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.340" offset="7759517">I believe reference to a map of this area will indicate that not to be the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.837" offset="7781564">Neither of the two islands which would have been used as headlands for the bay in fact lie at the mouth of the bay to the east.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.381" offset="7819703">I'm referring to the attachment to Mississippi... to Alabama's reply brief, Attachment No. 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.926" offset="7845826">The two large islands which jut out from the Louisiana coast at approximately a 45 degree angle do not appear in the least to be a part of a pre-existing juridical bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.247" offset="7899115">I believe Attachment No. 8 will show the western extremity or the eastern extremity of that particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.900" offset="7929731">I've looked at these maps, and I don't see the island the United States is referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.226" offset="7955122">I might also note the Court did raise a question a little bit earlier when the United States changed its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.473" offset="8000053">The Master, of course, found that the position was not announced until 1971, and of course, as late as 1979 in its litigation with Louisiana, the United States still contended that Mississippi Sound was internal waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.497" offset="8060134">And I would refer to page 39 of our brief in which we reproduced that concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.901" offset="8081764">They were again relying on Louisiana v. Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.400" offset="8095765">At another point in their brief they conceded that Mississippi Sound was different from the islands along the Louisiana coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.850" offset="8121574">They said that the islands there were islands in the open sea... a situation which was quite different from Mississippi Sound, with the clear implication being Mississippi Sound constituted islands in the mouth of the bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.283" offset="8171311">I think it's interesting that a former geographer for the State Department, Mr. Percy, back in 1959, writing just about the time that the Geneva Convention was being considered by other nations, shortly before its ratification by the United States, discussed the terms of the Convention, and he talked about islands in the mouth of a bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.039" offset="8254276">When he did, he pointed to Mississippi Sound, which he described Mississippi Sound as being one of the most impressive dimensions involving juridical bays is Mississippi Sound, partially closed off by a series of sandy islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.861" offset="8321568">The former geographer at least read the Convention to constitute a juridical bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.719" offset="8353019">Of course, Mississippi Sound has had various names in its history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.858" offset="8365558">At one time it was called Pascagoula Bay, Pascagcula Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.420" offset="8379873">As of about 1940... 1845, it was termed Mississippi Sound as a result of a government survey of the area.</text>

            <text syncTime="2207.848" offset="8957597">The... the largest area typically, historically, the tip of Ship Island where the port was built provided a small harbor for ships in the 18th and 19th centuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.375" offset="8999706">The water there I believe reached a maximum depth of about 17 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.343" offset="9015589">So that is the deepest area that I know of in the Sound.</text>

            <text syncTime="2228.917" offset="9041816">In fact, I think it's rather interesting from a historical point of view when the D'Aiberville and the early explorers were sailing in that area they would anchor outside the islands and send small boats in because of the shallowness of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.601" offset="9088627">At one point I believe D'Aiberville or somebody was able to get a boat into Ocean Springs, Mississippi, but they had to wait a considerable time before they could get the boat out or almost a change of seasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.438" offset="9139932">It was not the kind of thing that you did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.766" offset="9149231">The testimony in the record indicates that there were launches, flatbottom boats and so on that navigate this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.280" offset="9171279">The traffic you have in there is not international traffic lengthwise of the sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.622" offset="9188624">It is purely domestic, the same kind of traffic, I suppose, that the Court noticed in the Anglo-Norwegian Fisheries case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2299.095" offset="9322580">It should include Louisiana v. Mississippi, and it should also include the International Court's finding that the fringe of islands along the Norwegian coast constitute an extension of that mainland.</text>

            <text syncTime="2325.990" offset="9430100">In fact, the Court said there that there are numerous bays, straits, arms of the sea and so on, and these provide internal navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.644" offset="9456745">That was one of the factors that was taken into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.581" offset="9468448">The depth of water was another; the fact that from... from the sea they appeared to be a whole with the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.907" offset="9489764">In fact, the same factors appear in both this Court's decision in '69 and the... in the fisheries case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2478.823" offset="10041470">The distance between Cedar Point and Dauphin Island to the south is less than 1.6 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.616" offset="10072608">I think that is an important factor to consider, and that is, the distance between the island and the size of the island.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.238" offset="10103119">While 1.6 miles, as the Master noted, might have been excessive for a mud lump at the mouth of the Mississippi, we think for an island 14.75 miles long and which encloses waters to the north and meets the other criteria, certainly constitutes an extension of the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.637" offset="10168738">So far as the question about inland waters as being mainland, I think a very good instance might be the situation with a river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.882" offset="10221715">There's no doubt but what a river is a part of the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.693" offset="10232895">Although it is water, it is mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.928" offset="10241881">And the line joining the entrances to a river is certainly nonetheless mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.456" offset="10268004">In fact, it's treated the same way for a delimitation of territorial seas is mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.173" offset="10286916">Just as that is the case there, we think that the closing line for a bay, which is also internal waters, serves to... the same as mainland, and an island which adjoins a closing line would also be treated as mainland for purposes of applying Article 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.601" offset="10376568">And the real question here is not whether land is water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.787" offset="10389316">That's never been in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.084" offset="10394541">The question is whether the Convention would recognize the use of an island to help form a bay, and it does so only in a very limited situation... in a situation which this Court and the International Court of Justice have both said can only happen where the waters between are so closely related to the mainland as to be justly treated as internal waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.137" offset="10486701">We think that's the only instance where that may happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="2635.666" offset="10668826">I think it would be inland waters under either situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.150" offset="10682724">The result of the Master's recommendation we believe for several reasons is factually logical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.942" offset="10721907">The United States international law expert testified that a historic claim to Mississippi Sound would be strengthened by the fact that the Sound is totally enclosed from the open sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.265" offset="10771226">The borders of the Mississippi Sound on the north are land, on the east and west they're inland water, and on the south it's a total three-mile belt of territorial waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.840" offset="10809574">Second, this geographical configuration is a cul-de-sac.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.182" offset="10826920">As Mr. Bruce explained, there's no reason for international shipping to enter Mississippi Sound other than to go to an inland port.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.756" offset="10861192">It is not a route of passage between areas of high seas, and it is so shallow as not to be readily navigable for ocean-going vessels.</text>

            <label>Mr. Benjamin Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="2724.489" offset="11024092">Once... the Master looked at pre-admission history and post-admission history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.315" offset="11051468">He found that the United States exercised authority over Mississippi Sound beginning shortly after the United States acquired this territory from France in 1905 the Louisiana Purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.777" offset="11113326">In 1804 the United States Congress annexed the waters of the Mississippi Sound into a customs district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.806" offset="11141434">From that time forward Congress considered those waters as internal waters and proposed in about 1817 the Intracoastal Waterway between Mobile and New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.411" offset="11195768">Those incidents are consistent with the background reasons why nations claim historic bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.579" offset="11232444">It's natural for a nation to lay claim to an area that is adjacent to its coast that is important for reason of economy or vital reasons of security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.340" offset="11279569">Congress then established that Intracoastal Waterway, which is the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.226" offset="11311125">Considering that congressional activity, which continued from about 1803 until the turn of the century, and then this Court decided the Louisiana v. Mississippi case in 1905.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.909" offset="11369848">And from that time I don't believe there has been any... any question about the inland water status of the Mississippi Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.717" offset="11409032">As it was pointed out earlier, the Solicitor General, based on Louisiana v. Mississippi, believed that Mississippi Sound was inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.681" offset="11460859">I believe the... the Master found in this case that the United States had exercised jurisdiction over Mississippi Sound, and that that exercise had been continuous, and that foreign nations had acquiesced in that exercise, and that they knew or should have known of the claim being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.375" offset="11551661">The two issues in this case that go to the heart of the dispute between the states and the United States is whether there was a claim to inland waters made and whether nations knew or reasonably should have known that that claim had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.475" offset="11628043">All of these relate directly to the common sense recommendations of the Master's and the geographical configuration of the Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.754" offset="11661166">I'd like to discuss in a little bit more detail the Louisiana v. Mississippi opinion, the 1905 opinion of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.705" offset="11697006">As an opinion of this Court of course it is notice to the world, notice to foreign nations of the claim made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.060" offset="11726368">As was pointed out, in order to decide that case, the Court had to apply the doctrine of thalweg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.087" offset="11762521">The doctrine of thalweg only applies in inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.211" offset="11775060">The issue in that case was to decide whether the boundary line between Louisiana and Mississippi would lie in a deepwater sailing channel between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.409" offset="11823857">The Court applied thalweg and found that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.221" offset="11835037">In so doing, the Court extended a lateral state boundary over Lake Borgne and over Mississippi Sound to the Gulf of Mexico, which it found to lie south of the Barrier Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.214" offset="11891044">And, in essence, it acknowledged and recognized the United States exercise of authority over Mississippi Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.789" offset="11929287">As I mentioned earlier, the Master, believing that this Court found that Mississippi Sound was inland waters, also believed that congressional actions from 1803 until the turn of the century also believed that the waters were inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.455" offset="12003997">The third basis of the Master's opinion was that the United States had had a consistent policy in the international community to enclose waters of the type as Mississippi Sound as inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.352" offset="12075573">This the Master referred to commonly as the ten-mile rule, which is basically a rule that inland waters of the United States which are straits or sound which lead to other bodies of inland water, which are no more than ten miles wide, should be dealt with and enclosed as inland water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.265" offset="12163240">The policy that created this situation was established in approximately 1903, which is approximately the same time as this Court decided Louisiana v. Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.806" offset="12225411">That in a sense continues the United States exercise of authority from 1903 up until that policy was dropped in approximately 1961 with the adoption of the Geneva Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.487" offset="12288105">The Master's analysis of this rule was quite similar to the International Court of Justice Analysis of a similar rule in the Anglo-Norwegian Fisheries case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.889" offset="12337737">In that case there were two issues: whether the Norwegian government's standard of delimitation of territorial waters was correct under international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.633" offset="12388728">The court found that it was, but once finding that, they turned to the question of whether the waters behind that line could be treated historically as inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.847" offset="12437525">In our situation this is basically what the Master did concerning the United States policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.312" offset="12467409">Both the Master and the International Court of Justice found that there was a general policy to delimit inland waters and that these policies had been continuous, and that foreign nations were well aware of those policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.524" offset="12524252">In fact, in both situations... in the Norway situation there was a request from France asking what was your policy in delimiting waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.225" offset="12563122">In the United States situation there was a request from Norway asking what is your policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.099" offset="12582557">So without question, foreign nations were well aware of both policies.</text>

            <text syncTime="3124.016" offset="12622263">In addition to that, both the Master and the International Court of Justice relied on an opinion of the supreme court of the country, the respective country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.088" offset="12682554">In Norway it was the St. Juste case, and of course in this situation it's the Louisiana v. Mississippi case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.568" offset="12716408">Both found that the subject waters... that the dispute of the subject waters were historic inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.829" offset="12761444">So we submit that the Master's recommendation in this case is, above all, logical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.280" offset="12787253">We believe it is factually and legally correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.405" offset="12799791">We believe that the recommendations should be accepted, and the Master's analysis should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.505" offset="12884219">Mr. Chief Justice:</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.740" offset="12889130">With respect to the concession by the Solicitor General in respect to Mississippi Sound, of course there was a comparable concession in the very case with respect to Caillou Bay; and this Court quite expressly held that that was not binding, nor evidence of any historic inland water claim for that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.339" offset="12979514">The International Court of Justice in the Norwegian case did not hold that they were extensions of the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.851" offset="13017548">It held that a nation may enclose islands with a straight baseline, and the international community adopted that rule in Article 4 of the 1958 Convention after the International Court had vindicated the principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.798" offset="13081391">And that is, of course, the appropriate role if it were chosen by the United States in this case to enclose Mississippi Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.685" offset="13116918">The United States has chosen not to, and what this case is is an effort to circumvent that decision not to enclose Mississippi Sound in accordance with principles vindicated by international law, but optional principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.570" offset="13168431">Now, Mississippi in 1905 was arguing that Mississippi Sound was high seas so that the thalweg rule would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.521" offset="13204271">We don't tax them with being bound by that any more than we are by what the Solicitor General said in 1957 or '58.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.891" offset="13233737">I should point out that in the so-called exchanges of correspondence diplomatically there is not a single instance in which any representative of the United States addressing a foreign government pinpointed Mississippi Sound as inland water, nor was that area marked, as it should have been under Article 4, as inland water on our large-scale maps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.742" offset="13333107">There were some generalized statements about how we treat and define inland waters which could, extrapolated, mean that somebody might conclude that Mississippi Sound was covered by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.174" offset="13382844">But that is the extent of it, and that is simply not evidence clear beyond doubt in the face of a clear disclaimer by the United States sufficient under this Court's cases to make out a case of historic water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.496" offset="13440105">Much stronger cases were made by California, by Florida, by Louisiana, and they failed... and indeed by Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.603" offset="13472601">This, by comparison, is a weaker case and ought not prevail.</text>
