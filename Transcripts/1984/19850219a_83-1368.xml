            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="143450">We will hear arguments first this morning in Northwest Wholesale Stationers against Pacific Stationery and Printing Co.--</text>
            <text syncTime="12.224" offset="192247">Mr. Sweeney, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. David J. Sweeney</label>
            <text syncTime="15.093" offset="203741">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the petitioner Northwest Wholesale Stationers is a non-profit purchasing cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.763" offset="238431">It pools the collective buying ability of its members to achieve larger aggregate purchases, thus lowering prices to its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.436" offset="269151">At year end, what would be profits are distributed to its members as rebates, which are exempt from being categorized as price discrimination under the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.291" offset="308544">The members of the cooperative are retail stationery stores located throughout the five western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.897" offset="334980">There is nothing in the record which demonstrates what market impact or power the cooperative had or in fact the definition of what the market is.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.920" offset="375104">The respondent Pacific Stationery is a wholesaler-retailer combination, and used its cooperative membership for purchases of odd lot and round out items when it could not stock them in its own wholesale inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.644" offset="425990">It had additional sources of supply from manufacturers and other suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.881" offset="442918">After Pacific's ownership changed, it filed another membership application.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.701" offset="466219">That application was denied, although they were informed that they could continue to purchase from the cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.272" offset="488475">Pacific then filed a Sherman One antitrust lawsuit alleging that a group boycott had occurred, that its denial of cooperative membership in the absence of a due process hearing constituted a per se violation under liability theory based on Silver versus the New York Stock Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.751" offset="566425">At the District Court level on cross motions for summary judgment, the District Court dismissed plaintiff's claim, reasoning that Pacific failed to submit any evidence showing a restraint on competition as distinguished from alleged unilateral harm to itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.195" offset="640194">The Ninth Circuit, in a divided opinion, reversed, finding per se liability for the cooperative's actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.718" offset="670288">It stated that termination in the absence of a hearing made the practice so likely to be anticompetitive that it was per se unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.740" offset="706337">Our petition followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.942" offset="719189">The recent decisions of this Court make it clear that under either a rule of reason or a per se analysis, the goal is to form a judgment about the competitive significance of conduct, that courts must view the purpose and effect on competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.452" offset="785226">The Ninth Circuit should be reversed because it found per se liability under a simplistic analysis which simply characterized the conduct instead of viewing what actual effect, if any, the conduct had.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.294" offset="840606">In recent cases, this Court has authorized the use of an analysis of competitive impact: What is the economic reality which occurred as a result of the conduct?</text>

            <text syncTime="210.134" offset="983966">The only factual impact in the record is the loss of rebate, which amounted to approximately $9,800.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.442" offset="1033181">That was the $9,800 in its last year with the cooperative.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.631" offset="1065886">There is nothing in the record that would indicate what effect the loss of that rebate had on Pacific unilaterally as a competitor.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.053" offset="2151639">We believe the lower courts, in line with the Court's recent decision, should now be given the tools of analysis for a joint venture or joint actions, so that a trial court can deter truly anticompetitive conduct without risking harm to joint conduct which is procompetitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.852" offset="2246830">The courts already recognize that boycotts are not a unitary phenomenon.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.656" offset="2266056">As a starting point, this Court could confirm that not all conduct which definitionally could be called a concerted refusal to deal, is deserving of per se treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.236" offset="2348394">We would submit that in line with the Court's opinion in GT Sylvania, followed up last term by Jefferson Parish and NCAA, the trial court could make a threshold analysis of competitive impact, which may likely require a market definition before characterizing the conduct as rule of reason or that which would merit per se condemnation.</text>

            <text syncTime="695.112" offset="2923819">If he can't come forward with any plausible efficiency-enhancing argument, then in fact per se condemnation may be appropriate, but at that point when the plaintiff meets his burden of going forward and showing that there is some anticompetitive impact, then the defendant should be given the opportunity to say why he engaged in this conduct, and if in fact there is a plausible argument for it, then a rule of reason trial should ensue so that whatever restraint exists can be balanced against the pro-competitive arguments that the defendant may have.</text>

            <text syncTime="1017.704" offset="4214163">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the fundamental reason for concern in this case from the government's perspective is that an overly literal application of the per se group boycott label to conduct of joint ventures threatens to substantially undercut their procompetitive potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.332" offset="4288769">This Court has often observed that group boycotts are per se illegal, but is has only characterized conduct as a group boycott in cases involving an attempt to eliminate rivalry in the sense of an attempt to exclude a competitor from the market or to eliminate a form of competition such as price discounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.412" offset="4369017">The group boycott or concerted refusal to deal label, however, literally covers a wide variety of conduct, and that conduct can range from the seriously anticompetitive to the substantially procompetitive.</text>

            <text syncTime="2089.255" offset="8500439">That is, the presence of a self-regulation duty, in that case imposed by the Securities Exchange Act, might have converted what was otherwise unlawful into lawful conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="3663.179" offset="14796159">The exclusion of a wholesaler-retailer combination I think can be justified economically on a number of different grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.717" offset="14830222">A wholesaler will always have the ability to purchase because of its wholesaling ability at the same level that the cooperative would, so that the the wholesaler-retailer combination, it can feed that retailer through its wholesaling arm, whereas going through the cooperative will simply increase any transaction's cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.750" offset="14922382">What that does, and the record does show this, that the wholesaler-retailer combination here bought in odd lot, small quantity items.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.006" offset="14955401">Now, a cooperative really lives and dies by getting bulk aggregate purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.124" offset="14971910">It relies on its members who traditionally buy through the cooperative, day in and day out, high prices, low prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.778" offset="14998555">What a wholesaler-retailer combination will do is simply take those small items that it happens to run out of, increasing the transaction cost from the cooperative, because they have to engage in more stocking and other kinds of things, and not improve its efficiencies.</text>
