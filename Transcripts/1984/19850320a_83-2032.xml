            <text syncTime="60.455" offset="371800">In addition, Congress has granted the Attorney General discretion to suspend the deportation of a deportable alien who meets certain threshold criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.244" offset="406909">In this case, Respondents have sought to reopen their deportation proceedings in order to seek suspension of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.564" offset="436166">The question in this case is whether in exercising his twin discretion that I have described the Attorney General could take into account the fact that Respondents achieved eligibility, this threshold eligibility, for suspension of deportation only by filing frivolous appeals and engaged in other conduct flouting our immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.180" offset="522684">The Court of Appeals found that the Attorney General abused his discretion by taking these factors into account.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.644" offset="708571">In 1974, with the assistance of a professional smuggler, both Respondents entered the United States without inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.881" offset="737515">In 1978, Mr. Rios-Pineda was discovered by Immigration officials and was granted the privilege of voluntary departure.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.574" offset="792267">Respondents conceded deportability at their deportation hearing and in December 1978 they were ordered deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.395" offset="823510">Because they had been in the country for only four and a half years and the suspension of deportation relief requires seven years continuous presence in the United States, Respondents were not eligible for that relief and their request for that relief was denied at the deportation hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.173" offset="886622">Respondents took an immediate appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, raising several wholly unmeritorious contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.160" offset="914625">And I should perhaps note here that both Respondents' brief to the Board of Immigration Appeals and their later brief to the Eighth Circuit are reprinted in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.783" offset="953077">In accordance with agency regulations, this appeal automatically stayed Respondents' deportation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.853" offset="977423">When the Board dismissed the appeal, Respondents filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals raising essentially the same contentions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2422.296" offset="9819141">A couple points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.946" offset="9821753">I think there's a little bit of confusion here about exactly what's been held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.784" offset="9841084">The Government does not dispute, the Board did not dispute in its remand, that the seven year standard has been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.103" offset="9870341">It doesn't really matter whose fault the delay is, because this is not like a speedy trial case, where parts of the delay are being excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.543" offset="9900120">We agree that they met the seven year standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.226" offset="9906912">What the Board held was that, because the standard was met only because they took these frivolous appeals, thereby bringing these automatic stay provisions into effect, the Board in its discretion was not going to exercise its discretion favorably towards the Respondents to reopen the deportation proceedings that had already been closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.540" offset="9984130">I think it's important to remember that they were found deportable back in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.342" offset="10003356">Nothing that has happened in this case since then has suggested that that determination was in error at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.979" offset="10025926">With hindsight, it is clear that they should have been deported in December of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.632" offset="10044525">The Respondents have already gotten... even at the time that the Board ruled, they had gotten three and a half years of an additional windfall of being in this country, just because they filed these appeals and invoked the stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.774" offset="10089038">What the Board has said that, in addition to that windfall, we're not also going to let you achieve eligibility for relief that would let you stay in this country permanently just because you filed these appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.415" offset="10139611">If they do that, it's going to create a tremendous incentive for everybody to file whatever kind of papers they can to delay things until they meet the statutory requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.438" offset="10175660">If the Board takes the position that it did take here, then at least a person knows that by taking these sorts of dilatory tactics he's not going to put himself in a position to create new equities that is going to give him relief to which he was not entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.280" offset="10235115">And one more point about the Court of Appeals' statement about the appeals not being frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.434" offset="10255699">I just don't think the Court of Appeals disagreed with what the Board said about the merit of the appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.136" offset="10274507">They said the appeals were not frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.505" offset="10284016">The only reason they gave is that they had enabled the Respondents to get relief, that is, that they enabled them to gum up the works for long enough that the seven years passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.444" offset="10319751">That's not... in our judgment, that is not something that--</text>
