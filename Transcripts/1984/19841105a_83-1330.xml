            <text syncTime="43.991" offset="309968">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="47.351" offset="323343">Respondent in this case was convicted of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.997" offset="345912">The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction on the theory that the guns found in Respondent's car were the fruits of an illegal arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.911" offset="377573">The court's ruling was based on two grounds:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.963" offset="389798">First, the court held that investigatory stops, commonly known as Terry stops, may only be made when the police reasonably suspect that a crime is ongoing at the moment of the investigatory stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.292" offset="439117">Because that was not the case here... Respondent was stopped in connection with a robbery that had been committed two weeks earlier... the court concluded that this could not be a valid investigatory stop case.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.190" offset="486765">The court then treated the case as an arrest case and concluded that the officers who made what we consider the stop, what the court considered an arrest, lacked probable cause for an arrest because the facts they were relying on were a wanted flyer issued by a neighboring police department saying that Respondent was wanted in connection with an armed robbery that had been committed in the neighboring jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.353" offset="583418">In our view, the Court of Appeals' analysis was fundamentally flawed by its initial ruling on the scope of investigatory stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.031" offset="618108">We actually find it somewhat hard to believe that the court meant what it said, because there is no decision of this Court that limits investigatory stops to ongoing crimes, and in fact the Court has repeatedly said, as have most of the other circuits, that a police officer having reasonable suspicion may stop when he suspects that a crime is being committed, is about to be committed, or has been committed in the past.</text>

            <text syncTime="145.825" offset="717269">Ms. Oberly, do you take the position that a Terry stop could be made to investigate a past misdemeanor offense?</text>

            <label>Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly</label>
            <text syncTime="166.820" offset="801279">But it would depend somewhat on the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.672" offset="812668">I don't think, for example, that police departments routinely issue wanted flyers for people who are suspected of having committed misdemeanors.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.276" offset="843075">So that I don't think it would arise in the case of a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.790" offset="861151">But I don't think that there's any... in terms of law enforcement interests, the interest is clearly greater in apprehending suspected felons.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.895" offset="901485">But there is still an interest on the law enforcement side in apprehending anyone suspected of committing a crime, whether it's a misdemeanor or a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.272" offset="938996">And so on one side you have the law enforcement interest in apprehending people suspected of committing crimes, and on the other hand, on the other side of the Terry balance as developed in subsequent cases, you have the intrusion on the individual being stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.053" offset="994167">And so long as the intrusion is sufficiently limited, as it was in this case... this was the most limited intrusion imaginable, the stop in this case... then I think that the law enforcement interest in apprehending people suspected of crimes would not dissipate simply because it was a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.291" offset="1059160">But that is, I would stress, not our case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.694" offset="1072743">This is an armed robbery committed by someone who all police departments believed was armed and dangerous, who had a long criminal record, who was known to the police of both departments, and this was a very serious offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.593" offset="1180368">Could the police departments have a practice of either having the flyers say there was or was not a warrant?</text>

            <text syncTime="319.720" offset="1412858">And at that point I think it still would have been reasonable for the Kentucky police to assume... or to at least wonder whether in that intervening six days the Ohio investigation had further progressed, so that there might either have been a warrant or additional information to supply probable cause for arrest, or some changes--</text>

            <text syncTime="377.660" offset="1644616">At that point another officer, who was in his cruiser, overheard this radio communication between the first officer and the despatcher, and the second officer injected himself into the radio communication and he said: I think there is a warrant on this fellow from Cincinnati.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.080" offset="1714311">Then we switched... the radio communication switches to the despatcher trying to get information out of Cincinnati records about whether there is or is not an outstanding arrest warrant on this Respondent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1657.929" offset="6765661">This case, as it gets further along, tends to get more and more blown out of proportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.302" offset="6787186">The case that we originally dealt with at the district court level and the reason that the state court transcript is before you and was before the district judge was to demonstrate, in response to one of your questions, what did the officer mean by "take off".</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.266" offset="6863045">If you read Officer Eger's testimony on page 40 of the joint appendix, his testimony was at that point in time he said hello to Mr. Hensley, told him he was obstructing traffic, and told him to move along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.146" offset="6922500">And he then got on the radio and made an inquiry as to a flyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.180" offset="6946637">Now, it should be noted that then other officers began their conversations concerning this, and the despatcher said there is no flyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.189" offset="6994703">So you have to again look back at their testimony, and their testimony was that they didn't recall whether it had been two months that they had heard it, two weeks that they had heard it, or the day before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.530" offset="7052067">It becomes even more prevalent when you notice that the despatcher hooked into the watch commander and the watch commander said: There's no warrant, there's no flyer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2082.689" offset="8464665">If you take the step and see what the flyer initiated, the flyer, as it was testified to, was based on an affidavit of an individual that it's bantered back and forth whether she was or was not actually involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.660" offset="8524642">It was our position at the district court, it was our position in the Court of Appeals, it's our position here, that woman was not involved; she was just relating what someone had told her.</text>

            <text syncTime="2115.902" offset="8597576">Now, I think the difficulty is, if you're going to have flyers issued and when the officer says in his own testimony, I did not personally believe I had probable cause to get a warrant, if there's a judge involved then I think it can be made proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.693" offset="8664763">But when the police determine for themselves what is going to be probable cause solely for the purposes of investigation and solely for the purposes of arrest, then you're getting a situation that is tantamount to causing the police to have unbridled power to pick up anyone they so choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.404" offset="8735607">In this particular case, you've got a situation where, if the officer from St. Bernard had taken the information he had to a magistrate or a district judge and requested a warrant and that warrant was issued, then I don't think we would be here because I wouldn't have really any argument to try and second guess what was submitted and what is or is not probable cause to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.279" offset="8831111">But when the district court makes that determination, after the defendant's been arrested, after everything's been complete, he looks back and says, well, I disagree with the officer in St. Bernard, I think there was probable cause, I don't think he can do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2775.614" offset="11236361">But when the officer's intent was to arrest, when they were relying solely upon a flyer which requested an illegal act... and let's take the situation as presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.430" offset="11279725">If in that same set of circumstances the officer observes the weapon, we then have to look, what put that officer in that place, whether it was a warrant issued by a judge or a flyer issued by another department.</text>

            <text syncTime="2905.468" offset="11755780">I don't think that's proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.018" offset="11762049">And when an officer in another department places himself as a judge and requests an illegal act to be performed, the officer who performs it, even though he is doing it solely in totally good conscience, he is not insulated from that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.499" offset="11823907">And therefore what put him in the place, put him on the street, put him at the car of Mr. Hensley is no good and whatever he finds incidental to it is no good.</text>

            <text syncTime="2937.441" offset="11883676">Briefly, Your Honor, the case seems in the last hour to have gotten somewhat confused by a lot of different factual situations, and I would just like to reiterate our two main points, which I don't think depend on all the hypotheticals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.492" offset="11943966">One is Terry stops are not and cannot be limited to ongoing crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.644" offset="11964551">It simply makes no sense to say that criminals are home free once they get away with their crime and they're not immediately detected, and we would strongly urge that that aspect of the Court of Appeals' ruling be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.332" offset="12011258">The second point is that it has long been recognized this Court and the Courts of Appeals that police departments must and are able to cooperate with each other; that it is not necessary that they cross-examine each other about the basis of the first department's knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.522" offset="12072071">And in this case there was no reason that the Covington officers had to know precisely what the St. Bernard officers had to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.888" offset="12109478">Yet that is exactly what the Court of Appeals required in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.460" offset="12119823">They said the stop... the arrest was defective because the Covington officers did not have the personal knowledge that the St. Bernard officers had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.575" offset="12156289">In our view that personal knowledge is not required.</text>
