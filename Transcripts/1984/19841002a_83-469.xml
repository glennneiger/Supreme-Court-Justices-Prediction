            <label>Mr. Michael Mc Connell</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="131911">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Respondent's conviction for mail fraud and false statements was reversed by the Court of Appeals because the prosecutor in his rebuttal argument to the jury expressed his personal opinion that Respondent had committed fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.557" offset="506089">Ordinarily, such a holding would be unremarkable, one that this Court would not be called upon to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.992" offset="531793">However, there are three aspects of the case that do make the holding remarkable; indeed, that make the holding directly contrary to precedents by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.221" offset="572753">First, the error, if it was error, was not noticed by trial court or counsel when it occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.750" offset="602847">It was not preserved for appeal by an objection, and the trial court was not asked to take any curative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.559" offset="630118">Indeed, the first time that Respondent mentioned this alleged error was in his papers before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.495" offset="657808">Second, the issue of the prosecutor's personal opinion on Respondent's guilt was not interjected into the trial by the prosecutor but, rather, by defense counsel who opened the issue during the course of his argument that the prosecution had been unfair and his argument that the prosecutor did not, in fact, believe his own case against the Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.654" offset="774523">And, third, the Court of Appeals reversed the conviction without any inquiry into whether the Respondent's rights to a fair trial were substantially prejudiced by the prosecutor's comments.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="173.525" offset="825932">Is this the case where there was no oral argument in the Court of Appeals?</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="182.240" offset="860832">In one of our cases today, there was no oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.113" offset="872326">It's a decision on the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.784" offset="879013">But no matter, we'll check that.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.502" offset="885909">Mr. McConnell, may I just ask at the outset, is there a Tenth Circuit rule that if either prosecutor or defense counsel thinks that his adversary has gone out of bounds, that the rule requires that he object to give the trial judge an opportunity to correct?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_mc_connell" startTime="213.461" stopTime="271.048">
            <label>Mr. Michael Mc Connell</label>
            <text syncTime="213.461" offset="985697">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.836" offset="987160">That appears not to be the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.320" offset="993116">The rule does appear to be that if the defense counsel goes out of bounds, the prosecutor must object but may not pursue that line of inquiry; but that if the prosecutor goes out of bounds and there's no objection by the defense counsel, apparently the practice in the Tenth Circuit, as in this case, is that that has no bearing or very little bearing upon whether the Court of Appeals will take that issue upon on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.856" offset="1099278">Which we would suggest, incidentally, is exactly the opposite of the correct rule, because the contemporaneous objection requirement is itself a rule of appellate procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.398" offset="1153403">It isn't a rule which is designed to govern trial practice when one side opens a line of argument, whether the other side can pursue that line of argument during the course of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.081" offset="1200215">That isn't what the contemporaneous objection requirement is all about.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.048" offset="1216097">What I'm getting back to, a long, long time, but I recall in my own experience as a trial judge that somebody in summation, whether prosecutor or defense counsel, stepped outside proper limits, his adversary had better get up and object to give me a chance to say to the jury, ignore it, or forget it, or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.068" offset="1320169">Isn't that the sensible rule?</text>

            <text syncTime="299.396" offset="1329469">Your Honor, I do think that that's a sensible rule, and I believe that it may often be the appropriate course for the prosecutor to take, to object rather than to pursue a fair response.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.844" offset="1383281">But let me point out just a few factors that make that--</text>

            <text syncTime="322.746" offset="1422882">The trial court has invested a lot of time in the trial of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.291" offset="1445034">Witnesses have been on the stand, everyone has been put out in terms of spending time and effort on a case, and you reach closing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.068" offset="1484113">Why shouldn't you give the trial judge the first opportunity to tell the jury to disregard some improper argument, whether it's being made by defense counsel or the prosecutor?</text>

            <text syncTime="364.168" offset="1588499">--There are several reasons why it may not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.869" offset="1603336">And the most important is that there is a tendency, a tradition if you will, of giving very wide latitude to defense counsel in the course of a closing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.991" offset="1643774">One of the main reasons for this is that when defense counsel is pursuing a line of argument, the prosecutor can't always tell where it may lead.</text>

            <text syncTime="845.742" offset="3514873">Mr. Chief Justice, before lunch, you asked whether this was a case in which oral argument was dispensed with before the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.225" offset="3548727">It was, in fact, and so states in the first paragraph of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.628" offset="3566386">I wanted to return to the issue that we were discussing before lunch and the question specifically whether the doctrine of invited response is not one that encourages the prosecutor to fail to make an objection when he ought to.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.899" offset="3659487">I would like to point out that we are not arguing the equivalent of two wrongs make a right here in this case but, rather, that when examining the prosecutor's comments to see whether they constituted error at all, they have to be examined in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.003" offset="3727823">And in the context of the defense provocations the prosecutor's comments were not error, they did not prejudice the accused, they did not have any detrimental effect on the right to a fair trial in that particular context.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.604" offset="3790308">Ordinarily, there are two dangers involved when the prosecutor expresses his personal opinion on a matter at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.928" offset="3835552">The first is that the jury may conclude from the prosecutor's opinion that there is evidence outside of the record that's known to the prosecutor, but which was not presented to the jury, which would support a finding of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.251" offset="3900858">Thus, the jury may be tempted to convict not on the basis of the evidence, but rather on the supposition of this extra record evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.200" offset="3932623">It would suggest that in this context, after the defense provocation, that there was no danger of that whatsoever, just as Long v. United States, the prosecutor did not say or insinuate that his comments were based on personal knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.208" offset="4000646">Indeed, the comments of the prosecutor were repeatedly interlaced with comments on the evidence, and his comments were truly opinions on the evidence and not opinions based upon anything outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.517" offset="4053935">For example, after reviewing what the various Apco officials had said to Respondent and Respondent had said to them, the prosecutor stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="990.357" offset="4093328">"I don't know what you call that. "</text>
            <text syncTime="991.917" offset="4099493">"I call it fraud. "</text>
            <text syncTime="993.619" offset="4106285">"You can look at the evidence and you can remember the testimony. "</text>
            <text syncTime="996.712" offset="4118719">"You remember what they said and what he admitted they said. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.414" offset="4137527">"I think it's a fraud. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.022" offset="4143901">Note the way the prosecutor continually refers the jury back to the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.333" offset="4165217">Admittedly, the prosecutor is expressing his opinion because the defense had raised the issue of the prosecutor's opinion, but in this instance, the response did not infringe upon the right of the accused to have the jury decide the question on the basis of the evidence before it, because the prosecutor's remarks in this context did not imply or suggest or insinuate the existence of extra-record evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.960" offset="4295725">The second danger from prosecutors expressing their personal opinions on matters is that, as the representative of the government, they may over-awe the jury with the power or prestige of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.345" offset="4353194">Thus, it may tempt the jury to convict not on the basis of the evidence before it, but rather out of a respect for the position of the government in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.685" offset="4390602">This danger is also remote in the context that we're talking about, that is to say, in a fair response context where the defense has challenged the integrity of the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.460" offset="4437727">The prosecutor in this case did not invoke the power and prestige of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.443" offset="4461655">He did not make any of the types of arguments that one sometimes sees quoted, particularly in older decisions in which the jury was being exhorted to follow the lead of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.827" offset="4531140">Indeed, the prosecutor specifically labeled the opinion that he gave as his personal impressions, since it was asked of me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.651" offset="4566458">Thus, the jury was informed by the prosecutor that he was just giving his personal opinion because it was asked of him by the defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.194" offset="4604597">And indeed, there is something a little peculiar about the thought that the jury in this case might have been over-awed by the power and prestige of the government because, after all, it was the defense that had introduced this notion that the prosecution had been behaving unfairly and that it had been reprehensible, and that the prosecution did not even believe its own case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.435" offset="4705638">When the prosecutor responded by saying,</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.980" offset="4719744">"Yes, we do believe in our own case. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.917" offset="4731552">that did nothing more than cancel out the defense counsel's remarks, thus refocusing the jury's attention where it belonged, namely, on the evidence, instead of upon the baseless accusations by defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.675" offset="4798530">Thus, in this case, just as in Long v. United States, where the court... and the court's words there:</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.591" offset="4858193">"Defense counsel's own comments clearly invited the reply which he now attacks. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.230" offset="4880763">Now, again, the question for the Court today is whether this type of response constitutes reversible error, whether there was prejudice to the defendant, and whether the defendant was denied a fair trial as a result of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.235" offset="4968848">It is certainly relevant to that analysis of the prosecutor's comments that defense counsel himself had introduced this line of argument, that he had opened the door to the discussion of the prosecutor's views.</text>

            <text syncTime="1365.064" offset="5592130">When the Court is considering whether an error is plain, there are two determinations that should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.748" offset="5618879">The first is that the error was plain in the sense of its being obvious or clear, and the fact that the Court has spoken to that precise issue on other occasions would certainly contribute to that portion of the finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.962" offset="5679692">But there's a second determination that needs to be made as well, which is that the error, as well as being obvious, was an error of substantial prejudice to the accused.</text>

            <text syncTime="1420.556" offset="5814066">And in any event, it is not plain in the sense of prejudicing the substantial rights of the accused.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.816" offset="6675167">The trial court that had seen the prosecutor's argument could have ruled either yes, this was, in context, a fair response given the gestures and the context and the tone and the emphasis; or no, it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.823" offset="6739114">But in the absence of an objection, there was no such ruling, and thus the appellate court was denied the benefit of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.430" offset="6769625">Just to summarize... and I see that my time is growing short... it is our position that the prosecutor's comments in this case were not error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.626" offset="6850396">And that is because once the defense had opened the door to the line of argument concerning the prosecutor's integrity in bringing the prosecution, the prosecutor was within his rights in making a moderate, perfectly direct, not disproportionate response to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.151" offset="6928450">We do not believe that in anyway that that interfered with the respondent's right to a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.288" offset="6953005">But, in addition to that, the failure of respondent to lodge an objection required a still more exacting review of the nature of the error and the nature of the prejudice which the court did not engage in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.250" offset="7016848">And then, finally, since the court failed to consider the issue of prejudice, at least as a matter of their burden to ensure that they're not reversing on the basis of harmless error, they should have done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.371" offset="7065331">Having not done so they reversed, we contend, needlessly on the basis of an error that was, in fact, invited by the defense and not noticed by defense at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.506" offset="7109844">We believe that this is a serious and needless drain upon the resources available within the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.424" offset="7153521">If there are no further questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Burck Bailey</label>
            <text syncTime="1765.529" offset="7193958">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, Bill Young's defense was that he had no fraudulent intent whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.244" offset="7232829">The evidence showed that he had worked for Apco Oil Company for, oh, several years and his best friends were the people he was dealing with on this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.850" offset="7271281">Apco's refinery at Cyril, Oklahoma, a small town in southern Oklahoma, was chronically in need of product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.018" offset="7303882">It was land-locked and had difficulty getting product down there, and the evidence showed it could not very efficiently meet its fixed costs without a lot of product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.795" offset="7347036">So the president or the vice president of Apco in charge of that end of their business, a man named Hugh Bradley, asked Billy Young if he could get any product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.854" offset="7391235">Billy had been called by a fellow named Ross many times, saying that he had fuel oil he could certify as crude oil under the then-existing tier procedures under the regulations of the Department of Energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.472" offset="7449749">And Bill Young then bought condensate, which is very rich in hydrocarbons... it's gathered at the wellhead... and paid more for it than he could charge, for that matter, and blended the condensate with fuel oil, and his testimony was he was putting the barrel back together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.919" offset="7523519">There were two things that strongly, we felt, supported the proposition that he was acting without any fraudulent intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.837" offset="7559255">First, for the six or seven months that Compton was selling this product to Apco Oil Company at Cyril, they had no difficulty with their output of the refinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.502" offset="7609828">They still got the same gasoline, the same products they always had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.470" offset="7625710">It was only after another company, totally related to any of the parties or procedures in this case, started selling to Apco pure burner fuel, a residue product that has no other products in it, that the Apco Oil Company noticed a change in their output and tested it, and found that there was fuel oil going in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.413" offset="7729469">Also, the government witnesses who knew Mr. Young testified that he was an honorable and honest person, a person of integrity and, in their opinion, had no intent to defraud Apco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.577" offset="7802193">In fact, Hugh Bradley, the very person that he contracted with, the Apco vice president, so testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.168" offset="7836571">So it was in that situation that we reached closing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.071" offset="7856110">The government used the blending as an indication of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.944" offset="7883591">That was the view the government took of it; that yes, that increased the gravity of the oil; that was designed to cover up the fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.500" offset="7941896">Young's version was, no, that's just quite the reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.952" offset="7955689">It was designed to give Apco the equivalent of what they were getting elsewhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="1973.664" offset="8026533">When counsel was confronted, when counsel for the government was confronted with this state of affairs... this was immediately after Mr. Young had testified that he was putting the barrel back together, he had no intent to defraud anybody... that, we submit, the prosecutor felt he needed something outside the evidence to carry the day, and started in the closing part of his... excuse me... the opening part of his closing argument, to talk about the victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.071" offset="8164146">That word had never been used in this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.805" offset="8171042">No one had ever used the word "victim".</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.133" offset="8180342">But the prosecutor says, "They say there's no victim".</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.288" offset="8197060">There's never been any such statement made in the whole transcript.</text>
