            <text syncTime="12.158" offset="179669">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on the State of Nebraska's petition for certiorari to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.663" offset="213732">Nebraska contends that the lower court erred in mandating an exception solely on religious grounds to Nebraska's requirement that a photograph appear on the respondent's driver's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.369" offset="256469">The lower court found two compelling interests in ready and instantaneous identification of licensed drivers as well as the security of financial transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.493" offset="297011">It nevertheless held that the photograph requirement as applied to Mrs. Quaring was not the least restrictive alternative to accomplish the state's objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.866" offset="338493">We submit that the lower court erred in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.235" offset="351972">First, we submit that it failed to apply a qualitative and comparative analysis to the interests of the state and Mrs. Quaring.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.956" offset="386872">Secondly, we contend that it incorrectly applied the least restrictive alternative test, in that the lower court's conclusion rests on the faulty premise that a few exceptions do not undermine the state's legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.916" offset="442670">In short, we are asking the Court to clarify the holdings in Thomas versus Review Board and in Sherbert versus Verner to provide a qualitative analysis of the degree of abridgement of religious freedom in terms of its actual interference with an essential practice of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.664" offset="521664">We feel this is significant for the reason that the lower court specifically found that there was no coercion of action which is contrary to a free exercise claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.221" offset="567953">The first question in any free exercise analysis is, is there a burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.689" offset="589791">Our focus is how much of a burden exists upon Mrs. Quaring.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.510" offset="609017">In that analysis, we must look to the degree of infringement or, if you will, the centrality of her belief and the degree which the state's regulation infringes upon that central core belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.122" offset="679548">We have also evaluated it in terms of the right to drive.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.109" offset="699505">As set forth in our brief, we have indicated that we do not feel that Mrs. Quaring's interest in the right to a driver's license is on the same level as those interests presented in Thomas versus Review Board and in Sherbert.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.118" offset="759483">In essence, the interest or the benefits at issue in those cases were unemployment compensation benefits to which the individuals were otherwise entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.093" offset="807443">We feel that the right to a driver's license is a highly regulated state activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.414" offset="832730">It is subject always to the police power of the state, subject always to reasonable regulations which relate to its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.936" offset="870764">In other words, we may suspend or revoke for repeated infractions.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.273" offset="892080">We may impose restrictions in terms of financial responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.327" offset="912351">It is subject to a whole host of state regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="515.532" offset="2193187">Professor Turner indicated that indeed it was a very difficult task to determine what is religious.</text>

            <text syncTime="608.125" offset="2563499">And in that respect I think one of the potential dangers which we can articulate as a state is that Nebraska has just raised the legal drinking age from 19 to 21.</text>

            <text syncTime="1559.360" offset="6368495">Mrs. Quaring at that time was driving on a license that was issued under the prior statute, which did not require a photograph, and she continued to do that, as the evidence at trial indicated, for a period of four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.369" offset="6424501">This woman then, because of her religious belief, was placed in a situation where she drove her farm vehicles and her automobile on what essentially was an expired license, with the completed examination certificate indicating that she had passed the examination stapled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.049" offset="6507257">I mention that simply--</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.435" offset="6628779">And that is, she had passed the examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.770" offset="6642154">She had qualified under all of the substantive requirements in order to obtain a renewed driver's license at that time, but she was not able to get a renewed driver's license because her religious beliefs prevented her from submitting to being photographed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.132" offset="6707564">Mrs. Quaring and her husband operate a large farming operation in central Nebraska, where they live under what might truly be called the wide open spaces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.606" offset="6753435">The ability to drive a motor vehicle in those circumstances is essential to her ability to continue to work as both a farmer and in her part-time employment as a bookkeeper in a small town that is located approximately ten miles from where she and her husband farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.533" offset="6821145">She operates both the automobiles and various vehicles in the farming operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.389" offset="6856567">She needs to be able to drive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.591" offset="6869419">I think that as far as whether or not this is a question of whether she is just simply trying to impose some kind of thorn in the side of the state, I don't think that is an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.450" offset="6920828">She is not a woman who has ever before found herself in a court of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.652" offset="6941621">The evidence indicates that this is the first time that she has ever been confronted with a legal problem, not only in general, but specifically with regard to whether or not she presents any danger to the state's interest with regard to licensing motor vehicle operators.</text>

            <text syncTime="1775.516" offset="7233043">And I think that as far as the questions with regard to whether or not spurious claims might be made so that people can somehow have fraudulent identifications, I doubt that people would want an identification to go out and write bad checks, if that is the states' concern, that did not have a photograph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.264" offset="7312038">My suspicion would be that the fraudulent licenses that exist have pictures on them of the people who are carrying them, but the other information has been somehow counterfeited, and it is not the photograph that is the subject of counterfeiting in this kind of situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2549.483" offset="10328972">To suggest that you have to somehow evaluate whether or not the burden is big or small or heavy or light I think is really begging the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.327" offset="10380381">The analysis that this Court has traditionally followed throughout its decisions in free exercise cases is that you determine whether there is a burden upon the exercise of the religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2864.901" offset="11590581">I think that my reaction to the facts in the Lee case was similar to what I in fact remember you writing, Your Honor, which is that it was difficult to see how this was going to impact in any negative way upon the social security system, but I think that the Court had another consideration in mind in that opinion, which was that if you begin to make exceptions to any kind of national tax system in a nation such as ours where tax systems operate on a primarily voluntary payment system, that you are leading into a very troubled area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.813" offset="11758288">I think that was a consideration that led the Court in that case on the facts of that case to come to the result they came to in that opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2956.128" offset="11955564">For purposes of clarification of the record, to the extent that this Court deems it important that the legislature has carved out exemptions, there is reference made to exceptions for limited permits with restricted or minimal ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.720" offset="12005928">That is not correct, and it is not supported in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.422" offset="12020766">And at Page 91 of the record you will find that limited or restricted permits are not particularly well defined in the record, but those operator's licenses do have photographs on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.794" offset="12066219">So that is one exception that is incorrectly characterized in the record below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.848" offset="12086385">In closing, we would stress that the least restrictive alternative test ought be examined in terms of the overall objective sought to be accomplished, and if one looks at this in a means-end analysis, the end result is identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.761" offset="12166111">The means is a photograph.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.880" offset="12174575">It is conceded that the photograph is the only identifier which will achieve that goal as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.050" offset="12207280">In examining whether or not we make an exemption, we have to be very careful about looking at just one or two exemptions, and look at the future impact of granting, Number One, exemptions on demand, and other kinds of exemptions, such as numbers or signatures or photographs on security documents or security cards for--</text>

            <text syncTime="3049.053" offset="12327234">Supposing we somehow knew, which of course we don't, that there are no other religious claims going to be made other than the claim to be exempt from the photographic problem, and we could figure out some way to say those cases are all different, maybe because there are a lot more people or something?</text>
