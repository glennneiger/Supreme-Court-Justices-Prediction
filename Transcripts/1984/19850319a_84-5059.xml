            <text syncTime="291.062" offset="1297299">After trial on June 6, 1930... 1982, the petitioner was in fact paroled into the custody of the State of Indiana and was incarcerated by the State of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.861" offset="1356441">On the second... I'm sorry... on February 19th, 1984, Michigan in fact discharged the petitioner from his sentence to incarceration in the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.431" offset="1422792">He therefore continued his incarceration in the State of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.557" offset="1443272">He is due for release on April 24th of the current year, but will be subject to probation for one additional year.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.869" offset="1472529">I am indebted to my colleagues from the state for helping me obtain that information, and I thought I had a duty to the Court to mention that to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.514" offset="1503040">Again, our basic position is that for all purposes other than the charges mentioned in the detainer, the prisoner remains subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state; that therefore, in this case the trial court in Indiana was without authority to try the petitioner on the Diazepam charges and, as a result, its judgment of conviction is void.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.041" offset="1609201">Now, the facts of the case are difficult to get a grasp on because they cover a long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.491" offset="1654968">And I suggest to the Court it would be helpful if the following factors were kept in mind as I go through them.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.752" offset="1680045">First of all, Indiana has incrementally recognized the correctness of the straightforward approach I have just suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.720" offset="1719856">Indeed, the basic error in this proceeding, now admitted by Indiana, could have very easily been corrected at an earlier stage in these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.318" offset="1766250">We are only here today because despite its confession of error, the State of Indiana refuses to give up the product of its earlier overreaction: the void conviction of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.556" offset="1823196">We submit that this reluctance of the State of Indiana is indeed contrary to their own best interests as signatories to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.594" offset="1871366">Now, we have set forth the operative facts in summary fashion on pages 2 and 3 of our brief and in more plenary fashion at pages 3 through 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.531" offset="1911177">The facts involve what we in Indiana call two criminal causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.905" offset="1932597">The first cause, Section 424, involves three charges of dealing with a controlled substance called Diazepam.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.751" offset="1968019">The second cause, Cause 470, deals with delivery of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.427" offset="1998739">Now, the underlying events with respect to the first of those causes, the Diazepam cause... that's the cause we contend he should not have been tried upon... took place over a three-month period in early 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.467" offset="2058925">And the petitioner was arraigned on those charges in April of 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.260" offset="2086093">Now, as we've noted in some detail in our brief at page 4, he initially pleaded guilty... not guilty to those charges, and then later attempted to plead guilty pursuant to a plea agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.718" offset="2131859">But the trial judge refused to accept the plea agreement, because he considered the plea to be improvident.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.691" offset="2155787">The trial was set eventually for March 1980 but later continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.043" offset="2177208">Before trial was had on that first Diazepam cause, the one which is in question here, the petitioner was arraigned in May of 1980 on the second cause, the marijuana cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.552" offset="2227258">The underlying events with respect to that cause took place in December 1979, almost 12 months after the underlying events for the first cause, and therefore, there is no question that they were not in any way related crimes, and no one has contended that.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.854" offset="2296431">In November 1980, after he had been arraigned on both causes but not tried on either, the petitioner was incarcerated by the State of Michigan pursuant to an unrelated felony charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.514" offset="2359125">In March 1981, after he had been in Michigan incarceration for several months, the prosecutor from Howard County, Indiana mailed to the warden of the prison in Jackson, Michigan a detainer which indicated that he wished to bring the petitioner to trial on two counts of dealing in marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.311" offset="2454315">Now, if I may anticipate a question at this point, it ought to be noted that one of the follow-up documents which was sent to Michigan to obtain temporary custody of the petitioner several months after the actual detainer was filed erroneously listed the cause number for the Diazepam counts, and said the petitioner was wanted on three counts of dealing in marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.611" offset="2575418">Now, at trial the State of Indiana contended that this in fact was an independent detainer with respect to the Diazepam counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.688" offset="2611781">The court of appeals of Indiana in its opinion... and you'll note this at the Joint Appendix page 168... said that no reasonable factfinder could reach that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.175" offset="2653681">And I note that the State of Indiana has in fact dropped that contention at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.539" offset="2675206">So in short, having been told that he was going to return to Indiana to stand trial on two counts of delivery of marijuana, the petitioner waived his rights under Article 4 of the IAD, came across the border and... in the custody of Indiana authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.381" offset="2754514">He came across on July 21st, 1981 from Jackson prison in Indiana over to Howard County, city of Kokomo in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.922" offset="2816685">That's northcentral Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.604" offset="2827448">On July 23rd he did file with the court a suggested plea bargain with respect to the Diazepam cause on the ground, but later withdrew it, and he filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that he had been brought across the border unwittingly with respect to the Diazepam charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="973.129" offset="4025528">That's standard practice, for instance, under the Uniform Act to secure the attendance of witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="988.851" offset="4088431">He has a chance to return to the state from whence he came, and you extradite him again.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.863" offset="4108493">It's wasted judicial energy, but it's wasted judicial energy because of the error of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.929" offset="4128764">Indeed, in this case, as I indicated earlier, the state... we were in a position at trial to remedy this in a very easy sort of way, and indeed, if our position here is upheld, this will be remedied very easily in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.227" offset="4193965">In reading through the entire motion to dismiss you will notice that both counsel for the accused at trial and counsel for the state at trial both suggested an alternate remedy to the trial judge at trial; that in fact he could have severed the two causes at trial, proceeded with the marijuana cause, and permitted both the petitioner and the State of Michigan to exercise their rights under the IAD.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.428" offset="4314756">It would have amounted to at most a 31-day lapse of time, and they could have tried the man on this second charge again.</text>

            <text syncTime="1423.617" offset="5827454">We make no claim that there was purposeful deception by the State of Indiana ab initio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.753" offset="5856085">We feel that Indiana is more at fault here for having perpetuated the problem at trial by taking what we suggest was an unreasonable position during the motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.091" offset="5913345">Indeed, if the trial... if the state had acknowledged in the trial court what it now acknowledges, that there was a violation of the IAD, we wouldn't be faced with the delicate task of talking about a remedy for this particular accused today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.626" offset="5999549">The trial judge could have severed these causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.148" offset="6009580">He could have proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.399" offset="6014596">He could have tried the marijuana cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.691" offset="6023791">He could have tried the Diazepam cause about a month later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.484" offset="6038942">There would not have been a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.783" offset="6044166">Section 5(b) and Section 5(g), we submit, when they are read together clearly indicate what the result ought to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.380" offset="6082514">This prisoner in effect was on loan from the State of Michigan, on loan for a very temporary and specific purpose, and the jurisdiction of the State of Indiana was limited by the terms of that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.240" offset="6141969">In fact, we know... it's our reading of the state's brief that they really do not dispute that reading of the statute; thus, in effect, narrowing even further the difference between us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.666" offset="6183660">The state's concern at this point seems to be in maintaining this particular conviction, and we submit that's an understandable but rather shortsighted goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.465" offset="6226919">The State of Indiana, like every other state in the Union, has an overwhelming interest in seeing that the Interstate Agreement on Detainers is in fact observed according to its expressed terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.691" offset="6279791">Indiana joined this compact for the same reason the other 47 states did: to accommodate the daily interreaction of state governments in this very important area of the interstate rendition of prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.690" offset="6335797">As this Court pointed out in its past cases in this area, the IAD protects not only the criminally accused; it also protects the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.728" offset="6375921">It protects our interstate federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.620" offset="6387520">Whatever the long-term vitality of the Ker-Frisbie rule might be in other contexts... and in a footnote in our brief we suggested that it's not entirely compatible with some of the later holdings of this Court... you don't need to reach that question today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.550" offset="6455229">It's clear that here in this area the states intended to adopt a far more cooperative approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.717" offset="6487934">The states don't need the kind of flexibility which Indiana has suggested.</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.230" offset="6801926">He has not... if a remedy is a retrial in this case, I'm not certain that he can be returned to Michigan involuntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.646" offset="6831601">Michigan has no longer a claim on him, and he is a resident, a long-time resident of Howard County, Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.009" offset="6857097">He apparently just want to Michigan for a drug deal, was caught and convicted there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.112" offset="6873502">The petition in this case contends that we have somehow... that the court of appeals in Indiana somehow decided that his interpretation of the second document is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.129" offset="6929508">I don't read that in the opinion of the court of appeals of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.961" offset="6940898">The court of appeals did hold that there was a violation of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.157" offset="6965662">I don't find in there a holding that the second document sent to Michigan is not a detainer within the meaning of the interstate agreement on detainers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.791" offset="7000143">And we contend that it is a detainer within that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.995" offset="7016966">The agreement does not define detainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.507" offset="7031072">A detainer is simply any document which puts the holding state on notice that the prisoner is wanted in another state for trial on a criminal charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.683" offset="7067748">The second document sent to Michigan, entitled 4-24, fulfills that test for a detainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.989" offset="7104947">Therefore, we maintain there was a detainer sent to Michigan on 4-24; therefore, Article 4(d), relied upon entirely by the petitioner, does not apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.878" offset="7148519">The Kansas Supreme Court in a case entitled State v. Clark, and referred to in our brief, addressed that very issue and held that a request for temporary custody in the absence of some other document is a detainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.747" offset="7212049">We have a detainer in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.379" offset="7218527">Unfortunately, the detainer, the request for temporary custody, used the word 4 controlled substance&gt; ["].</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.574" offset="7251337">But it did refer to the proper cause number, the proper counts; it did inform the holding institution that Indiana wanted this gentleman back for trial in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.162" offset="7289685">The consequence for filing that request for temporary custody is that it triggers the speedy trial provisions of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, and that's exactly the purpose for the adoption of the Interstate Agreement, to provide for incarcerated prisoners a method to obtain their speedy trial rights under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.683" offset="7367738">We provided that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.095" offset="7373381">We have given the defendant here the benefit, the intended benefit of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.118" offset="7397518">Had we not tried him after getting custody back under 424, he would then have been entitled to the remedies provided by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.824" offset="7436284">If we had not tried him within 120 days, he was entitled to discharge with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.638" offset="7455614">If we had sent him back to Michigan in order for this procedure that's talked about, the hearing procedure, if we sent him back to Michigan, the no return provision of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers says we cannot try him thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.458" offset="7514860">He is entitled to dismissal with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.799" offset="7524264">So the prosecutor here is faced with a terrible decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.400" offset="7534609">If the request for temporary custody is a detainer, and he sends him back to Michigan, he is forever precluded from trying that defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.897" offset="7572643">In that sort of catch-22 position, I think the prosecutor did the only thing he could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.012" offset="7597094">He proceeded to trial on Cause number 424.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.253" offset="7614021">If we assume for a moment that the defendant is right and that the court of appeals did say that this is not a detainer... I don't find that there, but if they said it's not a detainer on 424, we then must examine Article 5(d) to see if it provides what the petitioner says.</text>

            <text syncTime="1949.985" offset="7932924">If there was a detainer, Article 5(d) doesn't apply, and the Indiana court had clear jurisdiction to try the defendant on Cause number 424 the drug charge with no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.624" offset="7983497">If it's not a detainer, as maintained by the petitioner, then we need to examine Article 5(d) of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.171" offset="8021740">That article has eight paragraphs, those numbered paragraphs or lettered paragraphs (a) through (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.345" offset="8046400">Each deal with a different aspect of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.208" offset="8065835">The petitioner has lifted out the first sentence of 5(d), but 5(d), in order to be understood, must be read as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.611" offset="8095510">The first sentence provides that temporary custody shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the untried charges which form the basis for the detainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.008" offset="8137097">And if it stopped there, the petitioner's position would be much stronger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.090" offset="8149427">But the second sentence of Article 5(d) I think explains the purpose for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.702" offset="8167817">It goes on to say that except for his attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place where his presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.340" offset="8206374">That is the purpose for that first clause, to ensure that the prisoner is held in jail and returned to the sending state after his trial in the receiving state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.458" offset="8246811">And that interpretation coincides exactly with the expressed purposes of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Earl Daily</label>
            <text syncTime="2973.490" offset="12026938">That's correct, and that's why we're here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.421" offset="12034671">This Court has acknowledged that granting new trials is an extreme remedy, and it doesn't always comport with the interest of sound judicial administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.756" offset="12076049">That's a quote from Jackson v. Dence filed in an amicus brief that I apologized for in yesterday's Black v. Romano case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.164" offset="12109694">We are looking here at something that comports with the interest of sound judicial administration, and I think the concerns addressed or expressed from the bench earlier are valid here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.041" offset="12161208">Sound judicial administration does not require a retrial in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.906" offset="12180643">The agreement doesn't require it, and sound judicial administration does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.548" offset="12199242">I don't want to leave without addressing the question of whether or not there is a here an interstate compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.622" offset="12231530">That's one of the most important aspects in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.714" offset="12243859">I want to present here an opportunity to reconsider Cuyler v. Adams.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.779" offset="12264130">In 1978 Mr. Justice Powell wrote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.080" offset="12273325">"At this late date we are reluctant to accept this invitation to circumscribe modes of interstate cooperation that do not enhance state power to the detriment of federal supremacy. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.678" offset="12319719">That was in U.S. Steel v. Multistate Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.219" offset="12329854">They found there, the Court found there no compact, no interstate compact because there was no enhancement of state power to the detriment of federal supremacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.176" offset="12373740">I think had that test been applied in Cuyler v. Adams, there would have been a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.889" offset="12392548">The Cuyler Court, quoting from a law review article by Justice Frankfurter, said... began by noting that the traditional role of the Compact Clause was to give Congress supervisory power over cooperative state action that might otherwise interfere with the full and free exercise of federal authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.133" offset="12481574">I think if you had applied that test to determine whether the Interstate Agreement on Detainers interfered with the full and free exercise of federal authority, you would have come to a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.011" offset="12521071">The test actually adopted by this Court in Cuyler used the language "appropriate for federal legislation".</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.885" offset="12552522">I submit that under the Commerce Clause and the 14th Amendment and certain other provisions of the Constitution, there's very little that's not appropriate in some sense, appropriate for federal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.854" offset="12596408">That's a very broad test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.684" offset="12603722">Appropriate for federal legislation covers a great many things which do not and have not traditionally been considered to be interstate compacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.261" offset="12642070">In this case had this agreement merely been between Indiana and Michigan, it is still, I submit, in the analysis of Cuyler v. Adams appropriate for federal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.599" offset="12695464">The fact that 47 other states have entered into it doesn't change the nature of the agreement or the nature of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.371" offset="12718556">The finding of a broad Compact Clause application in Cuyler v. Adams leads the states into a precarious situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.159" offset="12757636">Any agreement that we enter into with another state, whether we intend it to be so or not, becomes an interstate compact if in some sense it's appropriate for federal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.655" offset="12799641">I don't think that was intended by the Compact Clause, and I would request this Court to reconsider the ruling in Cuyler v. Adams.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.960" offset="12824823">The only response by the petitioner to that is stare decisis, but stare decisis has never and should never prevent this Court from examining a case which appears to me to be clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.979" offset="12876963">Although the petitioner will not admit it, the violation of the statute here worked to his benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.361" offset="12902458">He was tried sooner than he would have been had he been sent back to Michigan, if that could have been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.136" offset="12929521">He then began serving his term here sooner than he would ordinarily have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.489" offset="12943001">He is due for release next month rather than several months or several years in the future, which would have been the case had the agreement not been used as it was intended for the speedy disposition of pending criminal charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.007" offset="12997022">Article 9(1), I refer to again, indicates the agreement is to be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.523" offset="13027115">The constructions proposed by the petitioner do not effectuate the purpose of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.167" offset="13049685">The express terms of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers do not entitle the petitioner to a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.652" offset="13075598">To paraphrase Justice Black one more time, there is nothing in the Interstate Agreement on Detainers that requires a court to permit a guilty person, rightfully convicted, to escape justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.897" offset="13116558">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3254.695" offset="13151771">Very briefly, we believe there's a single theme in Indiana's approach to this case: a lack of acknowledgement of its federal responsibility.</text>
