            <text syncTime="72.346" offset="426985">This is an appeal from a decision of the Rhode Island Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.064" offset="441823">The issue before you today is whether the exclusionary rule should be applied to exclude the admission of evidence at an administrative hearing, in this case a liquor license revocation hearing, which evidence has already been excluded from use at criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.526" offset="511726">The lower court, the Rhode Island Supreme Court, answered this question affirmatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.847" offset="532938">The evidence excluded in this case, stolen property, clothing, was found on the premises of the Attic Lounge, a licensed Tiverton, Rhode Island liquor-serving establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.589" offset="588004">On March 11, 1977, the Tiverton police entered the Attic Lounge pursuant to a search warrant which had been obtained by them after receiving a tip from a neighboring police department that they would find stolen property on the property of the Attic Lounge.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.985" offset="661565">They entered the lounge, they found the stolen property.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.503" offset="671596">However, later that warrant was held defective by a Rhode Island Superior Court judge, and therefore the search warrant was quashed.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.195" offset="930417">Under Rhode Island law, because this was a licensed liquor-serving establishment, there is a particular Rhode Island statute... I believe it is cited in the appendix to my brief... which allows police officers and other municipal officials at any time to enter the premises of a licensed liquor-serving establishment in order to see whether they are carrying out their operations within the parameters of the law, and for other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.262" offset="1038669">This was in fact acknowledged by the Rhode Island Supreme Court in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.898" offset="1053193">In this case, however, in this case the Tiverton police did in fact seek a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.385" offset="1079106">Obviously their chief thought was in order to obtain stolen property, they did go into the premises of the bar, found the stolen property, but the warrant was quashed.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.176" offset="1118290">This, of course, meant that the criminal charges which the State of Rhode Island had initially brought against the manager of the bar and against the bartender, had to be dropped.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.132" offset="1158100">However, the Tiverton Town Council, which functions as a local licensing authority for bars within its jurisdiction, had also started procedures, liquor license revocation procedures, against the owner of the Attic Lounge.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.308" offset="1222884">They had begun these procedures pursuant to a Rhode Island statute, another Rhode Island statute which I believe appears in the appendix to my petition, which allows a municipality to revoke a liquor license where it can be shown that any state law was violated on the premises of that licensed establishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.361" offset="1339077">There was no identity between the council members and the bar principals.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.632" offset="1356109">March 28, 1977, the town council sitting as license commissioners held a hearing, heard testimony from the local police about their obtaining of the warrant, their searching the premises of the bar, finding the stolen clothing, on the basis of that presentation, revoked the license of the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.878" offset="1437088">The bar owners appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.362" offset="1443044">Initially they appealed, as it provided by Rhode Island statutory law, to the Liquor License Administrator, Mr. Pastore, who reversed the town council on other grounds, not exclusionary rule grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.836" offset="1496961">The town then appealed that decision to the Rhode Island Superior Court which, for the first time, raised the issue of whether the exclusionary rule should have been applied to an administrative hearing, and held that in fact the Liquor License Administrator, for the wrong reasons, but nevertheless, was correct in vacating the revoking of the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.737" offset="1596540">The town therefore appealed that decision to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.372" offset="1619109">The Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's holding that evidence of stolen property obtained pursuant to an invalid warrant and suppressed already for criminal purposes, should not have been admissible at a liquor license hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.901" offset="1681176">This did this I believe on three bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.734" offset="1688491">They indicated very clearly in their decision an unwillingness to dilute the deterrent effects of the exclusionary rule on police misconduct by allowing illegally obtained evidence to be admitted at such an administrative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.462" offset="1751498">They also did it by analogizing this administrative hearing, liquor license revocation hearing, to a so-called quasi-criminal hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.699" offset="1784412">They called it quasi-criminal in character and therefore said that just as the exclusionary rule is applied to criminal hearings, so should it be applied to quasi-criminal hearings such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.340" offset="1830910">And they finally found an insufficient societal interest in the control of liquor-serving establishments to justify a different finding from the one that they had made.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.166" offset="1886290">We believe that the Rhode Island Supreme Court should be reversed on each of these grounds: first, on the ground of deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.689" offset="1916383">I believe that this court in Janis has commented on the uncertainty as to whether the exclusionary rule in fact deters police from improper searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.580" offset="1967896">It was suggested I believe in that decision that where there has already been criminal exclusion of suppressed evidence, that that is enough, that that is a sufficient sharp medicine, if you will, strong medicine, enacted against a local police, that that is enough to just... enough exclusion in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.528" offset="2063713">I would argue that exclusion has already occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.664" offset="2080223">The evidence that was obtained by the Tiverton police has already been excluded from a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.920" offset="2109271">Therefore, there has been a sufficient penalty enforced against the Tiverton police to justify the deterrent purposes of that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.311" offset="2154829">Moreover, this exclusion occurred at a criminal hearing which I would argue that criminal hearing, that criminal charge was the Tiverton police's zone of primary interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.153" offset="2218254">I would admit that under the standards that were brought forth by this Court in Janis, that this probably qualifies as an intrasovereign situation on its bare facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.330" offset="2270917">I would, however, argue that despite this being an intrasovereign situation, so to speak, that despite their probable employment status, the chief zone of primary interest for these Tiverton police officers entering the bar on that March evening was a criminal offense and not a licensing offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.046" offset="4333754">Tiverton is a small town.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.665" offset="4344308">You have... several of you have brought up the existence of this particular Rhode Island statute which enables local police officers, where they are interested in learning of licensing offenses, to actually enter the premises of a bar in order to determine whether those licensing offenses have in fact occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.226" offset="4422466">I bring that to your attention to indicate what to me seems to be a very clear indication that for the Tiverton police officers entering the Attic Lounge, license... licensing offenses were not what were on their mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.505" offset="4487668">If they were interested in determining licensing offenses, or if that was further down the line for them, they would in fact have not even bothered to have obtained a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.861" offset="4525075">They would have simply entered the bar, and they could have checked around to see if there were any licensing offenses, and the statute does not provide any limitation to where they may look, so presumably they could have looked over the entire premises, and as the Rhode Island Supreme Court itself admits, if in fact being on the premises pursuant to that statute they had seen property which they knew from other information to have been stolen, they could have acted appropriately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.594" offset="4627997">They didn't do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.328" offset="4630923">They got a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.628" offset="4636148">And I think what this indicates, it indicates two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.630" offset="4648164">It first of all supports my argument which I am once again basing upon this Court's concern in Janis, with primary zone of interest, that this... these police officers' primary zone of interest was felony investigation and not license investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.607" offset="4715978">If it had been license investigation, why would they have bothered to have gone to the trouble of getting the warrant?</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.578" offset="4735935">In fact, they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.828" offset="4740951">I think this very clearly indicates that it was the felony investigation that was chiefly on their minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.867" offset="4773029">It brings up another issue, however, the existence of this statute, as to what deterrent effect there would be if in this case the evidence that was obtained by the unlawful warrant was in fact excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.461" offset="4835410">Where you have a statute such as this, there really is very little deterrence effect at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.265" offset="4854636">All it will really do is discourage Rhode Island police officers henceforth from ever obtaining a warrant where there is any other basis pursuant to which they can go on licensed premises in order to take a look around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.040" offset="4913777">In this case it certainly is not going to encourage police officers to obtain a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.594" offset="4935929">It will have exactly the opposite effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.563" offset="4947841">They will not want to take a chance that the warrant will be quashed, that the evidence will be considered excluded for any purposes, and they will therefore simply enter the bar under the statutory basis and will... and see what they can see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.306" offset="5006877">And presumably, if they see something that indicates a felony violation, they could present it to the Attorney General's office for prosecution of that felony violation, and there would be no constitutional issue because they were appropriately on the premises pursuant to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.630" offset="5060167">So I think if in fact this Court were to determine that the excluded evidence could not be used at the liquor license revocation hearing because of the quashed warrant, this would have, if anything, the opposite of a deterrent effect on police officers because it would discourage them from using the more protective constitutional means of obtaining a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.729" offset="5148566">Instead they would always proceed under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.817" offset="5176882">The Rhode Island Supreme Court also indicated its belief that this liquor license revocation hearing was in fact a quasi criminal hearing, although we attempted to--</text>

            <text syncTime="1297.756" offset="5328602">The Rhode Island Supreme Court called this particular procedure a quasi-criminal proceeding because the object of the proceeding, the liquor license revocation proceeding, was to penalize for a legal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.433" offset="5383354">This Court I believe in Lopez-Mendoza designated a very similar, similar proceeding as a civil proceeding, and I believe there are great analogies between the deportation hearings and the liquor license revocation hearing that is before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.859" offset="5449078">For instance, in this case, the Tiverton Town Council was reviewing admittedly bad past behavior of the bar in order to determine whether it should continue to be entitled to hold a liquor license issued by the town.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.804" offset="5516788">Similarly, in Lopez-Mendoza, this Court was faced with the factual circumstances of whether an alien should be allowed to continue to remain in this country because of how he had happened to enter this country, whether he had come in properly or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.579" offset="5583870">In both of these cases an administrative tribunal was reviewing behavior which could be the subject of separate criminal action, but the review was not in fact criminal in type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.275" offset="5654714">Also, another similarity between what is before you and Lopez-Mendoza, it was the informality of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.297" offset="5682822">The Tiverton Town Council was the tribunal which was hearing evidence, excluded evidence, in order to determine whether there should be a license revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.586" offset="5727962">Certainly some rules of evidence probably pertain, but you are basically dealing with a lay, a lay board making a determination as to revocation or nonrevocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.162" offset="5778221">Another point which should be mentioned is that tribunals such as Tiverton in Rhode Island do not need to be shown that a conviction was obtained for this offense against Rhode Island laws in order for them to revoke a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.493" offset="5859619">In other words, they can be presented with evidence that in fact Rhode Island laws were violated on the premises of a bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.746" offset="5888562">But they don't actually have to be shown evidence that a conviction was obtained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1451.606" offset="5944046">To me this indicates an indication that there is a lesser standard of evidentiary concern in order to determine whether a licensed liquor establishment ought to have their license revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.587" offset="6027952">It is true that a board such as the Town of Tiverton, in making this kind of determination, may in fact penalize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.342" offset="6062956">However, I would argue that an immigration court also penalizes in the deportation hearing if they in fact decide that an alien's behavior justifies their being deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.150" offset="6110185">I do not think that this penal, possible penal aspect of a civil hearing such as before you is something that should be, as it was with the Rhode Island Supreme Court, a center for a decision as to whether the exclusionary rule should be applied to such a tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.343" offset="6178940">In fact, the Rhode Island Supreme Court admits excluded evidence in certain kinds of criminal hearings, as do a number of courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.281" offset="6214675">The Rhode Island Supreme Court in its decision referred to probation revocation hearings and bail revocation hearings as criminal proceedings where, although a penalty might be the ultimate result, that in fact the exclusionary rule would not apply to these subsequent but nevertheless criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.814" offset="6304850">Many civil administrative hearings have penal elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.166" offset="6322300">This type of hearing may in fact be held to have some kind of penal element to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.337" offset="6342989">However, I believe that this Court has made very clear in Janis and in Lopez-Mendoza that the label on a hearing is not nearly as important as the effect of applying the exclusionary rule to that hearing will have on law enforcement practices in the area and on the... and what the social impact will be of such an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.339" offset="6455002">I would pass to what that social impact would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.291" offset="6466809">I believe you have before you in the regulation of the sale of liquor an excellent example of a traditional and appropriate area of great governmental concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.551" offset="6523756">And I think that the statutes that we have discussed in Rhode Island show that there is a clearly public policy for close control of licensed liquor-serving establishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.875" offset="6577150">In fact, a license to serve liquor is a privilege which is granted by a governmental authority in Rhode Island, by a municipal authority, contingent, and is held contingent upon the proper operation of those premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.153" offset="6650189">The public need for that control is clearly shown by the statutes that we have discussed, for instance, the ability to enter upon the premises at any time without a warrant simply to determine appropriate operation, upon the fact that a license may be revoked for any proof of the fact that a state law or other municipal law has been broken on those premises, even if there has been no conviction for the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="1690.560" offset="6899815">There are the cases that the Rhode Island Supreme Court relied on in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.880" offset="6921131">The Finn's case is probably the most well known example in New York, and I believe there are other decisions in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.403" offset="6955194">Those cases particularly deal with the issue of liquor license revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.574" offset="6979854">I think if you look at the larger issue of whether the exclusionary rule ought to be applied to civil hearings in general, you will find a very mixed treatment of this particular issue, and I believe I gave as an example the treatment that the State of California has given to the application of the exclusionary rule to civil hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.422" offset="7071282">One of their best cases was... best known cases was the Emslie case in which they basically at the beginning of the case discussed what for them is a very tight adherence to the exclusionary rule even in some other so-called civil proceedings, and then proceed to not apply it in a proceeding which dealt with disbarment of an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.003" offset="7153620">So while I would admit that there are in fact some very strong cases against me on the limited issue of the application of the exclusionary rule to liquor license revocation proceedings, I think if you take the larger look at civil application of the exclusionary rule to a variety of such hearings, you will find that in fact it seems as though the jurisdictions and also the federal courts are pretty evenly split.</text>

            <text syncTime="2630.648" offset="10660193">Yes, it would, Your Honor, and it would I think for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.616" offset="10672105">Things in the law for the most part remain static, but they do change, and one of the things that has changed with a license, an alcoholic beverage license, at one time it was a naked privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.506" offset="10719648">Rhode Island Supreme Court has now recognized that it has the nature of a property right, and it really have value in the sense that without it someone in that business of a restaurant or lounge is not going to make any money, so that it is seriously a penalty for someone to have a lounge business or restaurant business and not to have accompanying it an alcoholic beverage license in today's world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.337" offset="10810972">As a result, to lose it, to have it revoked is indeed a penalty, and as Justice O'Connor pointed out, the Rhode Island statutes provide that if a revocation occurs under the statute which Tiverton acted under, the licensee is prohibited also from having an alcoholic beverage license in that state for a period of five years time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.702" offset="10904386">I believe that that is penal in nature, taking into account the loss of a valuable item of property and the fact that for five years you are prohibited from being in that particular business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.628" offset="10960079">And I think, the most prominent discussion of what is quasi-criminal was in the recent case of Lopez-Mendoza, where it was acknowledged the case, although purely civil in nature, there was some discussion about what constitutes a quasi-criminal situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.774" offset="11036670">And I believe that this case falls right into that category, and it is analogous to the situation of forfeiture in the Plymouth Sedan case where a property right is forfeited, action of forfeiture is taken against it, a revocation is forfeiture, and it has a quasi-criminal nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.103" offset="11113993">This was also pointed out by the Rhode Island Supreme Court, that they can go against an individual in this kind of case under two different avenues, but they are basically co-extensive is the word I believe they used.</text>

            <text syncTime="2780.943" offset="11261323">Do you think that this Court is now content to just say, well, it's quasi-criminal, so we apply the exclusionary rule automatically without considering any of the factors that would justify the application of such a rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2802.209" offset="11346482">I think there are two questions that need to be asked in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.243" offset="11358603">One is does it apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.377" offset="11367067">And I believe it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.212" offset="11370411">If you have gone so far in Lopez-Mendoza, which is purely civil, as indicated, and applied the rule, then it applies in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.551" offset="11407818">Then you go to the balancing test, and in Lopez-Mendoza, I am in basic agreement with the end result of the balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.991" offset="11445539">I believe, though, that applying the balancing test in this case, we don't come out with the same result as Lopez-Mendoza.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.311" offset="11470825">So I think there are two separate questions: application of the rule itself, and if it does apply, then you enter into the balancing situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3186.438" offset="12883318">I would also like to point out that in deterrence, one of the things that I have experienced in doing the research on this was that deterrence generally is used in a singular sense as against the offending officer, as it were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.400" offset="12947162">On the other hand, when we are looking at the costs, we look at them in a pluralistic view as to the cost to society, and I would like to maintain and submit to the Court that I am in agreement with Mr. Justice Brennan when he stated in Leon that the deterrence should be pluralistic in the sense that what we are seeking in deterrence is institutional compliance, and I think that sometimes in making the weighing, balancing situation, the scales are somewhat thrown out of function when we don't stop to look at the institutional compliance that we are looking for, and we focus rather on the singular activity of an officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.346" offset="13126989">And so that in determining the situation of cost, I don't believe that, as was argued by my opponent, that we can simply look at the sphere of influence of the officer himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.153" offset="13178189">I think we have to look beyond that in a pluralistic sense, and I think that would counteract the pluralistic viewpoint we take when we determine what it will cost to implement the rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.852" offset="13268990">Isn't it in the interest of the state, which under the 21st Amendment is given broad powers for the control of liquor, to facilitate everything possible to keep the industry clean and upright?</text>

            <text syncTime="3311.538" offset="13383720">That is correct, and there is such a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.640" offset="13392184">The only difficulty with that statute, Your Honor, as I read it to you, its focus is basically upon compliance with liquor matters and not with other aspects of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.698" offset="13440353">But we do have that broad statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.035" offset="13473790">Now, I wanted to in my conclusion, Your Honor, make reference to the fact that presently the exclusionary rule is considered a judicially created remedial device, and it is restricted to use where its objections... objectives, rather, are best served.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.721" offset="13588520">And despite this attitude, I think we also have to look at it in the framework of Mr. Justice Black in his concurring opinion in Plymouth Sedan where he also states that we must be mindful on the principle that constitutional provisions for the security of personal property should be also liberally construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.385" offset="13671171">So although we have a situation where I can understand the Court's feeling that we have a remedial situation with the judicially created exclusionary rule, but on the other hand, we must take into account the fact that we do have a Fourth Amendment situation which is fundamental, and much recognition should be given to it as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.435" offset="13771377">And under those circumstances, a weigh... even with the balancing of the costs and benefits, as I have outlined in my brief, I think the objective of deterring Fourth Amendment violations requires the result of the Rhode Island Supreme Court to be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.147" offset="13842221">And I say this and would point out that the Rhode Island Supreme Court also recognized, a Chief Justice Burger pointed out to me, that under the 21st Amendment there is a strong police power permitting very vigorous regulation of liquor matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.923" offset="13905333">That is working, and it has worked despite the fact of the Fourth Amendment and the exclusionary rule, and it has worked because of the framework of decisional law that has resulted from that 21st Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.814" offset="13952876">The Rhode Island Supreme Court noted that because that point was brought up by my adversary now in that case, and they recognized and pointed out, the Rhode Island Supreme Court, that there were other measures and alternatives which adequately served that purpose, and more importantly, the interest in doing that, regulating the liquor control, was not as significant as giving recognition to Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.233" offset="14066561">And I believe that the Rhode Island Supreme Court properly applied the rule, properly entered a weighing and balancing situation as to both cost and benefit, and rendered a proper decision which I request be affirmed.</text>
