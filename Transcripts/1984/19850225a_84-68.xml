            <text syncTime="89.741" offset="492338">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, at issue in this case is whether an Indian tribe may unilaterally, without any approval whatsoever from the Secretary of the Interior, impose taxes on non-Indian oil and gas lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.554" offset="571542">This issue arises in this case in the context of the Navajo Tribe of Indians, which has never adopted any constitution at all, and which in fact has twice rejected invitations by the Congress to adopt constitutions, first in Section 16 of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, and second in Section 6 of the Navajo Hopi Rehabilitation Act of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.574" offset="695676">In June of 1982, the United States District Court for the District of Arizona held that the taxes, business activity tax and the possessory interest tax were invalid because they lacked Secretarial approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.100" offset="753772">That decision was reversed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in April of 1984, which held that Secretarial approval was not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.724" offset="796299">The case appears here today on a writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.895" offset="820959">The facts in this case are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.664" offset="832035">The petitioner conducts oil and gas operations on Navajo lands situated in the state of Arizona, lands that were set aside by the Treaty of 1868.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.387" offset="878951">These operations are conducted pursuant to leases issued by the tribe and approved by the Secretary of the Interior or, more precisely, by his delegate, pursuant to Sections 396A and 396E of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1938, Title 25, United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.385" offset="962856">From 1967 to 1979, the petitioner has paid over $7,500,000 in royalties in connection with these operations, and over $111,300 in rentals.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.561" offset="1023565">From 1979 to 1984, the petitioner has paid over $6,100,000 in royalties, and over $104,800 in rentals.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.452" offset="1067137">These payments are not made to the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.735" offset="1076332">They are not made to tribal officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.754" offset="1084378">They are made, rather, to officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, who handled these funds in trust for the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.741" offset="1112276">There is no question that the rate of royalty in these leases is fair and equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.462" offset="1131189">It is set at 16 and two-thirds percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.264" offset="1142369">It is a one-sixth rate of royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.382" offset="1150938">The two taxes at issue here, the possessory interest tax and the business activity tax, were enacted in January of 1978 and in April of 1978 by the Navajo Tribal Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.291" offset="1210497">The resolutions implementing these taxes explicitly state that the taxes are to be effective, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="277.481" offset="1243307">"after approval by the Navajo Tribal Council. "</text>
            <text syncTime="280.433" offset="1255114">The taxes were not approved by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.235" offset="1278311">The taxes purport to enable the Navajo Tax Commission to impose a number of penalties for non-compliance, including the penalty to attach and seize assets of the petitioner on the reservation, including the penalty to suspend or to prominently revoke all rights of the petitioner to engage in productive activity on the reservation, notwithstanding the right that was so granted to the petitioner in the leases themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.087" offset="1389697">The complaint was filed by the petitioner in this case to challenge the validity of these taxes in May of 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.843" offset="1424701">It was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico because petitioner also has operations on Navajo land situated on the New Mexico side of the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.651" offset="1471930">These are uranium mining operations, and are far larger in scope than the oil and gas operations which are situated on Navajo lands in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.007" offset="1505367">The Federal District Judge in New Mexico dismissed petitioner's claims against the tribe and the Tax Commission themselves on the grounds of sovereign immunity, but the remaining claims proceeded against tribal officials on the doctrine of ex parte Young on the allegations that tribal officials were purporting to exceed their lawful authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.289" offset="1598572">In March of 1980, the District Judge in New Mexico transferred that portion of petitioner's challenge to these taxes which dealt with its operations in Arizona to the United States District Court for the District of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.982" offset="1661266">The District Court in New Mexico stayed all further proceedings in New Mexico pending resolution of issues that at that time were pending before the Tenth Circuit, and which subsequently were pending before the United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.308" offset="1718631">I am referring to the Merrion decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.843" offset="1728766">The case in New Mexico has still been stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.462" offset="1743186">It is still presently under a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.414" offset="1751023">In Arizona, all proceedings were stayed until this Court had rendered its decision in the Merrion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.901" offset="1776936">When the Court rendered its decision in Merrion, District Judge William Koppel entertained motions for summary judgment that had been filed by all of the litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.126" offset="1821867">He granted summary judgment in favor of petitioner, holding the taxes to be void and invalid because they lacked Secretarial approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.712" offset="1856244">He based his decision on the collateral estoppel effect of a similar decision that had been rendered in similar litigation in the District of Utah, and in addition he held in any event after Merrion the tribe was required to obtain Secretarial approval before these taxes could become effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.109" offset="1933775">Now, the Ninth Circuit reversed that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.895" offset="1944956">The Ninth Circuit held, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="457.030" offset="1961465">"Secretarial approval is required only of those tribes that have chosen to include such a requirement in their constitution bylaws or charters. "</text>
            <text syncTime="470.622" offset="2015904">The Ninth Circuit did not refer to this Court's decision in Merrion in reaching that conclusion, and the Ninth Circuit did not state any basis for that rationale.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.725" offset="3252227">This, of course, is the understanding that the Bureau of Indian Affairs had at the very outset, from adoption of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934.</text>

            <text syncTime="917.280" offset="3802471">But he also explained, however, that in light of the Indian Reorganization Act, amendment of the tribe's constitution to authorize the tax, to announce the intention to tax, was the necessary event or the critical event, as I believe he put it, necessary to effectuate the tax, and the word "effectuate" was highlighted.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.081" offset="3905707">In short, again we are talking about existence of a power and the manner and extent by which the Congress has regulated that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.437" offset="3939143">At the present time, it is essential that there be this administrative process for review of the tribal taxing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.309" offset="3978640">As the Court mentioned in Merrion, Secretarial approval is a necessary constraint to minimize the potential concern that tribes may exercise the power to tax in an unfair or unprincipled manner, or in any way inconsistent with overriding national interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.754" offset="4044365">Under this Court's interpretation of Santa Clara Pueblo versus Martinez, we cannot challenge the unfairness of this tax under the due process or equal protection clauses of the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, nor can we challenge the due process and equal protection problems we have with these taxes under the Federal Constitution, since it has been held that those limitations do not apply to Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.088" offset="4157736">In short, the only relief that we have is if this administrative process established by Congress to monitor such exercises of tribal authority is upheld and respected by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.265" offset="4210399">That in fact is exactly what the Secretary did in connection with the Hopi Indian Tribe, which of course resides on the land situated within the exterior boundaries of the Navajo Tribe.</text>

            <text syncTime="1074.216" offset="4430245">In Merrion, this Court, referring to the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, and the adoption of tribal constitutions to announce tribal intentions to tax as well as Secretarial approval of the specific taxing ordinances, held, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.296" offset="4510598">"Here the Congress has affirmatively acted by providing a series of checkpoints that must be clear before a tribal tax can take effect. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.604" offset="4555738">This was a point as to which the Court in Merrion was unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.775" offset="4580502">Justice Stevens in his dissent explained that to the extent that the power to tax was an attribute of sovereignty possessed by Indian tribes when the reorganization was passed, Congress intended the statute to preserve those powers for all Indian tribes that adopted a formal organization under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.040" offset="4669527">The serious problem with the construction that the Ninth Circuit gave to the Indian Reorganization Act is that it imputed to the Congress and to the executive officials of this nation, including John Collier himself, an intention to deceive the Indian tribes of this country by going around the country and telling them, this Act is for your benefit, this is an Act which is going to strengthen your tribal powers, this is an Act which is going to free you more and more from federal control.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alvin H. Shrago</label>
            <text syncTime="1201.065" offset="4937648">Nevertheless, if that conclusion is reached, then the majority of Indian tribes in this nation that adopted constitutions under the IRA have been frankly tricked by the Congress, by President Roosevelt, by Commissioner Collier, by the federal government for 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.396" offset="5011000">And in fact as the Tenth Circuit recognized in the Southland Royalties Company case which is presently pending on a petition for rehearing, if this interpretation is upheld of the Indian Reorganization Act, it will encourage tribes which have adopted constitutions to repudiate their constitutions so that they may exercise these powers without federal supervision and federal control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.646" offset="5127924">This would be the remarkable conclusion that the objectives of an Act of Congress can best be furthered by ignoring and repudiating the Act altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.168" offset="5174004">It simply makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.037" offset="5181527">The need for Secretarial approval, of course, is unquestioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.624" offset="5207858">As the Court observed in Merrion itself, Secretarial approval is one of those constraints that minimizes potential concern that the tribal taxing power may be exercised in an unfair or unprincipled manner, or that it may be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with overriding national interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.056" offset="5301586">The Secretary under the present state of the law is the only one who can oversee the propriety of these tribal exercises of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.281" offset="5346516">Under the Martinez decision, the violation of the Indian Civil Rights Act by implementation of tribal power in a civil context as opposed to the criminal context simply cannot be reviewed by a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.056" offset="5409628">Indeed, as the Secretary has recently invalidated or refused to approve the severance tax enacted by the Hopi Tribe on the grounds that it violated the due process clause of the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, we see no reason, no basis, no principle either in logic or in fact by which the Secretary could claim that the identical tax which offends the identical due process clause of the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 should somehow be permitted to be implemented merely because the other tribe has not adopted a constitution under the IRA or under similar legislation, and in fact has not adopted a constitution at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.223" offset="5606278">To the contrary, we believe that the need for Secretarial review, federal oversight of tribal exercises of the taxing power is all the more pressing in the case of those tribes which have refused to adopt constitutions than it is in the case of those tribes which have at least followed the Congressional policy and adopted constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.456" offset="5707215">After all, the constitutional form of government in this nation is basic, principal, and fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.460" offset="5739189">In New Mexico versus Mescalero Apache Tribe, a unanimous decision of this Court involving hunting and fishing rights and regulation of those rights by the state or by the tribe, this Court observed that federal law commits to the Secretary and to the tribe the responsibility to manage the reservation's resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.714" offset="5852247">The Court also unanimously held that federal law requires the Secretary to approve the tribe's hunting and fishing ordinances, which of course the Secretary had done in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.056" offset="5909612">This, of course, was also a matter on which the Court had remarked in United States versus Wheeler, a case involving the Navajo tribe itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.233" offset="5966245">In Wheeler, the Court distinguished between the existence of an inherent power, and that was the basis on which there was a dispute between the majority and the minority in Merrion, whether as a matter of inherent tribal power, the power existing, not on whether the manner and extent of that power had been regulated by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.812" offset="6056629">The Court in Wheeler, a case involving the Navajo Tribe, explained that Congress has in certain ways regulated the manner and extent of the tribal power of self-government does not mean that Congress is the source of that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.256" offset="6114412">We have the difference between existence of the power and the manner in which that power can be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.178" offset="6146072">The Congress intended that for tribes to exercise the power to tax against non-Indians, at the very least that tax must be approved by the Secretary or, in the words of the Merrion Court, receive specific general approval before it could become valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.393" offset="6242934">This result, of course, is consistent with the legislative history underlying enactment of the Indian Reorganization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.553" offset="6299568">John Collier explained that the bill provided the machinery for progressive establishment of home rule by tribes or groups of Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.695" offset="6344185">The Senate report, which was presided over by Senator Wheeler, the sponsor of the bill, the Wheeler-Howard Act, in the Senate, explained that the legislation was intended, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.518" offset="6395385">"to stabilize the tribal organization of Indian tribes by vesting them with real though limited authority and by prescribing conditions which must be met by such tribal organizations. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.428" offset="6455049">Under the interpretation of the Indian Reorganization Act advocated by the Ninth Circuit, those tribes which rejected the Indian Reorganization Act would be vested with not limited power but with unlimited power, and that interpretation would encourage the majority of tribes in this country who have adopted constitutions in pursuance of the objectives of the Indian Reorganization Act to disband those constitutions, to repudiate them, to revoke them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1632.647" offset="6663924">Apparently the notion is that tribal or Secretarial review is a matter that is required by tribal law and not by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.418" offset="6707078">That is the premise of that argument, which I submit is wrong and inconsistent with this Court's holding in Merrion that IRA and adoption of a tribal constitution and Secretarial approval fulfill the administrative process established by Congress to monitor such exercises of tribal authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1701.041" offset="6937478">In conclusion, the Ninth circuit decision rejects Merrion's interpretation and holding with respect to the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.967" offset="7001217">The Ninth Circuit's decision interprets the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 as an Act of Congressional deceit to trick Indians into contracting away, as the United States has explained it, their powers in the face of representations that the IRA would strength their government and free them from federal control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.499" offset="7091392">The interpretations will encourage the majority of tribes who have adopted constitutions to repudiate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.820" offset="7116678">The result is that there will be unlimited exercise of absolute governmental power, ironically on lands owned in fee by the United States government itself.</text>

            <label>Ms. Elizabeth Bernstein</label>
            <text syncTime="1779.457" offset="7251156">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Navajo Tribal Council enacted the broad-based tax laws at issue in this case because it is badly in need of funds to provide essential governmental services, including police, fire protection, roads, health care, clean drinking water, to a reservation of over 25,000 square miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.422" offset="7351049">These laws, like other tribal laws, were submitted in due course to the Department of the Interior, and it was the decision not of the tribe but of the Department of the Interior that there was nothing in federal law, federal regulations, or tribal law which conditioned the effectiveness of those tribal taxes on Secretarial approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.819" offset="7436626">The Secretarial has therefore repeatedly and in writing declined to act either approve or disapprove the laws as he asserts that it would be a gratuitous act of no effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.210" offset="7482183">Two and a half years after the possessory interest tax was enacted by the Navajo Tribal Council, Kerr-McGee amended its complaint to allege that the validity of the taxes depended on Secretarial action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.803" offset="7536623">It is important to realize the scope of Kerr-McGee's allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.890" offset="7568910">There is no question in this case but that Congress, for example, has power to control, divest, limit tribal taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.829" offset="7604645">But Kerr-McGee is alleging not just that Congress has delegated to the Secretary, for example, the power to regulate tribal taxation, not just that the Secretary in the absence of regulation even could veto a tribal ordinance, but rather, that in the absence of affirmative federal action which the Secretary has declined to take and determined to be unnecessary, a tribe's exercise of its own inherent sovereign powers, powers which this Court has recognized to derive not from the federal government but from the tribe's sovereignty, that the tribe may not exercise those powers, that the exercise remains ineffective, that the Secretary cannot even waive, either deliberately or through lapse of time, such a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.910" offset="7793040">One of the ironies of this case is that that was not even the case under the Jicarilla Apache constitution, which, although it does subject certain taxing laws to Secretarial approval, also provides that if the Secretary fails to disapprove a law submitted within 120 days, the law will become effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.771" offset="7864407">Other tribal constitution under the Indian Reorganization Act specifically allow the Secretary in his sole discretion in writing to waive an approval requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.746" offset="7908397">The need for that kind of certainty and that kind of closure is a great in tribal government as it is anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.835" offset="7936714">Kerr-McGee's argument would throw tribal government into chaos.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.621" offset="7951865">It leads to the conclusion that there may be scores of tribal laws which have been on the books for decades now which everyone has believed to be effective but which according to Kerr-McGee would be ineffective because there was an approval requirement that was so subtle and so implicit that the Secretary didn't know that it existed, and that the Secretary's own determination that there was no such requirement has never sufficed to give effect to those laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.454" offset="8063147">Over 100 years ago the Senate Judiciary Committee upheld the validity of Chickasaw revenue ordinances which fell on non-Indians and which had been approved by no agent of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.281" offset="8122497">In the Attorney General opinion cited in the United States' brief in 18 Opinions of the Attorney General, it was... that earlier Senate Judiciary Committee determination was not reaffirmed, but the Attorney General went on to answer specifically the question, not only were these laws valid, but were they subject to revision or control by any department or officer of the United States, and concluded that they were not because Congress had not delegated that power to any agent or officer of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.006" offset="8269409">The argument about tribes having been tricked into reorganizing under the Indian Reorganization Act rests on a fundamentally incorrect assumption, which is that if the tribe organized under the Indian Reorganization Act, it was required to condition its laws in that constitution on Secretarial approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.271" offset="8362405">That has never been the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.571" offset="8367630">It has never been the Secretary's interpretation of the law, nor did Congress say anything of the sort in the Indian Reorganization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.948" offset="8425204">In fact, while the Act referred to Secretarial approval with respect to certain additional powers which were enumerated in the Indian Reorganization Act, with respect to the vesting of existing tribal powers in the tribes pursuant to their constitutions, there was no mention by Congress whatsoever of Secretarial approval.</text>

            <text syncTime="2093.961" offset="8509214">What is the explanation or the speculation as to why the tribes, some tribes or perhaps all of them who adopted constitutions put in this requirement of Secretarial approval?</text>

            <text syncTime="2110.073" offset="8573684">The United States cites examples of constitutions going all the way back to 1937 which did not contain such requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.743" offset="8604299">I believe, though, that the explanation is that the Indian Reorganization Act was enacted because there were many, although not all, tribes which had essentially lost their tribal governments entirely during the allotment era.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.819" offset="8660619">And those tribes had very little experiences at that point, anyway, in operating a government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.823" offset="8688623">Those tribes were specifically in need of additional guidance by the Secretary, and as well the approach of the Secretary and the Bureau of Indian Affairs to tribal government at that point was one of exerting a great deal of power over Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.422" offset="8775036">It may be that the Secretary carried that further than Congress wanted it to even in the Indian Reorganization Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="2993.809" offset="12108574">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, petitioners have, in my view and perhaps in the Court's view, never really explained what their argument is, whether it is that the power of Indian tribes to tax which survived dependent status was conditioned, hobbled, limited for the first time in 1934 or 1938, depending upon whether they are relying on the Indian Reorganization Act or the Indian Mineral Leasing Act, or whether their argument is that long before that and independent of those Acts of Congress the power of Indian tribes to tax non-Indians doing business on a reservation was always subject to Secretarial or federal approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.110" offset="12321837">It is not surprising that they do not choose between these two alternatives, because either one leads to a dead end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.484" offset="12363320">The first, the one seemingly most emphasized, that is, reliance on the Indian Reorganization Act and the Indian Leasing Act of 1938, obviously founders on the main objective of those two statutes, which were to increase, not decrease, Indian self-government, to maximize, not to hobble the power of Indian tribes to earn their own revenues through taxation and other means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.687" offset="12488080">Furthermore, they have difficulties under the text of both of those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.741" offset="12508352">As we know, the Indian Reorganization Act, first of all, is optional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.109" offset="12521831">It requires no tribe to agree or not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.478" offset="12535310">It requires no tribe that does come under the Act to adopt a constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.751" offset="12560387">It requires no such constitution to provide that taxing ordinances in particular or any others shall be subject to Secretarial approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.607" offset="12603751">Accordingly, the IRA is simply not a proper source for insisting that Congress imposed Secretarial approval as a precondition to the validity of any taxing ordinance effecting non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.734" offset="12668325">Under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1938, similar problems arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.722" offset="12692254">That Act, to be sure, does give the Secretary pervasive regulation of leasing, the management of Indian property, and area traditionally governed, controlled, supervised pervasively by the government, but the Act has nothing whatever to do with the exercise not of the landlord's right but of the governmental prerogatives of an Indian tribe, including the power of taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3182.399" offset="12862990">Justice O'Connor, in the particular case of provisions in IRA constitutions, it seems to me that the source is the IRA itself insofar as Congress said the constitution adopted pursuant to this Act shall be valid only when approved by the Secretary, and impliedly Congress presumably permitted the Secretary or the tribe or the two together to include within such constitutions further approval requirements with respect to certain kinds of legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3221.690" offset="13020143">Is it presently the Secretary's view that tribes with a written constitution under the IRA can amend their constitution and the Secretary will approve it if the amendment is to withdraw Secretarial approval to impose taxes?</text>

            <text syncTime="3238.069" offset="13085658">Exactly so, Justice O'Connor, and as counsel for petitioners correctly stated, our brief recites that it has been the policy of the Department of Interior for some years now not merely to approve amendments to constitutions to remove what as a matter of federal law are unnecessary Secretarial review provisions, but to encourage amendment of tribal constitutions to that end, and a substantial number of tribal constitutions have recently been amended with that in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.309" offset="13226614">Why don't we turn to the alternative argument that seems to be made in part by the petitioners?</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.165" offset="13258066">That is that from time immemorial, at least since the tribes became subject to the jurisdictions of the United States, their power of taxation has been somehow subjected to federal approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.507" offset="13319401">That is tantamount to saying that the power of taxation did not survive, and it amounts to nothing more than the privilege of asking the Secretary, if you agree, may we tax, and only if he says yes may they do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.517" offset="13375408">So that is hardly a sovereign inherent power that survived dependent status in the sense in which this Court indicated that power both in the Coville and in the Merrion cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.408" offset="13422951">It is, moreover, completely at odds with the historic distinction between the supervision of the United States over the property management function and attributes of Indian sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.285" offset="13494526">In order to protect tribal land, in order to protect the Indians from being taken advantage of by outsiders, by their neighbors, by those who were selling them goods, the government has traditionally since the first Nonintercourse Act in 1790 and in a series of treaties and legislation ever since quite pervasively regulated property transactions so as to protect the Indians from being taken advantage of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.769" offset="13600479">There is nothing, nothing at all comparable on the side of the exercise of Indian sovereign prerogatives, including the taxing power.</text>

            <text syncTime="3509.878" offset="14172874">It is charged that we have on the one hand said that it is a good idea to subject tribal taxation to federal approval and today take a difference stance.</text>
