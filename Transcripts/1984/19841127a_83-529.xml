            <text syncTime="52.355" offset="346925">The case began when there was an operation to investigate suspected smuggling, marijuana smuggling in the... it was believed to be occurring either in the northernmost coastal county of South Carolina or the southernmost coastal county of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.958" offset="421321">And the main actor on the law enforcement side was DEA Agent Cooke, who was patrolling the highways near the beaches where the marijuana activity was suspected to be occurring, and he saw the pickup truck with camper shell, which turned out to be driven by respondent Savage, proceeding in tandem with a Pontiac automobile, which turned out to be driven by respondent Sharpe.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.977" offset="541380">Being suspicious of these vehicles, he followed them for some 20 miles as they proceeded south and observed certain things about them which to his mind confirmed his suspicion that they might be engaged in marijuana smuggling.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.579" offset="603760">He determined at that point that he might like to make a stop, and he radioed for assistance, and Patrolman Thrasher of the South Carolina State Police joined this procession of vehicles as it proceeded toward Myrtle Beach, and shortly after Thrasher joined the procession, the pickup truck and the car made a turn onto a camp road, sped along that road well in excess of the speed limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.536" offset="719640">The road made a loop and returned to the main highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.410" offset="727163">They were followed all this time by Agent Cooke and Patrolman Thrasher.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.190" offset="750255">They turned back on the main highway headed south.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.642" offset="764048">At that point it was decided by Agent Cooke that they should be stopped for investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.749" offset="788498">He asked Thrasher to signal them to halt.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.856" offset="804903">Thrasher did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.466" offset="811382">When he did so, the Pontiac automobile driven by Sharpe pulled over to the side.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.463" offset="835310">The truck driven by respondent Savage sped off in between the patrolman's car and the Pontiac down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.677" offset="880136">At this point, Patrolman Thrasher followed the truck down the road and Agent Cooke stopped with the Pontiac.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.392" offset="919006">He asked Sharpe for identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.998" offset="937501">Sharpe produced a license in the name of Raymond J. Pavlovich.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.529" offset="951607">Cooke made some further efforts to communicate with Thrasher which were initially unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.932" offset="985253">At the same time, he called for backup units from the Myrtle Beach Police to come and hold Sharpe and his passenger while he went on to see if he could locate the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.522" offset="1027571">He went down the road, caught up half a mile down the road with Patrolman Thrasher and the truck, and in the meanwhile, to come back to that stopping, Thrasher had pursued the truck, stopped it half a mile down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.685" offset="1104267">Savage had been ordered out of the vehicle or had been coming out of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.402" offset="1127045">It is not quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.449" offset="1131225">He was frisked.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.461" offset="1159333">He produced a bill of sale in the name also of Raymond J. Pavlovich, and at that point he was simply held by Agent Thrasher... by Officer Thrasher until Agent Cooke appeared on the scene.</text>

            <text syncTime="1420.713" offset="5820309">The Court should consider such factors as the gravity of the offense under investigation, the risk that the suspect would avoid apprehension if he is released, the substantiality of the officer's suspicion, the degree of inconvenience caused to the suspect by the detention, and the intrusion of circumstances beyond the officer's control, and this is quite relevant to this case, that caused the prolongation of the detention, and, of course, considerations relating to the officer's personal safety.</text>

            <text syncTime="1476.800" offset="6044649">You did join the decision of the Court in United States against Cortez, where there was... the issue was whether there was reasonable suspicion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1487.734" offset="6088430">The car was pulled over, and within a matter of a couple of minutes, there was consent to a search, which produced the illegal aliens who were hidden in the back of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.416" offset="6135137">Now, in this case, if you look at what happened from the time Officer Cooke arrived at the pickup until he acquired probable cause, there was a question and answer period, a request for consent to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.176" offset="6190203">All of this took somewhere around five minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.175" offset="6198144">Savage had claimed that the vehicle was empty, and that he was on the way to get the shock absorbers fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.876" offset="6232939">Cooke then conducted what we might call a non-search inspection of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.905" offset="6253106">He stepped on the bumper to see whether it was empty, as had been suggested, or fully loaded, as he thought he had observed in pursuing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.776" offset="6284557">And he put his nose up to the vehicle, took a strong breath, and smelled marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.914" offset="6309112">Now, all of this would be, I think, within the confines of what you would agree would be a permissible Terry stop, a very concise, directed inquiry of short duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.503" offset="6359476">The only reason in this case that that didn't happen right away is because of the conduct of the suspects in one of them separating himself from the other and proceeding down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.872" offset="6412975">Now, it seems to me that at least in those circumstances the government ought to be permitted to conduct that narrow investigation, and the delay here of ten or fifteen minutes in Agent Cooke getting to the scene so that he could conduct that brief investigation should not be counted in the balance against the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.926" offset="6497194">This should be held to be within the scope of a permissible stop even under the view that only the narrowest kind of intrusion is justified.</text>

            <text syncTime="1905.800" offset="7760685">I was trial counsel, so if I slip, please forgive me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.047" offset="7773641">There are certain facts which Mr. Frey has mentioned which I think need some clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.951" offset="7797256">One is that at the time of the actual stop of the Sharpe vehicle, that was done by Cooke.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.869" offset="7836962">That is on Page 17 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.571" offset="7847725">He waved Sharpe over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.820" offset="7860786">Then, over the radio, Thrasher said to Cooke, I'll take the camper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.770" offset="7888580">He then moves forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.941" offset="7897253">There is no evidence in the record that he sped forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.205" offset="7914285">The record is that the camper and the state trooper vehicle almost hit accidentally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.656" offset="7944064">That is what the record actually says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.264" offset="7950543">And he put on his blue light, and apparently about a half a mile down the road, which isn't very far, they both succeeded in pulling over to the... on the south side of the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.776" offset="7992547">Now, you have both vehicles stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.260" offset="8002474">Cooke gets out of the car, and he goes over to Sharpe, and he says, give me your license, and Sharpe gives him a license that says Pavlovich on it, but at that time Cooke doesn't know who the man is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.350" offset="8042911">So he thinks he is Pavlovich.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.692" offset="8056286">He then immediately calls for Myrtle Beach Police backup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.142" offset="8078020">They arrive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.407" offset="8087111">In the meantime, there is no colloquy between Sharpe and Cooke.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.390" offset="8107068">He doesn't ask him a single question in the stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.217" offset="8118353">He doesn't say, what are you doing?</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.575" offset="8123787">Are you in tandem with the camper?</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.638" offset="8132041">Is there dope in the camper?</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.933" offset="8141236">What are you doing out here at 6:30 in the morning?</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.885" offset="8148969">Even more than that, Cooke follows them for 20 miles to this point from the beach area in North Carolina, and during the entire time Cooke doesn't attempt to raise any DEA people on the radio, even though there is an entire DEA task force operating in the area, to answer Justice Blackmun's question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.594" offset="8251891">Now, what we have is that the vehicles arrive in Myrtle Beach on the outskirts and Cooke says, uh-oh, I am going to lose them in town.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.635" offset="8308002">I've got to do something now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.978" offset="8313436">I am really not sure what is happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.775" offset="8320541">He pulls them over, asks no questions, calls the Myrtle Beach backup, they get them and put them in the back of a police car, marked police car, two armed officers, and they sit there for 40 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.347" offset="8370905">He takes Sharpe's license, puts it in his pocket, puts the other passenger of the car, who was never prosecuted, in the back of the police car, leaves them both there under armed guard, never having asked a question, goes up the road and sees Savage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.856" offset="8432867">In the meantime, Savage has asked Thrasher twice to leave, right in the record, admitted by Thrasher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.244" offset="8458467">He says, what do you want me for?</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.322" offset="8466722">Here is my driver's license, here is my bill of sale, which by the way happened to be in the name of Pavlovich.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.788" offset="8488665">He says, and I want to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.632" offset="8495979">Thrasher says, you can't go, I'm holding you for Cooke.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.490" offset="8511444">However, if I really want to get you, I can hold you for that speeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.332" offset="8526804">Clearly, the record factually suggests that speeding was a pretext.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.627" offset="8548015">At any event, Cooke comes up and Savage says, I want to leave, give me my license back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.716" offset="8584378">In the meantime, Thrasher has put Savage's license in his pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.340" offset="8598797">Cooke says, you can't leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.948" offset="8613217">Then, and only then, Cooke looks at the registration and sees the name Pavlovich, and the bells go off, because he now connects the two vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.631" offset="8663999">Until that point, there wasn't even a connection that they were traveling in some kind of a concerted action except for the fact that they were just driving one behind the other, and because they had gone through the campground together.</text>

            <text syncTime="2220.594" offset="9019891">No marijuana, mind you, but burlap bags which look like marijuana that he has seen in other cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3414.397" offset="13795075">Is it really so unreasonable to do what the officers did in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.677" offset="13816182">Does the Constitution of the United States say that these rather modest measures can't be taken for the purpose of a very important societal interest such as the detention of this kind of crime?</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.828" offset="13864769">I just find it difficult to believe, and I just wanted to say to Justice Brennan that the not free to leave point, if he were free to leave, there would not be a seizure regulated by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.086" offset="13921821">This case is about the difference, where the line is between a seizure that is permissible on reasonable suspicion and a seizure that requires probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.959" offset="13961318">Both of those are similarly characterized by the suspect not being free to leave, and therefore the fact that he says I would like to leave and the officers say no seems to me quite immaterial to the issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3466.907" offset="14005099">Couldn't you argue that the officer could say, well, if you want to leave, go ahead, but I am keeping your truck?</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.045" offset="14033625">That is what they do in the airport cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3482.432" offset="14067166">Well, that would be true, although I think the principle of Michigan against Summers is that if you are going to find out very shortly whether you have a basis for arresting the individual or you hope to, then you are not obliged to let him go off into the twilight.</text>
