            <text syncTime="658.066" offset="2764332">The most important finding with regard to that incident was that the assault in question happened under color of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="668.181" offset="2804770">He used his police identification to get one of the petitioners out of the car, and then assaulted one petitioner with a knife, and as the petitioners fled used his service revolver to attempt to kill them.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.299" offset="2845312">The District Court, as I also noted, found a number of specific policies which had been engaged in by the police department, and concluded, I think correctly, that--</text>

            <text syncTime="822.713" offset="3422932">I think your description of the policy is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.484" offset="3434008">It was not the policy of the city to encourage assaults on teenagers parked in shady lanes in the middle of the night, but it was the policy of the department to take no action and indeed to make no effort to remove from the force officials whom were well known to be dangerous officers, people who have a propensity for violence, who were regarded in this case as so dangerous by their colleagues in the department that other police officers would not ride in the same squad car with the patrolman who committed this offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.678" offset="3570785">This is a case in which there was virtually a complete breakdown in control.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.041" offset="3596280">I mean, people were given guns and badges and set loose on the citizenry.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.333" offset="3609446">There was simply no control over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.795" offset="3615297">If they turned out to be dangerous, violent human beings who went around beating people up or shooting at them, the police department in Memphis had a policy of doing nothing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.030" offset="3652182">And we think that such a policy certainly is sufficient under Monell.</text>

            <text syncTime="933.084" offset="3864401">Reviewing the trial transcript, and indeed the briefs on appeal, looking at that very issue, my reading of what happened is that no one really questioned that there was a constitutional violation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.674" offset="3918736">You had two individuals accused of no crime whatsoever who were assaulted by a police officer acting under color of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.560" offset="3954367">There doesn't seem to have been a point in the litigation where the defendants denied, and I think no defendant reasonably could, that that violated the Constitution in a number of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.957" offset="3991879">The issue as all parties perceived it below was whether or not liability for that extended beyond the particular patrolman who wielded the knife and pulled the trigger.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.851" offset="4031480">And again, like the problem about Monell, that is an issue which was not raised in the District Court, was not raised in the Court of Appeals, probably can't be raised at this late date, and in any event shouldn't be raised in the first instance here without the Court of Appeals having a chance to look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.323" offset="4097413">The District Court judgment, as I indicated, ran against the director in his official capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.218" offset="4136910">The Court of Appeals concluded that that judgment in fact was a judgment against him personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.474" offset="4165959">Based on that premise, it then applied the good faith and immunity rule of Scheuer against Rhodes and Procunier against Navarette, and found that Director Chapman had acted in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.122" offset="4220607">At the point of the District Court opinion, as chance would have it, by operation of Rule 43(c) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Director Chapman was no longer a party to the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.651" offset="4270657">Of course, he had left office prior to the decision of the Court of Appeals, and the nominal defendant at that point was Police Director Holt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.997" offset="4300019">In any event, the narrow issue which we think is before this Court is not an issue of first impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.322" offset="4337322">In our view, it is an issue of fourth impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.355" offset="4345472">The question of whether a judgment against an official in his official capacity runs against the entity or against the individual personally has been resolved three times before.</text>

            <text syncTime="1143.844" offset="4707425">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I perhaps understated the language in Monell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.407" offset="4721740">Monell says that a claim against an individual in his official capacity is generally the same as a claim against the entity of which he is an official.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.991" offset="4756012">Now, the word "generally" I take it was sort of precautionary language the Court customarily and wisely uses, you know, to guard against the possibility that some situation might arise where such a claim wasn't to be treated as identical to a claim against the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.732" offset="4819020">But Rule 25 in our view contemplates that they are to be treated as the same thing, and no case comes to mind which would be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.421" offset="4873772">It is one of the annoying things about the law that cases which don't come to mind sometimes do come to pass, and I don't want to... as the President is prone to say, Presidents never say never, I am a little reluctant to say never myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.169" offset="4924763">But certainly no case that I can imagine exists in which these... in which a judgment against an official in his official capacity would be any different than a judgment against the entity itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.635" offset="4966664">In any event, the specific question at issue here is whether there is any difference between a judgment against an official in his official capacity and a judgment against the entity with regard to the good faith defense recognized by Percunier and Scheuer against Rhodes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.536" offset="5034269">That was the precise issue that was before the Court in Owen against City of Independence, in which the officials... the defendant was not just in that case the City of Independence, but a number of officials who were sued in their official capacity, and the Court in Owen noted that only the liability of the municipality was at issue in Owen, not any liability of the individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.294" offset="5137296">A similar reading of what it means to have a judgment against an official in his official capacity was made by the Court in Huddo against Finney with regard to liability issues and the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.384" offset="5197586">We think that all of these decisions are clearly correctly decided, and one need look no further than the actual language of Rule 25(d), which provides that upon the removal from office of any official in an official capacity action, his or her successor is to be substituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.596" offset="5274491">That rule would make absolutely no sense if an official capacity judgment imposed personal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.740" offset="5299046">That would mean that if we had a judgment against Mr. Chapman in his official capacity for $1 million, he resigned and was replaced by Director Holt, that we could then garnish Director Holt's salary and seize Director Holt's house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.511" offset="5366128">It is simply inconceivable that the framers of Rule 25 contemplated that an official capacity action could produce personal liability of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.947" offset="5403849">On the contrary, the committee note makes it quite clear that official capacity actions are actions which, although brought in form against a named officer, are intrinsically against the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1355.841" offset="5555464">Snyder against Buck and the like were actually damage actions, and it had long been assumed in those cases, in suits against a postmaster or whatever, that the government was going to actually have to pay the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.919" offset="5603738">The problem in those cases was one postmaster would leave office, another postmaster would come in, and there would be procedural chaos.</text>

            <text syncTime="1925.975" offset="7835954">The court comments that the parties in the case expended considerable energy either relying on or distinguishing in their opinion an opinion in the case of Hayes versus Jefferson County, and that was a Sixth Circuit case that applied the applicable standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.367" offset="7905544">The question was whether the standard in Peratt v. Taylor would apply or whether a greater degree of negligence should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.110" offset="7936473">And by the fact that both parties were spending a considerable amount of time addressing themselves to that issue, it was obvious to the Court of Appeals that the only issue that was before them was one... a question of negligence, and not a question of policy under the Monell standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.383" offset="8009616">And as I say, they go ahead to find that in reality, the plaintiffs are attempting to amend their complaint so as to treat the police director as though he were the city in order to provide the qualified immunity which shields Director Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.326" offset="8077430">Nothing was ever referred to, no mention was ever made of any Monell standards in the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2407.350" offset="9761492">Well, the way I get away from it, Your Honor, is because of the standard which should be applied under Monell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.825" offset="9787405">The fact that he was acting in his official capacity, and there are many cases which I am sure Your Honor is fully familiar with where we deal with individuals acting in their official capacity in the operation of whatever it may be, school board, police department, or what have you, and there can be no question that he was acting in that role.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.000" offset="9872042">He wasn't acting as just an individual off the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.501" offset="9886043">Of course not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.383" offset="9889596">He was acting in his official capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.272" offset="9901194">But the standards that have to be applied are entirely different, we contend, with regard to whether or not he would be liable in his individual and liable in his official capacity, and the only way that he could be liable in his official capacity would be under the Monell standards, whereas he is the alter ego of the police department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.140" offset="9992623">The police department obviously can't function without its representatives, and he, of course, stands in that position, and anything that he does, of course, does represent the police department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.776" offset="10047167">But in order to hold the police department liable or the city liable in this circumstance, we would have to, as we say, apply the Monell standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.874" offset="10087604">But I cannot say that he wasn't acting in his... in an official capacity, but I think it is quite common that suits against officials, whether they be individual or in his official capacity, he was certainly acting as school board member, or as an officer of the state, or as a member of the police department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.912" offset="10191676">But the fact that whether he is individually liable or liable in his official capacity really brings into play two different standards, and if you are going to say that liability or at least suing him in his official capacity is just another way of suing the entity itself, we submit that the Monell standards would have to apply, and not the typical negligence standards which apply in cases against individuals who, although are acting in a so-called official capacity, but who would be liable individually rather than as a representative of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.638" offset="10354680">As I mentioned, the court preliminarily came very close to dismissing Director Chapman on a motion for summary judgment, and it was obvious at this point that the Court was only considering Director Chapman in his individual capacity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2636.732" offset="10679017">So, when we say close, if Your Honor please, what we are saying is, the court was giving very careful consideration to whether there was even enough in the case to hold Director Chapman liable based on what he knew or should have known, and did grant leave to file a renewed motion on that one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.734" offset="10766997">But again, what we are saying is, it was clear that the only thing that was being considered was Chapman as an individual, and not in an official capacity, which would be another way of holding the city in.</text>

            <text syncTime="3045.836" offset="12315431">A couple of quick things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.130" offset="12332568">Mr. Justice Rehnquist earlier asked whether under Monell one had to have a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.472" offset="12350017">At 436 US at 690, the list of things that are sufficient under Monell includes a decision, so a discrete act or, I would think, failure to act as well as an ongoing failure would be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.752" offset="12403098">Mr. Klein suggested, though I may have misheard him, that there was no discussion at the trial court level of the Monell standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.009" offset="12440088">At Page 21 of our brief, we refer to a discussion of just those standards, and the need to prove policy under Monell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.555" offset="12474256">However, we think that much of the discussion that we have presented runs a bit far afield of what the Court should appropriately decide at this juncture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.331" offset="12513439">There are two, perhaps two questions that we have been considering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.424" offset="12533815">First, did the District Judge properly find Chapman liable in his official capacity, and second, is such a judgment against an official in his official capacity a judgment which runs against the city rather than against Chapman personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.374" offset="12597554">It is only the second question that was decided by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.156" offset="12612705">Indeed, it was only the second question that was raised in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.669" offset="12626706">The Court of Appeals at three points in the Joint Appendix, Pages 30, 39, and 46, characterizes this as a suit against Director Chapman in his official capacity, and at Page 46 squarely holds that a judgment against an official in his official capacity runs only against him personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.331" offset="12705387">Now, at this juncture, that finding, I think, stands almost undefended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.606" offset="12726494">I think Mr. Klein came close to conceding that it was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.808" offset="12739346">Certainly he has not gone to the point of arguing that it is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.701" offset="12750840">But in any event, that is the only decision that was actually resolved by the Court of Appeals, and we think that is all that need appropriately be considered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.914" offset="12779784">The question of whether the District Court should have imposed liability on Chapman in his official capacity is a much more far-reaching, far-ranging kind of bundle of problems, none of which were addressed below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.764" offset="12835163">In discussing them, we have conducted something of a grand tour of civil procedure jurisprudence, the problems of Monell, of Percunier.</text>
