            <text syncTime="796.910" offset="3323228">That is, that a law enforcement officer in the field has to determine whether or not this vehicle is now placed in a constitutionally protected parking spot.</text>

            <text syncTime="889.602" offset="3694062">One, it requires that you make some differentiation between a vehicle based upon configuration.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.589" offset="3713915">Under the Solicitor General's approach, there are some vehicles which have the capability of an expectation of privacy and some that do not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1130.755" offset="4658607">In particular, of course, Carroll involved an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.623" offset="4670101">But he found it significant not to differentiate between an automobile, and a wagon, and a ship, and a motorboat, yet the ship, the wagon, and the motorboat are clearly capable of serving a residential function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.765" offset="4722660">Yet they were not to be treated any differently than an automobile, because both of those things, all of those conveyances, had the ability to move.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.306" offset="4760798">And it was that ability to move which caused the privacy expectations to yield to the exigency created therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.126" offset="4788070">As I believe it is footnote 8 in the Ross opinion suggests, that if you give probable cause to believe that you're transporting contraband in a vehicle, then you're not entitled to the added protection that a warrant provides if there is probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.486" offset="4849510">And of course the probable cause determination is going to be evaluated by a magistrate at some point in time anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.740" offset="4874588">The question is, are we going to provide the added protection of the magistrate evaluation before the search or after the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.562" offset="4901860">And of course if the probable cause analysis by the officer was faulty, that evidence is going to be lost to the exclusionary rule, and there will not be any... certainly there will be an inconvenience to the party because of the unlawful search, but he will not suffer a criminal ramification as a result of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.790" offset="4978764">The protections are provided under that situation, and we think that that's a good place to draw the line because it is capable of being properly enforced, and it is capable of a bright line approach.</text>

            <text syncTime="1261.556" offset="5181788">That is what the reasonable approach entails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.275" offset="5192759">And I think Chief Justice Taft talked about the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.627" offset="5206134">What he said is, it's a wise one because it leaves the rule one which is easily applied and understood and is uniform.</text>

            <text syncTime="1278.435" offset="5249393">And it's really not the rule that the California courts, or the California Attorney General's office is proposing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.505" offset="5269664">It's the rule that this Court has articulated and rearticulated in Carroll, and Chambers, and Ross.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.392" offset="5293174">And we are asking that it be applied to all vehicles, regardless of their configuration, or regardless of what the people who are driving those vehicles think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.598" offset="5329954">I mean, what they expect personally is really not terribly important, because there is no way to confirm those facts objectively.</text>

            <text syncTime="3020.413" offset="12217295">A house car is a vehicle which has either been designed or permanently altered for human habitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.601" offset="12253971">The importance of the definition that they have adopted in the California Vehicle Code is this: that it is a criminal offense to possess an open container of alcoholic beverage, to consume an alcoholic beverage in a vehicle, except in the living quarters of what the legislature defines as a house car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.598" offset="12337980">This is a criminal law that the California State Police officers are currently required to enforce on an everyday basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3072.797" offset="12426797">The rule that I suggest is that before warrantless entry of a motor home can be accomplished, there must be some showing of a genuine need, more than a theoretical need.</text>

            <text syncTime="3119.694" offset="12614356">The point is this: There is no need for an automobile exception if none of the justifications and none of the reasons for its necessity are present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.400" offset="12657197">If the motor home is traveling down the highway, if it's likely that evidence is going to be lost, if it's going to explode, if the officers need to enter it for their own safety, existing law permits them to do that even if we apply ordinary Holmes rules to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.881" offset="12731175">The interests at stake, the interests in the privacy of a home-like place even if it's on wheels, I think require a higher showing than the relaxed standard which has justified warrantless searches of automobiles in most circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="3173.846" offset="12830963">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.381" offset="12845174">In rebuttal, the State of California would like to advance four positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.369" offset="12865131">First of all, with regard to the specifics in this particular case, counsel has referred to the living compartment in this case as supporting the residential purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.625" offset="12902121">But the record does not at all support this particular assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.611" offset="12922078">And in particular, if one examines the photographs that are a part of the record in this case that were submitted to this Court, looking at the picture of the refrigerator will show that there is marijuana in the refrigerator, but there is no food.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.538" offset="12977771">And when they examined the cupboards in this case, there's no underwear, there's no sheets, there's marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.192" offset="13000341">There's nothing in the record to suggest Mr. Carney was using this as his home, and in fact that is the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.279" offset="13024687">There is no way to determine, in these particular class of vehicles, when they are and are not being utilized as a home, objectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.701" offset="13062408">Secondly, Justice Marshall's concern with the Cadillac stretch car points out the flaw in the reasoning of the Respondent, because it is our impression that more people in this country live in cars and live in pickup trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.044" offset="13119773">The poor people that can't afford motor homes live in those vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.913" offset="13135238">More of them live there than live in motor homes, which are typically more expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.698" offset="13150389">Yet they are to be accorded a different expectation of privacy merely because they can't afford the trappings that a motor home would provide them with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.737" offset="13186542">I think that that's an unfair application of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.506" offset="13197618">Thirdly, the definition that Mr. Homann gives with regard to house cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.343" offset="13221024">The California Supreme Court did not use that term in the Carney opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.330" offset="13240981">They talked about "motor homes".</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.182" offset="13248295">They didn't talk about "house cars".</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.165" offset="13256237">That definition was not promulgated to apply to search and seizure law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.336" offset="13276926">That definition was promulgated in order to register these vehicles and to show that those vehicles would be accorded a certain registration fee, and that in certain circumstances, particularly when there is open alcohol containers, that an individual that has that container in the back is not going to be cited for that particular violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3329.448" offset="13453409">It does have a special license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.365" offset="13457066">But I might add that the Vehicle Code section that the California Supreme Court refers to is not the code section defining "house car".</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.054" offset="13487786">It's a different code section that defines "mobile home".</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.939" offset="13499384">And the house car section is Section 3.84, I believe, of the vehicle code, and 3.62 of the vehicle code is the house car definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.497" offset="13545569">I might also add that the legislature has also determined that, for purposes of burglary, that the burglary of a residence is burglary in the first degree in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.919" offset="13587260">Yet the burglary of a house car or an automobile, it lumps it into the category of second degree burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.423" offset="13613278">They don't provide that with the trappings of a residence in the penal code, even if there may be some provision in the vehicle code determining... with licensing involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.481" offset="13657582">And finally, if police officers are going to be allowed to ensure that a vehicle does not move, if they are going to be able to get the evidence in there, they have to be allowed to seize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.222" offset="13712544">It has to be stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.657" offset="13718186">And once that seizure is made, this Court has determined in the past that there is no difference constitutionally between seizing and holding that vehicle while one awaits for a warrant, and subjecting it to an immediate search at the officer's option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.182" offset="13788299">There is a reason for that difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.965" offset="13795509">Different policy provisions come into play once you seize and hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.450" offset="13813376">Because at that point in time, if one is to require the officers to hold the vehicle while awaiting a warrant, they are going to be subjected to danger; they are going to be subjected to the possibility that--</text>
