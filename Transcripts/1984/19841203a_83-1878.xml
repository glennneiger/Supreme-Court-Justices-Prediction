            <text syncTime="79.921" offset="456499">This case presents an important issue of administrative law that we had thought was well settled prior to the District of Columbia Circuit's decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.605" offset="495265">That issue is whether the courts have authority to review and set aside an administrative agency's discretionary determination not to bring law enforcement proceedings against someone who is alleged to have violated a provision of the agency's statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.374" offset="610308">The FDA apparently believed that its statutory mandate just didn't reach the question of state-sanctioned use of lethal injections for executions, and if that is correct would our inquiry just end there?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="145.878" offset="720336">--Well, before the Court could reach the question of whether that was right or not, it would seem that the Court would first have to answer the question whether this decision of the FDA is reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.297" offset="753982">If it's reviewable, then the Court can decide whether the FDA made an error.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>

            <text syncTime="159.015" offset="772894">Well, do you think that the question of whether something is within the statutory jurisdiction of FDA at all is something that is reviewable?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="170.089" offset="817198">Not when the question arises in the context of a challenge to the failure or the refusal to bring enforcement proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.164" offset="841440">But here the FDA didn't just say that it didn't have statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.006" offset="860875">The letter, which is reprinted in the appendix to the petition beginning on page 81A, went on to say as a second and separate basis of denial, it gave a number of reasons why it would not bring this proceeding even if in fact the language of its statute could be stretched to cover this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.389" offset="930361">Now, in the last several years a number of states have passed statutes prescribing lethal injection with drugs as the method of carrying out the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.354" offset="974246">Respondents are a group of prison inmates who have been sentenced to capital punishment in two of these states, Texas and Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.569" offset="1003085">In 1980 they filed a citizen petition with the FDA contending that the states of Texas and Oklahoma were intending to violate the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, apparently because the FDA had never approved the drugs in question as safe and effective for the purposes of human execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.014" offset="1084901">The Respondents asked the FDA to require warning labels on these drugs stating that they couldn't be used as a means of execution, and also asked that the FDA adopt a policy of seizing the drugs, bringing injunctive proceedings, and even criminal prosecutions of the responsible state prison officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.521" offset="1166925">The FDA declined to take any of these enforcement measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.582" offset="1183121">As I just mentioned in my colloquy with Justice O'Connor, the FDA first concluded that it didn't have jurisdiction to intervene in the states' practice of administering capital punishment, but went on to say that, even if it had jurisdiction, it would decline to exercise it under its inherent discretion not to pursue certain enforcement matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.511" offset="1258876">Respondents then brought suit to challenge the FDA's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.572" offset="1275072">The district court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that the enforcement decisions of an executive agency are simply not amenable to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.632" offset="1307360">But a divided panel of the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.615" offset="1323242">The D.C. Circuit held that the FDA in fact did have jurisdiction to intervene in this area under the misbranding provisions of the food and drug laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.628" offset="1363366">These provisions prohibit the misbranding of drugs while they are "held for sale", and the Court of Appeals' reasoning seems to have been that these drugs are misbranded because they're warning labels don't state that they can be used for purposes of capital punishment and that they are held for sale when they are forceably administered to these prisoners pursuant to a court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.381" offset="1466289">The court then went on to hold that the FDA's decision not to exercise its enforcement discretion is subject to judicial review and that the FDA had acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and without legal authority here.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.908" offset="1516444">Now, what the District of Columbia Circuit's ruling amounts to is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.468" offset="1538700">First, the court devised a highly imaginative and we think quite dubious construction of the food and drug laws, in an effort to conclude that the states' lethal injection procedures violated the misbranding provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.806" offset="1596065">Then the court compounded the problem by holding that the FDA has a mandatory duty, a mandatory duty to initiate investigative and enforcement proceedings, based on this quite dubious legal theory and against the agency's better judgment, simply because a citizen petition had been filed alleging a statutory violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.219" offset="1677672">We think this Court should reject this remarkable restructuring of the proper role of an agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.826" offset="1704107">Now, this case, to be sure, arises in a somewhat unusual factual context, but that factual context should not be allowed to obscure the important administrative law issues of general applicability that were decided by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.303" offset="1770041">This case only fortuitously involves capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.208" offset="1781639">If Respondents prevail here, then it's reasonable to assume anyone whose citizen petition is denied by the FDA can sue and seek review of whether the FDA should have brought enforcement proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.297" offset="1830018">I'm informed, by the way, by the FDA that they are besieged by complaints filed by trade and industry representatives claiming that some competitor is engaging in a misbranding violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.308" offset="1878083">In fact, there was a case in the Eighth Circuit just last year in which some dairy producers sought review of the FDA's refusal to bring enforcement proceedings against people who were selling allegedly misbranded cheese.</text>

            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="449.318" offset="1934089">Well, the Court of Appeals' decision isn't limited to the FDA.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="452.645" stopTime="557.712">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="452.645" offset="1947360">That's another problem, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.364" offset="1954256">Of course it's not limited just to the FDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.191" offset="1961570">The FTC, the NLRB, and the SEC, for example, regularly declined to pursue investigative or enforcement activity based on the complaint of someone who claims to have been injured as a result of that activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.202" offset="2013606">And these decisions too would presumably be subject to judicial scrutiny under the Court of Appeals' approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.306" offset="2038057">This system of judicial oversight of the manner in which executive agencies choose to deploy their enforcement resources would represent a sharp break from the current state of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.850" offset="2084241">This is a suit under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.099" offset="2093227">The Administrative Procedure Act generally makes all final agency action subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.816" offset="2116111">But it has two very important exceptions to that general principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.862" offset="2132307">One exception provides that agency action is not reviewable if the matter is committed to agency discretion by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.686" offset="2167520">And we think that the Court of Appeals got off on entirely the wrong foot in this case when it held that this exception had to be construed very narrowly because all agency action is presumptively reviewable, because any presumption that operates in this area, it's that Congress would never have intended to subject to judicial review the enforcement decisions of an administrative agency without a clear statement to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.457" offset="2270651">And that's because this Court for more than a hundred years has repeatedly held that the decisions of a law enforcement agency whether or not to instigate, institute an investigation or an enforcement proceeding, is committed to the sole discretion of the administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.776" offset="2347869">And the Court reaffirmed this settled principle only a few years ago in the Southern Railway case.</text>

            <text syncTime="592.854" offset="2508261">If someone claims that that was violated, then the question is obviously reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.976" offset="2524666">But there has to be some law to apply, which is what, of course, the Court said in the Southern Railway case.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.303" offset="2550057">Now, the Court of Appeals, Judge Wright, dismissed this hundred year old line of Supreme Court cases as having a so-called anachronistic ring to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.986" offset="2584747">But we don't think that these decisions are anachronistic at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.438" offset="2602615">The reasons for the settled rule against judicial review of agency enforcement decisions are not very difficult to appreciate.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.044" offset="2636992">The decision of whether to bring an enforcement proceeding is not simply a mechanical task whereby the agency decides whether they have probable cause to believe the Act has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.242" offset="2677743">The agency also has to make a number of policy, judgment calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.069" offset="2693103">It could decide, for example, to bring a great number of small proceedings because of the in terrorem effect of doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.472" offset="2722674">On the other hand, it would be equally reasonable to eschew bringing small proceedings, but to bring a number of large enforcement proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.861" offset="2756215">Or it could decide to go against violators of one provision of its statute rather than another, in the view that one portion of the statute is more important.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.591" offset="2787144">It could also decide only to proceed with enforcement when the law is clear and the agency is likely to win.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.527" offset="2814938">But it would be equally reasonable for an agency to decide to bring a number of test cases and see if it could expand the outer perimeter of its authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.835" offset="2844196">All of these are policy and judgment calls.</text>

            <text syncTime="1143.179" offset="4709547">What makes Bachowski so distinguishable is that in that case Congress had provided... and it was quite unusual, but I think understandable in that context... that if the Secretary of Labor had probable cause to believe a violation of the law had occurred, the Secretary had to bring an enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.639" offset="4779347">The statute was written in that peculiar way, I think in part because it wasn't a true exercise in prosecutorial discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.855" offset="4804215">The Secretary, as this Court said in Bachowski, was really acting as the union members' lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.775" offset="4831905">And in that situation, in that narrow situation, the Court said that there is at least judicial review to require the Secretary to provide a statement of reasons why he hasn't brought an enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.365" offset="4882269">But here there is nothing comparable in the FDA statute, Title IV, and there is nothing that requires the FDA to bring any particular enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.140" offset="4921348">So as I was saying a moment ago, not every violation can be investigated or enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.873" offset="4948307">The resources of the agency are finite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.919" offset="4960532">If it has to bring, pursuant to the D.C. Circuit's order, if it has to bring 15 enforcement proceedings around the country against states that use drugs for capital punishment on the grounds that it's a misbranding violation, those resources are going to be taken away from some other enforcement activity that the agency wants to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.194" offset="5029600">So the question in this case really boils down to who is to decide how the agency's enforcement resources are going to be allocated?</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.440" offset="5062618">Is it going to be the D.C. Circuit or is it going to be the Commissioner of Food and Drugs?</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.813" offset="5080068">Now, for all these reasons we think that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the FDA's decision not to undertake enforcement activity was not subject to judicial review, simply because there's no judicially manageable standards to decide whether a particular enforcement proceeding should have been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.337" offset="5150181">But if we're wrong about that and if the FDA's decision was in fact judicially reviewable, then, as I said a moment ago, the question remains whether the FDA abused its discretion in not bringing the particular enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.098" offset="5201172">I want to spend just a few moments of my remaining time on this secondary aspect of the case which, I repeat, the Court need not reach if it agrees with us that the decision itself is not judicially reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.233" offset="5245789">It is truly hard to fathom how the Court of Appeals could have concluded that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in refusal to involve itself in an area as far removed from its statutory mandate as the investigation of state capital punishment procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.883" offset="5316320">Needless to say, there is not a shred of evidence anywhere in the language or legislative history of the food and drug laws that Congress intended the FDA statute to reach this sort of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.676" offset="5351533">Now, the Respondents' brief contains repeated references to what they say is the "thwarting of Congressional intent" here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.688" offset="5387582">That's the phrase they repeatedly use, the FDA is thwarting Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.608" offset="5403255">We challenge Respondents to cite one provision in the food and drug laws that suggests Congress intended to cover state capital punishment procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.886" offset="5440349">We challenge them to list one statement in the legislative history in which anyone thought that the statute would cover this unique situation, or one statute in any of the agency's regulations, or even one sentence in any court decision construing the food and drug laws, suggesting that anyone until this lawsuit ever thought that the food and drug laws were intended to cover the court-ordered imposition of capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.876" offset="5540346">And I think it takes a fair amount of violence with the statutory language to even fit the states' activity within the statutory terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.295" offset="5573992">The Court of Appeals seemed to think that Texas and Oklahoma were engaging in a misbranding violation, but I think it's fair to say that that conclusion is not intuitively obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.680" offset="5623520">But even if a colorable argument could be made that the drugs used for lethal injections are misbranded because their labels don't list capital punishment as an approved use, and even if we were to somehow conclude that the drugs were held for sale when they were coercively administered to a prisoner, even if we indulge in those two assumptions, then at the very least we think Judge Scalia's dissent shows that a very powerful and respectable argument could be made against that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.697" offset="5755595">It's hard to see how an agency could possibly be said to have abused its discretion in not bringing enforcement proceedings that are sure to be contested and sure to lead to protracted and quite likely unsuccessful litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.599" offset="5811183">In fact, it's not even clear how the D.C. Circuit imagined the whole system would work, because what the D.C. Circuit did is devise, we think, a somewhat strained construction of the food and drug laws that the FDA itself doesn't agree with, and ordered the FDA to bring enforcement proceedings which would surely be contested and lead to litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.277" offset="5897910">And I assume that the District of Columbia Circuit envisioned that the FDA would be presenting in litigation a construction of its statute that it doesn't agree with at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1469.671" offset="6015461">I should add that the agency's fears of disruptive and ultimately futile litigation against the states here are not far-fetched.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.729" offset="6059765">In fact, in recent weeks or recent months they have been proven quite well founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.978" offset="6080767">The Court will recall a couple of months ago the case of Mr. O'Brien, who had been sentenced to death by lethal injection in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.818" offset="6116085">He brought a suit here last March in the District of Columbia based on the Chaney decision, seeking to have the FDA enjoined to seize the drugs that the State of Texas was planning to use for his execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.280" offset="6169897">And the district court here in the District of Columbia, based on the decision below, granted a preliminary injunction requiring the FDA to seize these drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.996" offset="6204796">Within hours, within hours of the grant of that preliminary injunction, the State of Texas had sued the FDA down in Houston, claiming that this was not within the FDA's statutory mandate, and the Fifth Circuit in fact held that the FDA was not acting within its powers in seizing these drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.597" offset="6283164">Surely the FDA acted responsibly and reasonably in conserving its limited enforcement resources for matters much more closely related to its principal mission of protecting consumers in the marketplace from unsafe and ineffective drugs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.525" offset="6386922">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.178" offset="6413567">The Food and Drug Administration aggressively asserts its jurisdiction over the use of drugs on state prisoners in clinical and drug investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.987" offset="6452751">FDA aggressively asserts its jurisdiction with regard to drugs produced to kill animals, to ensure that those drugs will produce a quick and painless death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.265" offset="6489845">In footnote 34 at page 45 of its brief, the Government concedes that if the manufacturers of lethal injection drugs promoted these drugs for this purpose FDA would assert its jurisdiction, would regulate these drugs, and would investigate and make sure that they produced a quick and painless death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.553" offset="6571033">Those three examples are no different from the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.910" offset="6592454">When all is said and done, the only reason the Government has refused to assert its jurisdiction over lethal injection drugs is because it is a state-mandated activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.108" offset="6637280">There is nothing in the statute, there is nothing in the legislative history underlying the statute, that gives any indication that Congress intended state-mandated activities to be exempt from FDA's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.602" offset="6687226">In this Court's decision in United States v. Rutherford, the Court held that the FDA had jurisdiction over Laetrile, even though 17 states had passed statutes allowing the prescription and use of Laetrile by terminally ill cancer patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.112" offset="6749293">FDA itself, with regard to the use of drugs on state prisoners in clinical drug investigations, rejected arguments by the states that FDA somehow was intruding into state penal systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.951" offset="6800597">In short, FDA's argument that it has no jurisdiction here is nothing more than an abnegation of its statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.899" offset="6844378">The issue here is not whether FDA should take some particular regulatory action with regard to lethal injection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.819" offset="6872068">Rather, the issue is a narrow one, and that issue is to what extent will there be judicial review of an executive branch abnegation of a Congressional mandate of enforcement responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.922" offset="6924522">The Administrative Procedure Act provides that all final agency action is subject to judicial review unless it is precluded by statute or unless the action is committed by law to agency discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.135" offset="6973319">This Court in Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner held that there's a strong presumption that favors judicial review of all agency actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.773" offset="7007905">Mr. Geller today argues that the agency has a right to protect its limited resources with regard to enforcement, that it must jealously preserve these resources, that it has budgetary constraints that limit its actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.611" offset="7067255">That is all very true, but that is not the reason why the FDA denied the Respondent's administrative petition here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.265" offset="7097871">That argument was not made in the district court, that argument was not made in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.699" offset="7119605">It is simply a post hoc rationalization of counsel that is made for the first time in this Court by the Solicitor General's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.275" offset="7145936">In any event, there is a clear distinction between an everyday individualistic retail-type enforcement decision in which an agency will have to make a determination whether it should allocate its resources for that enforcement action or not and what has happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.251" offset="7229841">What we have here is a wholesale categorical class-like determination by the FDA, based upon statutory interpretation and based upon what it calls notions of federalism, that it just simply does not have jurisdiction and will not exercise jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.213" offset="7297655">This Court in Office Employees v. National Labor Relations Board held that the Secretary of Labor could not renounce jurisdiction over an entire category of employees, that being unions when they were acting as employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.831" offset="7356169">This Court clearly has jurisdiction to review an agency determination that it does not have jurisdiction under the statute to take an enforcement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.328" offset="7390129">The Government also argues that the agency enforcement decision here is like that of a criminal prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.950" offset="7424610">Criminal prosecutions are brought for the protection of society at large, rather than any particular individual, and no individual has standing to request that a particular prosecution be brought.</text>

            <text syncTime="1848.470" offset="7530667">I was merely stating that criminal prosecutions are brought for the protection of society at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.358" offset="7550207">The Act here, of course, was enacted for the benefit of the public at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.513" offset="7566821">But it was also enacted for the benefit of individuals, those individuals who use drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.417" offset="7586465">Administrative proceedings, unlike criminal prosecutions, have a direct impact on individuals, the individuals for whom Congress enacted the statute either to benefit or to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.772" offset="7639859">The Government studiously ignores this Court's decision in Dunlop v. Bachowski, in which the Court held that the strong presumption in favor of judicial review applies with equal force to agency enforcement decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.454" offset="7690641">In that case, the Bachowski case, the Court held that the Secretary of Labor had failed to carry his heavy burden of showing that Congress did not intend to preclude judicial review of his decision not to enforce the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.150" offset="7757410">Even the cases relied upon by the Government for their claim of an absolute immunity from judicial review, such as the Southern Railway case, do not... support that preposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.130" offset="7797325">In that case, the Court said that it will not lightly interpret a statute to confer upon an agency unlimited discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.441" offset="7826583">The Government argues that if a court were to review its enforcement decision here it would do violence to the doctrine of separation of powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2068.770" offset="8411934">We disagree with Mr. Geller's assertion that the law to apply goes to whether there are standards to judge the FDA's exercise of enforcement discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.876" offset="8464284">Put even if you take that as being the test... and we don't think Pachowski makes it the test or Citizens to Preserve Overton Park makes it the test.</text>

            <text syncTime="2115.362" offset="8598240">We think Section 336 indicates the clear Congressional intent that, with regard to major violations of the statute, the FDA has no enforcement discretion to ignore its enforcement powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2274.205" offset="9233642">The drugs here that are used for lethal injection do have those benefits and are intended to have those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.529" offset="9262899">It is the Government's argument for absolute immunity from judicial review that is anathema to the separation of powers doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.243" offset="9309815">Without judicial review of agency action, there is no guarantee that agencies will observe the Congressional mandates that the statutes provide for them, and there is a chance that the goals of Congress can be negated or frustrated by agency inaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.017" offset="9380868">In short, the strong presumption that favors judicial review of agency action applies to this case, and there is law to apply, given in Section 336 of the Act, given in the preamble, the 1972 preamble, and in other provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.385" offset="9458400">Section 352 of the Act provides that a drug shall be misbranded unless its labeling bears adequate directions for use and adequate warnings against dangerous uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.913" offset="9492463">FDA concedes that there has been no new drug application approved by it for any of these drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.972" offset="9520676">Consequently, the labeling cf these drugs do not bear adequate directions for use as lethal injections, and they are misbranded under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.517" offset="9550873">Section 331(b) of the Act, which you will not find any reference to in the Government's briefs, provides that a misbranding in interstate commerce is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.527" offset="9598938">The Government concedes and the court below found that these drugs are manufactured for distribution and use in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.882" offset="9640316">Therefore, we have a misbranding of a drug and we have the misbranding in interstate commerce, and the jurisdictional nexus for FDA jurisdiction is met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.489" offset="9670723">In addition, Section 331(k) of the act provides that it would be prohibited to misbrand a drug while it is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.079" offset="9717116">The "held for sale" provision is a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.872" offset="9740313">It does not mean technically that the drug has to be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.808" offset="9752016">It merely means distributed to the consumer or the user.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.056" offset="9769048">This Court in United States v. Sullivan, said, and I will quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.805" offset="9783990">"The words of paragraph (k), while such article is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce, apparently were designed to fill this gap and to extend the act's coverage to every article that had gone through interstate commerce until it finally reached the ultimate consumer. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.799" offset="9843967">Several courts have held that the section (k) provision merely means that the channels of interstate commerce have been used and it applies all the way from the point of manufacture up to the ultimate consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.138" offset="9901332">In addition to the express language of the statute and in addition to the 1972 preamble, FDA interpretations and court interpretations also provide law to apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.070" offset="9957129">The cases have uniformly condemned the unapproved use of approved drugs outside the practice of medicine, and that is precisely what we have here, an unapproved use of a drug outside the practice of medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.955" offset="10008643">In addition, as I've already noted, FDA vigorously asserts its jurisdiction over drugs used to produce death in animals, it vigorously asserts its jurisdiction over state prisoners who are used in clinical drug investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.152" offset="10065381">There is absolutely nothing in the statute or in the Congressional history that indicates Congress did not intend that this enforcement decision here is not reviewable, and the Government has not cited anything either in the statute or in the legislative history to support its claim of nonreviewability here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.189" offset="10169557">In fact, in Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner this Court cited the Department of Justice memorandum that was read on the House floor in 1938 at the time the Act was passed, in which the Justice Department at that time argued that the special review provisions set forth in Section 371 of the Act were not really needed, because even without these provisions there would be judicial review if an aggrieved party wanted to complain about an action taken by the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.363" offset="10302259">It's ironic that the Government here is now taking the opposite position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.923" offset="10316470">In short, the Government has failed to meet its heavy burden that Congress intended to preclude judicial review of its nonenforcement decision here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3217.278" offset="13005933">At the end of the road, someone has taken an approved drug and allegedly used it for an unapproved purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.540" offset="13031010">That is a different section of the FDA's responsibilities, and its authority to act is much more uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.913" offset="13056506">The Everest case, for example, which was a decision of the Fifth Circuit, the same circuit that would hear any case involving the State of Texas, had given a fairly narrow construction to that provision of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.440" offset="13098615">So those cases are not in point involving the dogs and the clinical investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.658" offset="13115438">And second and finally, I just want to mention the preamble that Justice Brennan alluded to and which is quoted at pages 24a and 25a of the appendix to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.308" offset="13166011">The preamble, as Justice Brennan noted, was the preamble to an unadopted regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.602" offset="13187223">It has no... the only force it has under the FDA's regulations is as an advisory opinion, and all that means under the FDA's regulations is that the FDA has committed itself not to take action against someone who may have relied on the preamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.708" offset="13239676">The regulations make quite clear that the preamble was not committing the agency to bring an enforcement proceeding against somebody else, and that's made quite clear by the FDA's regulations, which we quote at page 25 of our brief, which retains the agency's inherent authority to decide completely and for itself which enforcement proceedings it would bring.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.589" offset="13323164">Thank you.</text>
