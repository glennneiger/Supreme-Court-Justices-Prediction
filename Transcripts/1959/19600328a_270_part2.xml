            <label>Mr. Samuel D. Slade</label>
            <text syncTime="1.159" offset="108022">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.524" offset="125471">It has been suggested -- looking at the relationship between the title that was taken by the United States and the right reserved in other circumstances to have a paramount lien of security for progress payments, it's been suggested that the right to the paramount lien is somehow merged and lost, where the right to take title under Section 11 (d) has been exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.100" offset="219721">Now, I think it's basic equity law that while normally, equity will merge the junior and senior estates, it will not permit that merger where there's an intervening threat as there clearly is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.234" offset="276355">In that case, the estates will remain separate in the joint holder of both for the protection of the joint holder of both.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.668" offset="302059">So that even if somehow, less than good title was taken under Section 11, the United States would still in the circumstances of this case, be possessed of a perfectly good, outstanding paramount lien, paramount, that is to the right to liens asserted by these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.575" offset="389622">In other words, if we looked only to that aspect of the case, the paramount lien aspect, we would now have the Ansonia case, as the Court will recall involved three ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.050" offset="439568">The Benyuard, as to which title was taken, that one is not really involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.306" offset="452629">The Mohawk and the Galveston, as to which the Government asserted liens in a state court proceeding in Virginia as against other lienholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.412" offset="485021">This Court held and properly, that the liens in that case asserted by the Government were purely the creatures of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.097" offset="515741">An opinion had actually been rendered by the Attorney General prior to the time that case arose, that he was afraid that the liens in navies were using -- were in recognition of in deference to state-created and enforceable liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.766" offset="570389">And this Court held that in that state receivership proceeding, that the Government's liens to secure payments on those two vessels were junior to the Virginia-created and enforceable liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.381" offset="616887">However, directly after that decision, Congress passed the Act of 1911 which is set forth in our brief at page 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.722" offset="658265">So that thereafter, the lien enforced to secure progress payments where that was used instead of pro tanto passage of title, would be paramount to any state-created and enforceable liens.</text>

            <text syncTime="788.247" offset="3256404">When you have a contract entered into like the standard form supply contract, known to all, to all -- suppliers are pretty canny men.</text>

            <text syncTime="804.074" offset="3319620">I think Judge Jones is merely trying to say, given the -- the history crusted relationship between materialmen supplies with government contracts in the Government, they know that whatever happens between the Government and its contractor, under these standard provisions offering various options for various situations is a -- is a paramount thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.972" offset="3403212">And I think Jones is trying to say that, for example, had contract title passed on completion and had it been developed that Rice had never paid any of its supplies and materialmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.553" offset="3449605">He kept them at arm's length.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.873" offset="3454830">He got extensions of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.462" offset="3461204">He gets a full $175,000 for the boats and the United States takes them.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.108" offset="3483773">Certainly, in those circumstances, the materialmen supplies couldn't say to the Government, “you have to pay twice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1356.348" offset="5528743">The point I want to make is that the Government retained 3% of the money which the contractor had earned based upon a percentage of completion.</text>
