            <label>Mr. Elliot Bredhoff</label>
            <text syncTime="10.053" offset="143548">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.143" offset="155982">This case is similar to the two cases that were heard yesterday, the American Manufacturing Company case and the Warrior &amp; Gulf case.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.487" offset="193285">In that, this case involves the interpretation of Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act and the effect of that section has on the enforcement of arbitration provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.587" offset="265697">The difference in this case from the others is that those involved questions of enforcing arbitrability under a contract, under grievance and arbitration provisions of the contract whereas this case involves the enforcement of an award already rendered by an arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.828" offset="370709">The real question, I suppose, boils down to, should the courts review de novo an arbitrator's award which interprets and applies the provisions of a contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="82.167" offset="432044">The facts or I believe in large part undisputed, the contract in this case was between the Steel Workers Union and the Enterprise Company at Huntington, West Virginia which ran for a period of one year from April 5th, 1956 to April 5th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.802" offset="526608">The critical contract clauses that are involved here are Article IV - Suspension and Discharge, which may be found on -- in the record, the first part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.267" offset="580420">The record is in two parts in terms of pagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.209" offset="596198">In -- in the first part, pages 17 and 18 contained the provisions of Article IV dealing with suspension and discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.089" offset="635695">And it is a typical type of suspension and discharge provision found in collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.266" offset="660459">It provides in summary and for no peremptory discharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.461" offset="681253">If an employer wishes to discharge or discipline an employee, he must first invoke a suspension for no more than five days.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.135" offset="719914">He must afford the employee a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.413" offset="729004">He must present the employee with the statement of the offense and he must make the facts available surrounding the offense at the hearing, which he must afford the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.992" offset="775293">After that hearing, the employer is required to make a determination as to wether to extend or suspend -- sustain the discharge -- the -- the suspension or to convert the suspension into a discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.620" offset="845824">If the suspension is converted into a discharge, then the employee has the right to avail himself of the grievance provisions of the contract which are in Article III, were in Article III of the particular contract before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.803" offset="918549">The provisions I've just summarized are the rough equivalent in a collective bargaining agreement of the procedural due process which we know at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.723" offset="958255">It's the -- the rough equivalent in the industrial government of a -- under a collective bargaining agreement of the due process that is to be accorded an employee when he's -- when he is to be suspended or discharged by an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.676" offset="1022098">Now, under the suspension and discharge provision, before we look at the grievance and arbitration machinery, there is a important provision which states, and this is on page 18 of the record, the first part of the record, "Should it be determined by the company or by an arbitrator in accordance with the grievance procedure that the employee has been suspended unjustly or discharged in violation of the provisions of this agreement, the company shall reinstate the employee and pay full compensation at the employee's regular rate of pay for the time lost."</text>
            <text syncTime="268.462" offset="1177266">That is a provision specifying the remedy whenever there is a determination that an employee has been improperly disciplined or discharged by an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.670" offset="1238079">It is in a sense unlike most of the other provisions under a collective bargaining agreement where there are no specific remedies stated in the contract, but there are remedies provided through the law of arbitration and through practices and understandings of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.361" offset="1316864">Now, under Article III of that contract which appears on page 16 of the record, there is a provision that any differences which might arise between the company and the union or its members employed by the company as to the meaning and application of the provisions of this agreement require that an earnest effort shall be made to settle such differences immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.866" offset="1438804">And then, there are steps set forth as to how those differences are to be resolved, the traditional type of steps at ascending levels of authority between the union and the company.</text>

            <label>Mr. Elliot Bredhoff</label>
            <text syncTime="354.723" offset="1522291">And I'll advert to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.139" offset="1527933">There is no dispute in this case at the present time, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.885" offset="1546951">Now, in step four of this particular clause of provision, it is provided that in the event the dispute shall not have been satisfactorily settled in accordance with the above, it shall be submitted at the request of either party to a panel of three members including an impartial member.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.017" offset="1623437">And the final phraseology in that article, the decision of the umpire shall be final and binding on the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.816" offset="1658650">Now, there is also in this contract and this appears on the second part of the record, the pagination on page 7 of the second part of the paginated record.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.129" offset="1723852">This is Section 6 of the grievance and arbitration machinery."</text>
            <text syncTime="411.916" offset="1751019">It is understood and agreed that neither party will institute civil suits or illegal proceedings against the other for alleged violation of any of the provisions of this labor contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.755" offset="1798353">Instead, all disputes will be settled in the manner outlined in this Article III - Adjustment of Grievances."</text>
            <text syncTime="429.904" offset="1823013">This is an unusual clause and a contract, although it is implicit in most collective bargaining agreements that you settle your disputes under the machinery provided in the contract and not take your disputes into the courts or other legal machineries.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.067" offset="1895633">There was, we believe a no-strike clause, although it does not appear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.878" offset="1918934">However, there is no dispute between the parties as to the fact that a no-strike clause existed under this contract because the grievance who are involved in this proceeding were actually disciplined for violation or for alleged violation of what must has been a no-strike prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.639" offset="2025932">Now, the particular facts that led to the discharges in this case are summarized succinctly by the arbitrator at pages 19 through 21 of the second part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.232" offset="2112345">There -- this -- this company in 19 -- late 1956 and early 1957 while the contract wasn't forced, had some 52 to 53 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.385" offset="2164903">On January 17th, 1957, some three months before the contract was to expire -- four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.986" offset="2207326">The -- a group of employees, a committee went into the presidents' office to protest a contemplated discharge of an employee named Medley.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.777" offset="2258526">The employees felt that Medley should not be disciplined and they consulted the president of the company about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.722" offset="2290291">The president stated that he would not change his decision but he told them that they could resort to the grievance machinery if they disagreed with his determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.988" offset="2335326">There was some discussion in the office and the employees returned to the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.219" offset="2364270">At about 1 p.m., the employees were congregated in the washroom and the president of the company saw them there, and told them that they would either have to go back to work for ring out and go outside and figure it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.433" offset="2441070">Ring out of the plant that is and figure out what they were going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.174" offset="2460087">The employees then punched out their timecards and walked outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.714" offset="2474193">The president stated that at that time, he had made no decision to terminate the employment of these men.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.426" offset="2505122">Upon leaving the plant, the grievance consulted the staff representative of the union who advised them to return to work, to file a grievance with respect to Medley, the employee whose suspension they were protesting and to follow the contract procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.263" offset="2588400">They went back to the plant some 30 to 35 minutes after they had initially walked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.056" offset="2615568">They asked the president of the company whether they -- whether they would be able to come back to work and the president said that they could not come back with Medley.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.575" offset="2665723">They then asked, "How about if we keep Medley out, can the rest of us come back in the morning?"</text>
            <text syncTime="645.857" offset="2686830">And the president said yes, they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.603" offset="2693831">They could come back the following morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.227" offset="2708250">However, five minutes later, the president calls his attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.655" offset="2722043">The president of the company called his attorney and the attorney advised him that he was under no obligation to take these employees back.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.462" offset="2753181">The -- the attorney told them that they had quit their employment and they need not -- and that the company need not restore them to employment despite what the president had told them just five minutes previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.906" offset="2810964">The following day, the employees did report for work.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.915" offset="2823084">However, they're timecards were out of the rack and they were told that they did not have employment anymore with that company.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.007" offset="2863417">The employees then filed a grievance on January 23rd, some five days after they were refused reemployment and they protested their discharge, which they alleged was without good cause and they also alleged that it was defective procedurally, meaning, that the suspension and discharge procedures specified in the agreement had not been complied with because they were not handed a five-day suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.657" offset="2973968">They were not given a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.778" offset="2982536">They were not given a statement of the offense and all the facts surrounding the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.063" offset="3011584">They requested reinstatement and all lost pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.578" offset="3029661">The specific remedy provided in the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.751" offset="3042408">They did not request damages in the sense that damages are known under commercial contracts for breaches of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.401" offset="3084936">The company refused to process the grievance in the manner specified in Article III of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.690" offset="3114088">They did hold some discussions after a period of some weeks outside the grievance machinery with some of the union representatives and eventually, it was agreed that the first three steps of the grievance procedure had been complied with, either waived or actually fulfilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.752" offset="3186395">The union -- then on February 17th, some one month after the discharge, requested that the matter be submitted to arbitration in accordance with step four.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.666" offset="3238013">The company refused to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.043" offset="3251493">The company took the position still that the employees had quit, they were not re-employable and there was no arbitrable grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.224" offset="3316276">However, after a considerable period of further discussions between the union and the company officials, the company did agree to submit this matter to arbitration before Arbitrator Milton Schmidt.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.575" offset="3389628">Still later however, after having agreed to submit the matter to arbitration, the company reneged on that agreement and they refused to submit the matter to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.438" offset="3445112">Now, in the meantime, the contract was coming to a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.843" offset="3466742">The April 4th or April 5th date 1957 was approaching and negotiations were taking place for a new contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.840" offset="3506761">The record discloses that the terms of a new contract were actually agreed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.519" offset="3533406">Some wage increases were to be provided for under a new two-year contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.314" offset="3552632">The only thing that prevented the execution of a new contract was the company's insistence that the union withdraw the grievance regarding the 11 employees who had been discharged from the arbitration process.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.607" offset="3625775">The company said they would sign a contract so long as the union insisted on processing the -- the grievance through the arbitration process under the expired contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="901.975" offset="3711248">I -- I'm going to come to that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.724" offset="3722219">The -- there was no new contract actually entered into in written form because of the company's insistence on this condition, the -- the union advised the company that it could not possibly waive the rights of the 11 employees involved, that was 20% of the workforce and they instead went on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.560" offset="3817618">After some time, the employees became hard pressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.867" offset="3838830">They consulted their union representative and indicated they would like to go back to work if they could arrange to go back to work under the old -- under the -- the terms that had been tentatively agreed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.068" offset="3891597">The employees were advised by the union representative that they could consult with the president of the company, which they did, and they made arrangements to go back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.507" offset="3937364">There is some dispute as to precisely what those arrangements were.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.585" offset="3953664">The employees and the union contend that they went back to work under the terms that had been previously agreed upon and without any waiver of the -- the grievance they've submitted to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.343" offset="4016776">The company claims that it made no deal with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.968" offset="4035271">However, the company president did say we never a -- this is on page 36 of the second portion of the record."We never agreed on what was in the negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.112" offset="4087829">The agreement was made with the men.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.870" offset="4098800">They were outside the fence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.194" offset="4108100">We made the agreement between them without the union being there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.167" offset="4124087">So it appears that there was an agreement by which the employees returned to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.001" offset="4143417">It was never reduced to writing and it -- it seems that there was at least a de facto arrangement governing their relationship after they returned to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.398" offset="4204962">Now, after the union found that it could not submit the matter to arbitration because of the company's refusal, the union instituted a suit in the Federal District Court under Section 301, requesting specific performance of Article III of the agreement, the grievance and arbitration procedure of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.130" offset="4303914">The company answered and the union moved for summary judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.863" offset="4318856">The matter was heard on the pleadings and affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.708" offset="4334216">The Court granted the union's motion for summary judgement and in an oral opinion, the Court indicated that the union was not seeking damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.292" offset="4376534">The union was simply seeking enforcement of the provision of the agreement which required that all differences as to interpretation and application of the contract be resolved in the final stage by arbitration and by final and binding arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.869" offset="4446856">The Court rejected a company argument that the matter had become moot because of the intervening expiration of the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1191.747" offset="4870353">The arbitrator, Arbitrator Schmidt, issued his award on April 10th, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.088" offset="4895744">He held that the employees had not quit but were in fact discharged.</text>

            <text syncTime="1221.595" offset="4989785">He also found the company had failed to -- to abide by the suspension and discharge provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.618" offset="5013817">The procedural due process protections under the contract and he rejected the mootness agreement, specifically, he said that the controversy as to the employees right to reinstatement and that case is a continuing one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.579" offset="5077661">Article IV of the contract, he held, impose an unconditional obligation on the company to reinstate the employees with the back pay saved, the 10-day suspension period that he held proper and he also excluded from the back pay any -- any earnings that the employees may have had at -- in other employments during the period they were not working for the company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1351.647" offset="5509935">Also, the employer attempted to get the union to waive the rights of the employees as the condition for a new contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.551" offset="5581615">The union was then forced to go into the Federal District Court to obtain a show cause order as to why the employer should not abide by the arbitrator's award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.163" offset="5643995">This was done on November 25th, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.524" offset="5665520">The company answered, the Court issued a show cause order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.060" offset="5683597">And on December 16th, 1958, the District Court issued an order and the written opinion in which he ordered the company to comply with all the provisions of the arbitration award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.997" offset="5739395">The judges' opinion appears on the first part of the record at pages 3 through 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.914" offset="5775026">The judge pointed out that the case is being prosecuted by the union primarily to obtain reinstatement of the workers with the monetary award, a secondary consideration to the company argument that the arbitrator had exceeded his authority by ordering reinstatement and back pay for a period beyond the contract expiration date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.936" offset="5875127">The Court said this, "An investigation of all the cases cited by the company that is to reveal that in each of them, the discharged employees accepted the termination of their employment and suit for damages for the wrongful discharge without seeking reinstatement."</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.308" offset="5948583">He noted that the men involved were elderly men and that reinstatement was far more critical to them than any back pay or any monetary damages that might be due them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.609" offset="5997798">And the added at pages 10 and 11 of the record, the first part of the record, the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.744" offset="6038340">To allow the defendant to only reimburse the employees up until April 4th, 1957 would be to allow the defendant to profit unfairly from its own wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.716" offset="6082226">If the man had not been unjustly discharged, it must be assumed that their employment would have been continued today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.111" offset="6107826">Until reinstated, these employees continue to suffer loss of wages by virtue of the defendant's improper action, irrespective of any expiration of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.506" offset="6157354">The company then appealed to the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals at -- on the particular issue involved here whether the award may include reinstatement and back pay for the period after the contract had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.544" offset="6237497">The Court of Appeals said that the award of back pay for the period subsequent to April 4, 1957 could not be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.972" offset="6271248">The Court reasoned that the cause collective bargaining agreements do not create a permanent status or condition, or given indefinite tenure or extend rights created and arising under the contract beyond its terms, it falls that the employees who were discharged unlawfully could not enforce an award for back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.119" offset="6347839">The Court modified the judgement so as to limit the recovery of wages just to the period of the contract expiration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.576" offset="6693700">Now, perhaps we can refine that issue a bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.163" offset="6711986">The company contention is that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction -- lack jurisdiction to award any relief running beyond the contract expiration date either reinstatement or money damage -- or -- or an award of back pay beyond that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.879" offset="6782934">But, when the company contends that, it is the same as saying that the matter of reinstatement and back pay after the contract date was not arbitrable to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.330" offset="6828701">And in that sense, it is similar to the issues that we had here yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.740" offset="6854301">If the arbitrator did -- didn't have jurisdiction to make that kind of an award, well, that issue was not arbitrable in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.223" offset="6892231">And in -- in the cases yesterday, we urged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.656" offset="6913964">My brother Feller urged that the Court in deciding arbitrability should look to see whether there was a claim alleged under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.675" offset="6962030">When the issue was posed in terms of enforcing an award, we believe the Court should look only to the question as to whether the arbitrator interpreted or applied the provisions of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.861" offset="7014797">It is sort of the other side of the coin or the tail end of the same type of inquiry in question which is presented when an arbitrability issue is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.931" offset="7059101">We do not believe that the Court should look into whether the arbitrator's interpretation or application was correct under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.039" offset="7091493">And that is backed up by perhaps a hundred years or more of common law doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.131" offset="7123884">We only believe that the Court should determine whether he decided initially under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.232" offset="7156276">And we may illustrate that by an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.873" offset="7170905">My brother Feller talked yesterday about an end of the contract providing $3 per hour for a job plus 12 jobs let us say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.051" offset="7199535">And the employee demands $3.50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.962" offset="7215208">Well, if the employee had claimed the $3.50 because he said that he was just being underpaid and it was unfair, we conceded yesterday that would not have been arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.279" offset="7264528">But suppose he actually he claimed he was entitled to the $3 -- $3.50 under the contract and the issue did go to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.197" offset="7300159">And the arbitrator finally decided, "Well, the contract didn't give him that right but he thinks other companies are paying $3.50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.931" offset="7339133">The company ought to pay this employee $3.50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.314" offset="7352613">That would be beyond his jurisdiction because he was not interpreting the provisions of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.822" offset="7378631">But that issue was not arbitrable in the first instance anyway and not properly arbitrable because it was -- it was an improper claim to begin with that it's true it did go to arbitration, but if the claim had been a proper claim, it -- it really was not in the arbitration category.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Beatty</label>
            <text syncTime="2961.726" offset="11950268">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.817" offset="11970644">I hardly think because I'm replying to the Warrior case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.088" offset="11983705">I would like to go into the facts again if I might to sort of bring our thinking back to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.087" offset="12027695">Now, as Mr. Bredhoff has pointed out to you, this was a contract which was entered into on April 5, 1956 to terminate at midnight on April 4, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.973" offset="12079313">There were no provisions for renewals or continuances in that contract clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.272" offset="12104495">And -- and he has also indicated that Article IV and Article III of the agreement are key sections to the agreement that we are here discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.687" offset="12162069">Article IV deals with unjust suspension or peremptory discharge in the wording of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.808" offset="12194565">Article III is the grievance procedure, the four-step grievance procedure ending up with arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.760" offset="12222464">And the important words at the beginning of that Section 1, differences arising as to meaning and application of the provisions of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.881" offset="12270947">Those are the words that prefaced the entire four-step grievance procedure and then you come down to arbitration as your final step.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.478" offset="12313266">Now, as Mr. Bredhoff has told you, on January 18th, 1957, some three or four months before the contract was to expire, their grievance, of 11 men arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.516" offset="12373452">The company maintained that they quit their position and therefore, there was no arbitrable issue involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.548" offset="12409605">And at the time, the bargaining unit consisted of 52 employees and that was about the extent of the number of employees that enterprise had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.220" offset="12444296">They had a -- a couple of clerical employees in the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.649" offset="12461955">Now, arbitration was asked for and finally, the company denied arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.592" offset="12493720">Then, the contract expired in April 1957 and the matter arose there until -- on July 3rd, 1957, unfair labor practice charges were filed before the National Labor Relations Board, maintaining that there had been a -- a failure to bargain and also that there had been a discrimination against these men that were discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.704" offset="12594239">The complaint was refused by the Board, not sufficient evidence to support it, on August 12th 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.470" offset="12625272">Now, this was in the time when Lincoln Mills sort -- had just been decided, if the Court will recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.802" offset="12654529">Then the procedure -- the next step in the procedure was to go to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.433" offset="12677099">Now, bear in mind, that it is our position here that that contract expired absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.773" offset="12706461">There was no new agreement entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.975" offset="12719313">The arbitrator in his -- what he denominates, his decision on award and a little prefatory discussion states -- and this is in the record, 2A 18, this is in appendix record made up of two sections out of the appendix of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.788" offset="12778559">Well, he states that there was no new contract, a union counsel in colloquy with the Court, in one of these proceedings, admits that there was no new contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.197" offset="12820146">And affidavits filed on behalf of the employee -- employer also shows that there was no new contract or no new contractual relationships other than this, that the men apparently had -- had gone out and they wanted to go back to work and they came back, and the company agreed to take them back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.452" offset="12889213">And there had been some noted negotiation as to wages and the company anxiously took them back at a higher wage than had been discussed in any negotiation as to the -- enterprise has continued to operate these three years now without any contract with the union at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.169" offset="12960057">They have bargained on occasions with them but they have operated without contract with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.293" offset="12976567">Now, that's -- that gives us the point as to this -- of this case before it went in to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.423" offset="13001017">And now, in August of 1957, an action was brought to compel specific performance in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, asking that enterprise be compelled to comply with Article III, step four on the grievance -- procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.028" offset="13087535">A hearing, winding up in the summary judgment motion determined on October of 1957, that the company should submit to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.217" offset="13136227">Now, there was nothing said in this -- the -- the Court -- Court has a sort of a memorandum of opinion, t wasn't reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.909" offset="13171022">But it -- it was an oral opinion that was delivered from the -- the bench and is reported here in the -- in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.858" offset="13198817">The Court doesn't discuss anything about reinstatement rights going beyond the period of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.916" offset="13223058">Now, I might add it was an enterprise's initial position after the arbitrator made his award.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.365" offset="13260884">Now, the arbitrator said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.673" offset="13266108">He said, "First, you must reinstate these men."</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.636" offset="13277915">Now, bear in mind, his -- his award came in April -- April 10th of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.281" offset="13296515">This was sometime after the -- the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.647" offset="13313964">And I'm not talking about where they went in to force us to arbitrate, I'm just getting a little bit ahead, but you have -- you have to understand that our position has been that the arbitrator said that there could be reinstatement after the period of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.515" offset="13381465">That the men would get lost compensation after the period of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.804" offset="13406542">However, that would be subjected to a offset for other earnings during the period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.602" offset="13429739">And the enterprise from the beginning has said that they would recognize that portion of the award up to the termination date of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.039" offset="13463489">But that they felt that the arbitrator had exceeded his authority and had gone beyond the scope of that contract in awarding reinstatement and back pay beyond the period of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.765" offset="13506435">Now, I'll go back to where the Court ordered specific performance and -- and ordered them -- enterprise to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.586" offset="13537677">They submitted the arbitration and it was held on January 3rd of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.760" offset="13562441">And then in April -- April 10th, 1958, the award was made and that the decision and award of the arbitrator is set forth in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.411" offset="13604968">And as I say, it constituted the matters that I have discussed here just a moment ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="3511.569" offset="14149674">I think it was raised in Lincoln Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.557" offset="14161586">The fact they raised -- they raised mootness there and they couldn't make these accommodations for job rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.724" offset="14190320">I think there were certain provisions in there that they had to make, arrangements for seniority in that sort of thing as I recall this is offhand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.199" offset="14220204">But what the Court did say there, they said, "Well, it's not moot as to monetary damages."</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.447" offset="14245177">And the District Court, at the bottom of page 15, I quoted that language from -- from Lincoln Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.242" offset="14272345">The language was, insofar as -- this is a quote from Lincoln Mills, "Insofar as the grievances of the restoration work loads and jobs assignments, the case is of course moot but to the extent that they sought a monetary award, the case is a continuing controversy."</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.368" offset="14320828">Now, that's about all but I can see in there, that -- that was said as to the -- the monetary damages or the -- the remedy that -- that they might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.799" offset="14366595">Now, as -- as I was -- was saying after the arbitration award occurred -- now, this was in April -- April of 1958, then the matter lay at rest there and -- until all November of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.455" offset="14453217">And then a show cause proceeding was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.687" offset="14462098">Now, that's the second proceeding where we get the second opinion of the District Court and the reported opinion of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.810" offset="14486653">Now, in the show cause proceeding, they asked the -- the company, they made show cause while they should not comply with the arbitrator's award.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.547" offset="14525524">The company then filed what it denominated as its answer in resistance to the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.395" offset="14553004">And it maintained that first, that there was lack of jurisdiction on the part of the Court to determine this matter for the reason that it was contrary to the decision of this Court in the Westinghouse Salaried Employees case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.971" offset="14611205">The -- the theory there being, and this is not at issue here, but it is, I think, important to see the background of the case, we get the posture of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.983" offset="14635342">The theory there being that it was a right that was peculiar to individual employees and wasn't a right that the union have to assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.996" offset="14667316">Then in -- in the alternative to the merits, the company raised the -- the same defenses that they have -- have consistently to the Court of Appeals and the same thing virtually that we're asserting here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.125" offset="14723845">The first, that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority in going beyond the termination date of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.345" offset="14748714">That he added to and -- and made something out of that contract that wasn't contemplated by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.946" offset="14771179">Then, there was a second proposition which I assume has managed from the case now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.868" offset="14794794">And that -- that was that the award was not found in detriment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.693" offset="14814124">As you -- you recall, I pointed out that they allowed a set off for wages that -- in other words, that were earned in the outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.870" offset="14842859">The arbitrator did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.229" offset="14848293">He didn't provide any particular formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.335" offset="14860727">He didn't -- to provide any particular amount and I don't believe any evidence was taken on that in the arbitration proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.650" offset="14889984">So, that was another point that we raised, that this was indefinite type of award and under our theory that it was totally void and there should -- therefore, should be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.263" offset="14928436">Now, we argued before the District Court as well as before the Court of Appeals that the entire thing was void and should be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.539" offset="14961560">Now, after that, the District Court decided that he did have jurisdiction of the matter, that we should comply with the award and ordered compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.993" offset="14999385">And then we took a time, we appealed to the -- the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.649" offset="15014013">And before the Court of Appeals, we made substantially the same argument that we made before the -- the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.222" offset="15044211">And we came up with this result, the Court of Appeals held that the award did go beyond the scope of the authority of the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.047" offset="15099591">That the award, insofar as it allow the monitory compensation after the termination day of the contract should be stricken down, the reinstatement should be stricken down and that the enterprise should pay for the time lost during the period of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.753" offset="15178376">And also, the Court said that -- that it was indefinite in the sense that there were no criteria to mathematically calculate how these awards, how -- how these offset of compensation should be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.330" offset="15224665">And we have pointed out that, like the National Labor Relations Board uses a quarterly system for example, taking in on a three month average.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.469" offset="15257266">And there is a possibility of offsetting wages earned over the total period against the total -- I mean the -- wages earned outside over the total period against wages that could have been earned with the company during the total period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.220" offset="15316302">And -- and there's other ways of -- of computing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.489" offset="15325288">The Court said there that it should go back to arbitration, to -- to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.544" offset="15345560">Now, what the Court did at all times here, the Court was familiar with the Lincoln Mills decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.035" offset="15367502">And it was attempting to protect as much of this award as it possibly could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.080" offset="15391744">It was showing deference to the arbitrator's award.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.699" offset="15402193">We didn't contest the merits that the -- that the discharge -- and once the -- the arbitrator said that the discharge had been too severe a penalty, we didn't contest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.860" offset="15462797">Now, and -- and bear in mind too that the arbitrator said that while penalty of discharge was too severe, he said he did think the men were wrong in walking out and not taking their -- a grievance to the grievance procedure and therefore, he would apply a 10-day suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.572" offset="15533641">In -- in other words, the company would get credit for 10 days, but those men should have been disciplined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.710" offset="15550255">So, this wasn't a -- a discriminatory type claim on the part of the company in the arbitrator so -- so recognized that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.497" offset="15585364">The Court of Appeals then attempted to protect this award and showed deference to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.280" offset="15616502">They didn't attempt to go into the merits of the situation and offset what he held about the discharge or go into the evidence in any manner and we didn't contest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.508" offset="15653386">The only thing that we contested was what went beyond the scope of the authority of the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="4398.021" offset="17695431">Well, now, the law if there's no contract, doesn't protect against the unjust faring, it protects against the discrimination under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="4413.633" offset="17757915">The -- the point being that after this contract terminated, this men or anybody that continued could have been discharged if they didn't like the color of their hair.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.735" offset="17794278">Now, that might be taking the -- I mean the most harsh example of it but certainly, the employer did not have limitations imposed upon him by any contract and he could fire or hire as he please.</text>
            <text syncTime="4434.275" offset="17840462">And I think that the arbitrator at least his decision of award on -- that's 23 in the second part of the record, hence, to indicate that he wasn't relying upon the specific language of the contract, that he was relying upon some sort of mistaken interpretation that the law gave -- gave these men rights after the contract had terminated, which it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.549" offset="17933563">And we know that there was no discrimination in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4483.360" offset="18036799">We feel that this is the area that has not been marked off for industrial jurisprudence of the law of the shops so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.962" offset="18079222">This is the thing where you deal with the bargain and exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.056" offset="18099597">We're -- the functional aspects of the contract here are much the same as in any other kind of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4505.459" offset="18125197">Now, you can say there are such things in ordinary contract which I seriously doubt if there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.112" offset="18143796">But certainly, there are principles that apply to trust and dentures, requirements, contracts, the sale of real estate in the -- the functional area of bargain and exchange that would apply to a collective bargaining contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.235" offset="18200325">Here, we're -- we're in the area now of attempting to determine what these people bargained for.</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.000" offset="18223417">And we're in that area where Professor Cox says, "The imperative which requires a body of industrial jurisprudence within the general area worked off for joint government, has no place in deciding what area has been marked off."</text>
            <text syncTime="4544.792" offset="18282559">Then we find that the problem is to be solved by general principles, attempting to determine whether or not he can remake a contract that's been entered into between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4558.633" offset="18337938">In the general arbitration field -- now, this is where we get into the cases that we discussed before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4564.655" offset="18361971">In the general arbitration field, the arbitrator has long been prohibited from remaking a contract for imposing additional burdens upon the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4574.986" offset="18403349">There's certainly -- I don't think any question about that and the union doesn't question the fact that I don't think anyone that Justice Frankfurter points out here, that if you go beyond the scope, why you can -- the award becomes invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4588.415" offset="18457057">The union doesn't question that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.093" offset="18467715">And as I pointed out, the -- the general law of arbitration has been to that effect, state decisions, arbitration decisions on down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.262" offset="18508466">If you go beyond the contemplation of the parties as reflected in the contract, you obviously exceed your jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4608.460" offset="18537200">The fact that there is language in the contract to the effect that it shall be final and binding, doesn't mean that that completely bars you from going into a Court, it just merely means that it's the things within the submission or within the scope you are bound, the res judicata within the agreement so to speak, if you have the jurisdiction or the authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.082" offset="18619747">They -- they make some -- some -- something to do of that language but we say that that's all that language means and the cases so hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.320" offset="18660603">Now, we had a contract here that was not renewed or no new contract came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.539" offset="18689546">All -- all rights stem from the contract and these people were protected to April 4 of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.056" offset="18723610">Then you look to some of the general law recording what -- collective bargaining contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.339" offset="18748688">And you'll find that it's -- the damages for wrongful discharge under a collective bargaining contract are limited to the earliest date when an employee can be lawfully discharged.There's a substantial authority for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.611" offset="18813785">The recovery is limited to the -- to the date of the contract termination and there is none after the time that it could be effectively determinated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.927" offset="18851088">It said that collective bargaining agreements, don't create a permanent status and they don't give an indefinite tenure or the extend rights created and arising under a contract beyond its life when it's terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.727" offset="18910229">In our -- we cited the System Federation case which was a Court of Appeals decision from the Fifth Circuit which is -- has some of the similar attributes of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.750" offset="18954324">And at page 39 of our brief, there's extensive language set out from that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4719.047" offset="18979610">On page 39 particularly, in italics, there's this language that dealt with the situation where a man had been furloughed within the period of one contract, wrongfully furloughed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4729.404" offset="19020988">And after the contract had expired, they asked for a reinstatement and back wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.441" offset="19041155">And the Court had this to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="4735.668" offset="19046066">They said they could not because the contract had been breached as to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4739.683" offset="19062053">Claim that the breach had extended its life so as to entitle them to time lost and reinstatement after its abrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.611" offset="19093817">We -- we insist that that is true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4751.162" offset="19108028">Now, as I pointed out that we don't believe that even if you say that you must rely on this language regarding interpretation, we point out that this was the -- was not a broad arbitration clause saying that any and all dispute shall be subjected to arbitration.This was the narrow-type clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.635" offset="19193919">It's the conventional-type clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="5400.765" offset="21706480">Now, at some place along the line even if you take the view that -- that they had to be in -- reinstated over this long interim period, after the contract expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="5410.460" offset="21745246">Certainly, we had a right to terminate them during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5413.708" offset="21758203">And there's been a manifestation of that right, that many occasions along here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5418.239" offset="21776280">So, you -- you have that problem of -- of when do these rights cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="5423.649" offset="21798013">And certainly, we say that the union says, we haven't specifically fire a number and we said we don't want them back but we've done everything but write a notice to that effect even though you would say that -- that the -- the arbitrator was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.317" offset="21856632">We have manifested an intention that we did want them after the expiration date of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5443.502" offset="21877426">And that has been discussed somewhat in -- there has been no allusion in oral argument to that, but in the references to the (Inaudible) case by the union in its brief which we feel -- we feel (Inaudible) is not controlling here because it had a national security overtones, and it was pointed at protecting individual rights in a grave referring problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5468.066" offset="21975646">It's not -- it's not this type of thing where we're dealing with -- with contract rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5471.732" offset="21990275">There, the Court was faced evidently with the -- the problem of removing what a man called a "badge of infamy" that it had been attached to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="5481.273" offset="22028413">And they felt that that case, the -- the way they reached the conclusion was to give rights back to a man, that had been taken away from in procedurally and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5492.241" offset="22072299">We do not feel that that case controls and I might add that in closing, that we don't feel that there has been -- there is any overall arm -- as a matter of fact, we find that what has been done here does not conflict and it is entirely consistent with the national labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5514.527" offset="22161429">The union have -- has not made mention of that in their opening statement but I did want to call it to the attention of the Court, enclose that we do not feel that the labor processes are being impinged upon by the Court of Appeals decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5529.897" offset="22222973">And as we earlier pointed out, the Court attempted to provide and protect, provide for and protect that arbitration award by separating the valid from the invalid and following the later cases to that effect, that if you can't separate the valid from the invalid portion of award, then you may so do and say that this -- this is a valid portion and we'll just strike down the invalid portion and not the entire award.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.275" offset="22336449">It was entirely consistent with Lincoln Mills and with the opinions of this Court in Lincoln Mills to use their judicial inventiveness to -- looking at -- at the federal law, the -- a number of express statutory mandate and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5580.653" offset="22425997">And to attempt to come forth with some sort of national law and collective bargaining contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5587.131" offset="22451911">There is nothing, we submit, in the opinion of the Court of Appeals or in the result that was obtained that is inconsistent with that national labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5596.436" offset="22489109">As a matter of fact, it was an attempt to follow the -- the path or the pioneering path that had been setup for those course to follow and to protect that award to the greatest extent possible following principles of arbitration law and not in a posit principles adopted from contract law but a posit principles adopting them over into this field and coming forth with the result which it had.</text>
            <text syncTime="5626.007" offset="22607391">It has been -- and there -- there is a considerable amount of money involved even in the award in -- in giving money up until the time that the contract expires.</text>
            <text syncTime="5637.308" offset="22652635">Now, something has been made of the policy or I mean from the policy aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5642.412" offset="22673011">The union makes the argument that here, you're going to let the employer get away with something that he's going to be able for the -- the arbitration procedure by being able to delay arbitration until the expiration of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5658.236" offset="22736332">Now, that is not so, because he is faced with, one, his great economic sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.888" offset="22758902">No employer is going to deliberately let a contract rise with the idea of saying it's not arbitrable and allow damages to accrue during the period of the contract against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5674.208" offset="22800175">Secondly, he's got the economic pressure of a strike stream in the place.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.866" offset="22822849">And certainly, if -- if he doesn't comply with this contract, he's got back the content with and I don't think that it can be said that any reasonable employer is going to sit back and just dream up excuses purporting this type of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5694.586" offset="22881677">We don't feel that this will impede arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.700" offset="22898186">Well, I might add that certainly if it is determined that under one of this conventional type clauses, that the Court does not or is not the final determinant of whether or not the arbitrator is acting within the scope of his authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5715.101" offset="22963806">Now, this is all the conventional clause and there's going to be a many -- of an employer before he had something that he did not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="5721.418" offset="22989093">And that it is going to, I would say, fourth arbitration to the extent that there will be many devises, or attempts to develop devises to avoid arbitration altogether or to, at least limit it to an extent that perhaps might not be good if it encroaches upon this area of industrial jurisprudence they were speaking of.</text>
            <text syncTime="5746.664" offset="23090030">I would like to thank the Court for its indulgence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5748.768" offset="23098493">And, gentlemen, it's been a pleasure appearing before you.</text>

            <text syncTime="5792.676" offset="23274036">An arbitrator didn't have the authority to find that there was an obligation to reinstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5798.589" offset="23297755">And he said, "If you wanted to provide in an agreement that if a man was discharged during the term of that agreement, an arbitrator could after the term order him reinstated, why -- why didn't you provide it?"</text>

            <text syncTime="5911.946" offset="23751137">He construed, the arbitrator construed that provision as requiring the employer to reinstate this man even after the contract had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="5920.509" offset="23785409">And he was doing his job of interpreting and implying the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5924.559" offset="23801605">He certainly -- what Mr. Beatty says, as he's got no right to interpret that clause of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5929.407" offset="23821040">He exempts that clause from the total agreement which the arbitrator has given authority to interpret in the plot.</text>
            <text syncTime="5936.601" offset="23849775">And I'd simply don't know of the basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5938.392" offset="23856985">I like to address myself to Mr. Justice Whittaker's question, which implied -- but really that goes to Mr. Beatty's argument which is based on the law of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="5947.424" offset="23893034">That damages run to the end of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5950.447" offset="23905155">The argument that after all -- this is kind of silly if you say you'd have to reinstate him but the employer can fire him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5956.380" offset="23928874">Well, maybe the parties wrote a silly contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5959.302" offset="23940577">The arbitrator said that's the contract and you have to reinstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5963.203" offset="23956146">As a practical matter, and I don't know whether this Court is a judge on that, the arbitrator maybe, that's not very silly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5969.362" offset="23980805">Reinstating a man and then fire him has a far different consequence in the industrial field, industrial relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.482" offset="24021347">They're not reinstating him and just giving him some money.</text>
            <text syncTime="5982.779" offset="24034513">The requirement which the arbitrator found in his agreement that you reinstated, it maybe that you can then fire him if there is no new contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5990.817" offset="24066591">But what will happen in your plan, it would be far different -- if you didn't reinstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5996.784" offset="24090520">The point is and -- and let me say that the incredible thing is that this question -- we've just been through the American Manufacturing case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6005.250" offset="24124374">Nobody ever suggested there that Sparks didn't have a good grievance for reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6010.343" offset="24144750">In the Lincoln Mills case, which the court below refer, if Your Honors will remember in that case, the question involved work loads, how many spindles a man have to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6022.658" offset="24193964">In the Textile Mills, the grievance was filed right at the very end of the contract and the question came here -- and nobody said it was moot because the contract expired and there wasn't no newer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6032.828" offset="24234715">What they said was it was moot because the plant shut down.</text>
            <text syncTime="6037.185" offset="24252061">And therefore, it became immaterial what the spindles was, and the Court said "Well, if the plant shut down."</text>
            <text syncTime="6043.388" offset="24276929">The opinion of the Court said, "That would make the question of the work assignments moot but then, you have the damage question which sustained, but nobody suggested that because the contract terminated, the obligation to make good, to do what you should have done during the contract term didn't continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6062.219" offset="24352266">What this employer should have done, what he is required to do under the contract is reinstate these people, not pay damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="6069.443" offset="24381106">There's no -- this is not a contract for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="6071.499" offset="24389360">The contract says, "If you discharge this man wrongfully, then reinstate him."</text>
            <text syncTime="6076.526" offset="24409527">And that right vested at the time during the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6080.670" offset="24426036">The arbitrator found something.</text>
            <text syncTime="6081.964" offset="24431261">And he found that not having complied with that obligation, the employer had a continuing obligation to reinstate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6087.148" offset="24451950">Of course, the back pay run along but that's employer's fault not our fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="6090.836" offset="24466683">As far as we're concerned, then people would never have been fired in the first place, or would have been reinstated when we asked them to be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6096.576" offset="24489671">But if he wants to drag us through litigation twice to enforce arbitration in the first place and -- and force compliance to the award in the second place, he manufactures his own problems which are not damages, strictly speaking but reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6112.042" offset="24551528">Now, I want to advert in the few minutes I have left to the problems which were raised in the earlier part of the -- deal with Mr. -- or argument with Mr. Bredhoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="6125.438" offset="24605132">I think, we have made our position clear and I think there may have been an inadvertent response to a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6130.849" offset="24626761">But -- but the question which we've made, and I would like to answer Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question, where he said, "Could you not write the agreements so that there'll no -- be no question for the Court?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6140.934" offset="24667094">Obviously, you could right an agreement, so there's no question to report.</text>
            <text syncTime="6145.447" offset="24685171">As a matter of fact, the -- that depends on what kind of arbitration agreement you -- you write.</text>
            <text syncTime="6150.879" offset="24706905">You can write a broad arbitration agreement, a narrow arbitration agreement, an agreement which limits arbitration to discharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="6158.535" offset="24737520">There are such cases saying the only thing that can be subject with -- the arbitration is discharges and you negotiate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6165.517" offset="24765419">One of the issues in collective bargaining very often is, "What shall be the scope of arbitration?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6172.353" offset="24792795">The strike in Henderson, North Carolina Textile Workers where it had been described, was about the issue of the scope of arbitration, where there should be arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="6181.162" offset="24828008">You can have strikes about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6183.133" offset="24835950">But our point in Warrior &amp; Gulf was that none of the negotiating -- none of the evidence put in dealt with any negotiation about the arbitration clause but dealt with managements rights to contract and the subcontract.</text>
            <text syncTime="6197.841" offset="24894777">And that we said to have nothing to do with the arbitration clause which have been in the contract for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6204.099" offset="24919751">And what you are arguing and introducing what the Court relied on to find out the grievance was not arbitrable, wasn't the grievance in substance was no good because of negotiating history.</text>
            <text syncTime="6214.777" offset="24962487">And we said that was improper and, Mr. Lang's in this Court to convert evidence dealing with a proposal for this section to the contrary fact into -- import them through that door and say every -- really amounts to saying, every bit of negotiating history as to the substance of the contract, merely relates to the arbitration provision because if it's clear to be -- a grievance wouldn't be no good.</text>
            <text syncTime="6239.382" offset="25060916">Then it won't be arbitrable and therefore, it limits the arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="6242.798" offset="25074604">And of course, we never argue and never conceded that that kind of evidence was either competent or material or relevant to the question of the scope of the arbitration clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="6301.165" offset="25308035">We have the Automobile Worker's contract say, "Questions of production standards be to the line shall not be subject to arbitration."</text>
            <text syncTime="6313.147" offset="25355995">And they've excluded this from the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="6315.028" offset="25363519">That's very important to them to exclude it from the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="6319.213" offset="25380237">Now, then the question is, if there were extrinsic evidence to deal with the -- what the parties meant when they excluded that from the arbitration provision, would that be relevant to the question of whether the grievance is an arbitrable one from the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6333.857" offset="25438751">You -- I think it would be relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6334.932" offset="25443140">I -- I don't want to get in to the question of parole evidence rule and whether you go behind the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="6341.523" offset="25469471">Then, the evidence which is involved in Warrior &amp; Gulf and as a matter of fact, I do not know of a case.</text>
