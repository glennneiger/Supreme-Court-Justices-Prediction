            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="14.484" offset="161311">The Court please, this is a search and seizure case which until 10 days ago represented two principal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.535" offset="201540">The first issue was whether when state officers illegally seized evidence without any federal participation in that seizure, such evidence was admissible in a federal prosecution and the second principal issue is whether the rule of the Rea case in the 350 U.S., was a rule of comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.763" offset="294431">That was the case which held, as Your Honors will recall, that where a federal court suppresses the results of a search by federal officers, it showed enjoined those federal officers from testifying concerning that seizure in a subsequent state prosecution and this case presents the converse of that situation namely, a state court which has suppressed the fruits of a state seizure whether that court may enjoin the state officers who participated from testifying in a subsequent federal prosecution based on the same evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.593" offset="441762">Now, until 10 days ago, those were the only issues because it was conceded at the hearing of -- on the motion to suppress, it was conceded by the United States attorney on the motion to suppress that the state seizure had been illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.121" offset="515845">I will read from page 80 of the record, “Mr. Lackey, that's the U.S. attorney for the District of Oregon, I think we can take the position, Your Honor, without saying that we either accept or disbelieve that it was or was not an illegal search and seizure that for the purposes of this matter we may treat it as illegal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="125.698" offset="606124">And then ten days ago when the prosecution's brief was file here, that concession which had never been questioned or withdrawn in any stage and on the basis of which an appeal was taken, certiorari was applied for and granted on the record designated, the prosecution undertakes to reargue that case, whether in view of the holding in Abel decided today they can do so, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.322" offset="720645">I shouldn't think so unless, of course, we have one rule for concessions made by the movement on motions to suppress and another for the United States attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.013" offset="759411">Now, the facts in this case and I will try to state them in brief compass are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.682" offset="782085">The case originates in May 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.288" offset="800475">One Langley at that time the district attorney of Multnomah County, Oregon, which includes the City of Portland, he has been judicially removed from his convict in office, was out to get the petitioner, Elkins, and when I say, was out to get, I rely on record testimony by Langley in this case to the effect that he wanted to get Elkins on a traffic charge and put him away in the state penitentiary for life and that's -- I -- in the footnote on page 49 of petitioners' blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.612" offset="941850">In order to get Elkins, he struck at his employee, the petitioner Clark, and he executed an affidavit on information and belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.344" offset="980720">Now on view of the Jones case just decided, I'd ask Your Honors to look at that affidavit on pages 20 and 21 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.899" offset="1022934">Langley deposed an information and belief that there obscene photographs with accompanying sound recordings in the home of the petitioner, Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.997" offset="1063372">As Your Honors will see, there was no statement of any supporting evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.605" offset="1085837">No statement of any supporting information.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.650" offset="1097958">Langley said he believed that Clark had these articles with intent to exhibit them in violation of the state law and then he went on to say that the source of this information was Police Chief Herder of Saint Helens, Oregon, which is a small community about 25 miles north of Oregon and that was all.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.712" offset="1186252">There was absolutely no statement of supporting facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.352" offset="1204746">Herder, the Chief of Police in Saint Helens, did not know Clark, did not know where Clark lived, had no knowledge of any obscene photographs etcetera in the home of Clark and didn't know anything about Clark except what he had been told by others and Herder also said that he had never communicated with Langley.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.631" offset="1293876">He didn't know the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.713" offset="1298265">He had never conversed with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.433" offset="1309132">As I will show later, there is a question whether Langley without betraying his presence listened in on an extension phone, to a phone call between Herder and a reporter, but nothing turns on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.331" offset="1368691">Langley's position was that since it was information from a police chief, it was therefore probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.636" offset="1401919">At any rate, it was either double or triple hearsay without any statement of supporting facts, but on the strength of that affidavit, Langley got a search warrant from a judge who as he later admitted, didn't read the document too carefully and armed with that search warrant, a raid was made in the evening of the 17th of May, on the home of the petitioner, Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.132" offset="1499930">That raid was conducted by three deputy sheriffs, two policemen in uniform and they were accompanied by two reporters and one newspaper photographer.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.527" offset="1537442">And in the evening of that day, about 8:30 at night, they've broke in the door of the petitioner, Clark's home, and they made return that they found no obscene photographs for the accompanying sound recordings.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.182" offset="1592090">That was the sheriff's return.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.196" offset="1600136">They did seize the five electronic tapes herein question.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.651" offset="1618004">They couldn't tell what those tapes contained, if anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.102" offset="1631796">There were slips accompanying those tapes which the seizing deputy did not read.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.701" offset="1654157">He didn't arrest the petitioner, Clark, for wiretapping which is an offense under Oregon law and indeed, he left these five electronic tapes off the list -- the receipt that he handed Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.708" offset="1706193">He took those tapes that night down to the sheriff's office in the courthouse downtown and in the wee small hours, played them back and made copies of those tapes which were duly published the next paper -- the next morning I should say, in the enterprising paper, whose reporters had accompanied the raid.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.225" offset="1780276">Now, the 17th was a Thursday night.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.486" offset="1793337">The next three days were non-judicial days so that it wasn't until Monday morning that Clark was able to redress this unlawful search, which he did by motion -- by a motion to suppress filed before the very judge who had issued the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.287" offset="1860524">Now, while this motion to suppress was pending in the State District Court which is the lowest tribunal in the Oregon hierarchy, Langley played these tapes to the grand jury, secured an indictment of both petitioners for violation of the state wiretapping act and one of the deputies sheriffs played back part of the tape to an FBI agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.881" offset="1954879">At the end of the hearing on the motion to suppress in the State District Court, the judge who have issued the warrant said that if he'd look at it properly and if he hadn't relied too much on Langley's integrity instead of his inspection, he would never have issued it and ordered the evidence suppressed and ordered it placed in the custody of the State Attorney General, subject to the further orders of the courts and the state -- the tapes were put into a private bank in the actual custody of the Oregon state police.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.348" offset="2092805">A few months later, there arose a question whether the State District Court had jurisdiction to issue the order of suppression after the indictment had been returned the State Circuit Court, which is the court of general criminal jurisdiction in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.496" offset="2161351">The motion to suppress was reargued in the State Circuit Court and the State Circuit Court again, suppressed the evidence as illegally seized and ordered it held by the Attorney General of the State, subject to further orders of the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="567.692" offset="2374092">Yes, because it's the State Circuit Court which is the court of general criminal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.035" offset="2395512">Now, while those tapes were in the bank, they were taken from the bank where they were in the constructive custody of the state courts, they were taken under a federal search warrant and a few months later, the present -- federal indictments followed briefly a number of substantive counts for violation of Section 605 of the Communications Act, the federal wiretapping statute with the inevitable accompaniment of a conspiracy count.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.265" offset="2508466">Petitioners then filed a motion to suppress in the U.S. District Court and they had a four-day hearing on that motion and their grounds were for, first that since the matter had been illegally seized by state officers, it was inadmissible for all purposes in the federal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.675" offset="2598118">Second that the federal agent didn't have probable cause, third that the federal agents and the state officers had cooperated and fourth that the property was in the constructive custody of the state court at the time of seizure and therefore, couldn't be reached by a federal warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.963" offset="2683173">A four-day hearing followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.552" offset="2693622">When Chief Herder finished his testimony in which he made it plain that he knew nothing about the petitioner, Clark, and that he'd never, in his life ever talked to then District Attorney Langley, the U.S. District Court leaned forward and asked the U.S. Attorney, “What is your position on the legality of this state seizure?”</text>
            <text syncTime="669.587" offset="2781706">And the U.S. Attorney trying not to impugn the legality of state officers finally said, “I think that without taking a position on this that for purposes of this matter, that is the motion to suppress, we may treat it as illegal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="689.195" offset="2860178">During and at the close of this four-day hearing on the motion to suppress, the U.S. district judge made three rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.039" offset="2895496">First, he said that the validity of the federal search warrant was immaterial and he cut off further proof on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.181" offset="2924126">Second, he made a finding that there was no federal participation or complicity in the state raid and third, he said that under the silver platter doctrine, which is the Weeks case, plus the buyer's dictum, plus ballistic dictum, it was admissible in a federal prosecution regardless of its original illegality because of the lack of federal participation and he denied the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.036" offset="3027466">Petitioners then went in -- back to the State Circuit Court and got a restraining order, later a preliminary injunction, against the state and county officers enjoining them from testifying in the federal court as to the circumstances of the illegal state seizure in which they had participated and that order was based on the Rea case in the 350 U.S. and the opinion of the State Circuit Court cited and relied on the Rea case.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.464" offset="3149197">When that order was shown, the U.S. district judge who at that point was trying the case, he said it was a nullity under the Supremacy Clause and he ordered the eight enjoined witnesses to testify when they were respectively called.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.268" offset="3216488">Seven of them had been mentioned by name in the state court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.223" offset="3232266">One recognized that he was included within its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.615" offset="3245850">Of those eight, three had been under the restraint before they were subpoenaed by for the federal trial, five were subpoenaed for the trial before the restraining order issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.371" offset="3296841">Also, at the trial, the reels of tape, the five reels of tape were admitted into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.779" offset="3322441">The petitioners preserved their objections, the matter wasn't, of course, reargued, but there was no waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.125" offset="3351907">At the end of a long trial which included night and Saturday sessions, petitioners were convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.889" offset="3378970">Now, following the close of the evidence in their federal trial, they went back into the State Circuit Court and instituted contempt proceedings against the State and county officials who had violated the order of the state court by testifying and the United States Attorney countered with an injunction against petitioners from further pursuing those contempt proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.572" offset="3469667">In due course, the conviction was appealed and the Ninth Circuit affirmed that on the ground of the silver platter doctrine which is the same issue that's also in Rios, No. 52, which follows this case on argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.504" offset="3529435">Now those are the facts in essential outline.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.682" offset="3550124">The first question logically is, was the state search and seizure illegal?</text>
            <text syncTime="867.614" offset="3573844">The United States Attorney conceded at the hearing on the motion to suppress that it was illegal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1094.765" offset="4482382">I think it's perfectly plain that under Oregon law, under the Fourteenth Amendment, under the Fourth Amendment, the Jones case, this was an illegal search and seizure because the affidavit was worthless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.244" offset="4540374">There were no facts stated in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.162" offset="4548002">It was based on probably treble hearsay or if you believe that Langley, the District Attorney in a county of some 400,000 people, didn't communicate directly with the county chief of police, 25 miles away by calling him, but only did so by listening in unbeknownst to the police chief on a call made by a police reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.947" offset="4651133">If Your Honors will believe that, then we're down to only double hearsay, still without any statement of supporting facts and that was an illegal search and an illegal seizure and the people in there were not only trespassers, but since they broke and entered a dwelling house in the night time with intent to take and carry away personal property, then if my memory of criminal common law, crimes doesn't dessert me, they were burglars as well as trespassers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.943" offset="4791150">And since they were not lawfully in the premises, we don't have to go into the question of what they could property have seized which was the point on which the -- Your Honors divided this morning in the Abel case because the basis of Harris and Rabinowitz, of course, is that the people are lawfully on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.851" offset="4866800">These people were not lawfully on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.865" offset="4878817">So we say it was an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of state law, in violation therefore, of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.481" offset="4913298">Now, since there was no federal participation and we don't question those findings, since there was no federal participation, we reach what I deem to be the basic question here and I think ultimately, the only question namely the continued validity of what due to an expression in the Lustig case has been become known as the silver platter doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.815" offset="5026670">Namely, if evidence illegally seized by state officers is handed to federal officers on a silver platter, without any participation on their part, that it is admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.074" offset="5071705">Now, there are at least six reasons in my judgment why that doctrine can stand and why it has no further validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.735" offset="5106291">And the first and I think, basic reason is that the assumption on which it rested has been abandoned by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.910" offset="5142967">Your Honors will recall that in the Weeks case, there were two seizures involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.307" offset="5164596">One was the seizure by federal officers which was ordered suppressed and the other was the seizure by state officers which was not ordered suppressed, because said the Court, the Fourth Amendment doesn't reach these states and therefore, an illegal seizure by state officers at that time, did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, I'm sorry -- they did not violate the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.744" offset="5286327">That was in 1914.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.642" offset="5293955">35 years past, we get to the case of the Wolf against Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.461" offset="5313181">That held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment includes the right to be free from illegal searches and seizures, so that the basis on which the state court seizure in Weeks was rested no longer upholds, because now, an illegal seizure by state officers violates the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.777" offset="5410461">It violates the Federal Constitution and therefore, it is inadmissible in a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.872" offset="5442853">Let me take -- let me take one sentence from the Weeks opinion which I think sets forth its rationale succinctly and clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.008" offset="5483395">The Court there said that if the evidence in question can thus be seized and held and used in evidence against the citizen accused of an offense, the protection of the Fourth Amendment declaring his right to be secure against such searches and seizures is of no value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.068" offset="5555597">And so far as those -- thus placed is concerned, might as well be stricken from the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.434" offset="5581093">Now, let us move on pass 1949 when Wolf v. Colorado has held the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth, incorporates the essential guarantee of the Fourth Amendment, the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures and let me paraphrase what was said in Weeks by changing a single word that if this articles can thus be seized and held and used in evidence against the citizen accused of an offense, the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment declaring his right to be secure against such searches and seizures, is of no value and so far as those thus placed is concerned, might as well be stricken from the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.587" offset="5745768">So that unless the Court is prepared to say that it will protect and enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, less than it's prepared to protect the Fourth, I think it must follow that the state seizure aspect of Weeks is gone --</text>

            <text syncTime="2668.929" offset="10779042">Obviously, that would be bad under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.860" offset="10798791">Let us take a somewhat borderline case, let us take a somewhat borderline case, let us take a case something like Jones, is it bad because it's hearsay or is it bad because they're now supporting facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.776" offset="10842467">And then I think the federal court would have to determine whether admissibility would violate the standards of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.007" offset="10875382">In other words, since this is a federal prosecution, it can't be determined on the basis of state law bearing from the State to State, nor as Mr. Justice Frankfurter says, "Can you have it admissible in the Weeks' jurisdiction -- in a non-Weeks jurisdiction and admissible -- inadmissible in the Weeks jurisdiction -- admissible in the non-Weeks jurisdiction?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.502" offset="10977364">In other words, this concerns the admissibility of evidence in a federal court and that is the federal question on the federal court, is not included by any state determinations, nor by any state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.283" offset="11028459">I mean, if Oregon said that you cannot get a search warrant on any kind of the hearsay, if Oregon for instance, followed the rule of the Grau case, that the only kind of the affidavit must be the -- of the sort of facts that would be admissible on evidence at a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.943" offset="11099094">The federal court might well say, will this might violate Oregon law, but we think it comports with federal standards of due process and therefore we will admit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.156" offset="11139950">Now that basically is our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.734" offset="11150294">There are two other problems which I don't reach for mostly for lack of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.160" offset="11179969">One is the question of the converse of the Rea case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.109" offset="11195852">We only reach that in -- in case that the evidence is admissible and we discuss whether Rea is a doctrine of supremacy or comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.230" offset="11228244">And then the question of the validity of the federal search warrant, that's fully covered in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.474" offset="11257292">Basically, our position is that the district judge was right in saying it was a material because if the evidence was tainted, it couldn't be purified by having another search warrant applied to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3289.422" offset="13261093">First of all, I'd like to outline the position we will take here in argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.487" offset="13289305">As the opposition counsel has done, I shall devote myself primarily to two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.336" offset="13316681">First, being that the state search and seizure was valid under both the Federal Constitution requirements and the state standards and that if it meets the federal constitutional requirements, this should sufficient for admissibility in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.808" offset="13382614">Secondly, that on the facts of this case, on the facts of the Elkins case, this is no case for this Court to adopt a rule of exclusion of evidence, otherwise admissible in federal courts because of the conduct of state officials, law enforcement officers in the obtaining of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.039" offset="13483551">Now, we submit that first of all, this warrant meets to the search and seizure based on the affidavit and the warrant meets federal standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.617" offset="13525870">Also, we suggest, that those standards are virtually equivalent to the standards in Oregon, as petitioner on page 48 of this original brief states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.354" offset="13572786">Now Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked the petitioners' counsel why he did not rest upon Oregon only deciding that the Oregon courts deciding this on Oregon law that that would be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.813" offset="13638614">The petitioner, Mr. Justice, on page 50 of his brief, as I think he stated orally here, has been quite candid in saying that we have no doubt that a federal court would not be concluded by prior state court determination that particular evidence was obtained in violation of state law certainly where the state court had applied an erroneous measure of constitutionality or even more clearly, where operation of the state law would frustrate federal policies or even violate the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.853" offset="13786781">So, we think that petitioner admits that Oregon state law is not determinative of this and if the rule of exclusion must be based entirely on whether or not this search and seizure and the warrant met federal constitutional standards pertaining to the Fourteenth and the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="4179.036" offset="16819493">This is a -- the whole picture is a struggle for -- it's a local hassle and struggle between various law enforcement officers and various people in Oregon which is one excellent reason why the federal prosecutor in the federal court didn't get into this whole thing in the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.114" offset="16887829">Now, on page 26, we have the words of the circuit judge at third full paragraph, “I'm not going to suppress the evidence in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.570" offset="16933700">I am going to turn that over to the Attorney General,” and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4213.056" offset="16955643">Now, Your Honors, neither court suppressed this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.996" offset="16975391">They held it subject to the orders of higher courts for possible future use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.824" offset="16994617">It's true the -- see -- the warrant has held -- declared illegal, but there was no suppression of the evidence and one reason perhaps maybe that Oregon does not have a Weeks rule and so it was undecided until subsequent litigation what should be done with this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.244" offset="17096391">Now this petitioner's case here rests on two pretty fragile supports.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.220" offset="17128260">One is the determination by this local magistrate in Oregon that the -- this affidavit was invalid and the search and seizure was illegal, that's his first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4270.188" offset="17184162">Secondly, is assertion that Oregon has a rule of exclusion along the lines of Weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.789" offset="17210493">Now, throughout his brief and his argument, there are drawn various deductions as to the harmony of state and federal rule preventing conflicts, the logic of applying the same rules, all of which fall with this false premise that Oregon has, which it does not, a Weeks rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.076" offset="17279666">Now, on the first point on the determination of this local magistrate, again, I should like to -- to turn to the record on page 24 and to show that on federal law at least as handed down this morning, this magistrate was clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="4316.154" offset="17367960">In the first paragraph he says, "It is hereby ordered and adjudged that the affidavit in support of the search warrant, shows upon its face that it was based primarily upon information and belief only” and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.722" offset="17430235">Now that, Your Honors, is the reason that the District Court, the local magistrate of the Justice of the Peace level and also the Circuit Court, thought that this whole search and seizure was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.036" offset="17483525">But as the decision in the Jones case holds, certainly that is not the standard in the federal courts because in page 13th of the slip opinion, this Court said, we conclude therefore, the hearsay maybe the basis for a warrant and it goes on to discuss that.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="4364.415" offset="17561057">Mr. Wilkey, it looks to me that the order of the court goes a little farther that you -- you have indicated here because in the fourth -- in the fourth or the third full paragraph, the court says, "It is further ordered and adjudged said search warrant should be and this held be in all affects in nullity and then the article seized under the said search warrant, were improperly so seized and should be suppressed as evidence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4400.541" offset="17705566">Then -- then let me go on please, “Then he goes on to -- to make particular disposition of certain -- certain articles that were taken because of certain special situations and the first one was that of course the slot machines are contraband, it can't be used by anybody, so we destroyed it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.518" offset="17805458">Now, if he did -- if he hasn't suppressed it, hasn't suppressed his inquire why would he have destroyed that?</text>
            <text syncTime="4431.798" offset="17830536">Then secondly, because of this executive order from the Governor the State of Oregon as you say transferring everything to the -- to another officer, they hold that -- that these matters that are under discussion here, shall be turned over to the Attorney General to be -- I see, to be disposed of legally and then the third and last -- last disposition is that anyone who has any copies or recordings of the seized property shall surrender to -- to the sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="4470.984" offset="17987271">Now, that's getting awfully close to a suppression, if isn't a suppression where he says it's no, a nullity and any article seized under the search warrant were -- were improperly so seized should be suppressed as evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="5058.151" offset="20335992">Over on page 412, I simply want to make this point that the state ruling of the State District Court, Judge Maris was purely on the face with the affidavit here, page 412 about seven lines down -- six lines down.</text>
            <text syncTime="5078.770" offset="20418435">I can see no further reason for continuing a hearing of this case because we always will have to go back to the affidavit which is the original, the starting document which I now find under the state law to be faulty.</text>

            <text syncTime="5100.883" offset="20506937">The court, “You can't change this document.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.124" offset="20519894">Mr. Hewlett “It's just as good as gold, Your Honor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.329" offset="20532642">Now, my point there is that at no time in the State District Court or in the Circuit Court once the state prosecutor represented by Langley Lonagan and Hewlett allowed to offer any evidence that the ruling of the District Court was purely on the face of the affidavit that it was invalid because it was hearsay and this Court has said in Jones versus United States today that that at least, is not the federal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5134.343" offset="20640789">And in State versus Hoover, we would argue that information of a reliable sort whether hearsay or not, can be made the basis of an affidavit even in Oregon.</text>
