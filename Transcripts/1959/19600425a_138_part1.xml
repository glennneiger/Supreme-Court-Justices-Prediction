            <text syncTime="215.283" offset="964524">And the reason -- the reason we say that, is that Section 46 (c), we think in terms made Judge Medina from the date of his retirement incompetent to sit in an en banc court as distinguished from a three-judge panel court.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.646" offset="1045922">Now, Section 46 (c) set out on page two of our brief at the bottom provides that cases in controversy shall be heard and determined by court or division of not more than three judges, unless a hearing or rehearing before the court en banc is ordered by a majority of the circuit judges of the circuit who are in active service.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.908" offset="1163055">Now, that latter clause was before the Court in the Western Pacific Railroad case which was here several terms ago and the Court held there that the statute is a grant of power to the Courts of Appeals to sit en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.094" offset="1227734">It does not prescribe any particular procedure which the Courts of Appeals must follow in determining whether a rehearing en banc should be ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.526" offset="1269426">It doesn't require that a petition for rehearing be filed and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.901" offset="1286980">The only limitation so far as the Court of Appeals' power to sit en banc is concern or in determining whether to sit en banc, is that the hearing or rehearing must be ordered by a majority of the circuit judges of the circuit who are in active service.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.656" offset="1353958">And then comes the sentence which we think is dispositive here.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.424" offset="1373080">Finding the composition of the en banc court if it does decide to sit that way, a court en banc shall consist of all active circuit judges of the circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.679" offset="1426056">Now, there's no problem here about Judge Medina's being a circuit judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.864" offset="1442879">There's no problem about his being a Circuit Judge of the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.149" offset="1455940">The keyword there is “active”.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.645" offset="1465971">He was active when the case was submitted to the court en banc, he was retired when the case was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.449" offset="1497213">The statute says cases and controversy shall be heard and determined by a court as defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.225" offset="1524276">The Government's position in a nutshell is that the court en banc must be properly constituted not only at the time the case is heard but at the time it's determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.964" offset="1571192">And that Judge Medina at the time the case was determined by the court en banc was not an active circuit judge of the circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.030" offset="1611525">And for that reason, the judgement entered by that improperly constituted en banc court was invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.768" offset="1678399">But even if -- even if that's -- even if the language heard and determined wasn't specifically on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.773" offset="1710477">We would -- we would not think that would make to -- too much of a difference because after all the function of a court, the one function of a court to which everything else is ancillary is the function to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.094" offset="1755721">That's why a court exists and the crucial action of the Court is the decision and Congress granted the power of the Court of appeals to sit en banc and to decide cases en banc and it entrusted that power only to all active circuit judges of the circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1967.757" offset="7974431">Now, I think the point may perhaps be more clearly illustrated by comparing what was done in this case with another case in which Judge Medina participated just about the same time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1991.538" offset="8069517">Now that case was argued November 8, 1957 before Judge Swan who is retired, Judge Medina and Judge Waterman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.097" offset="8107760">Medina and Waterman, Judges Medina and Waterman were still in active service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.348" offset="8124792">Now on March 1, 1958, Judge Medina retired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.181" offset="8148093">The case was decided the following month April 7, 1958, opinion by Judge Swan, concurred in by Judge Waterman with Judge Medina dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.207" offset="8196159">Now, Judge Medina's participation in a case decided by a three-judge panel after his retirement raises no problem at all under 46 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.457" offset="8237223">46 (c) has nothing to do with three-judge panel decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.859" offset="8250807">And there were some 30 odd cases in which Judge Medina had sat before he retired in which he participated in the decision after his retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.738" offset="8294275">It's not an uncommon situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.485" offset="8305351">There isn't any connection with Judge Magruder and almost every retired circuit judge and the uniform practice throughout the country has been that there's no reason in the world, why a circuit judge who was sat in the case where a three-judge panel can't -- can't proceed to with what the decision notwithstanding his retirement, because a retired judge does not lose the power to participate in that kind of action of the Court of Appeals, simply by reason of his retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.565" offset="8421648">It's 46 (c) that presents the problem and that's limited to the en banc courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.089" offset="8443695">Now, in that Reardon case after the three-judge panel decision in which Judge Medina participated dissenting, petition for rehearing en banc was granted and the -- the -- the order recited that was by vote of the majority of the judges of the circuit in active service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.888" offset="8518928">And so far as we can tell from the reports, every time the Second Circuit grants rehearing en banc, it's by vote of the majority of the judges in active service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.460" offset="8561246">In any event, in that case, rehearing was granted and the en banc court convened and reversed the panel decision, Judges Swan and Medina not participating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.204" offset="8604191">So that in the Second Circuit, as in every circuit, it is clear that where a -- where an en banc hearing is ordered after the retirement, the retired judges don't sit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.140" offset="8659884">And the reason why they don't sit is Section 46 (c) which has been construed and applied since 1948 as meaning that whatever a retired judge can do, retired circuit judge can do after his retirement, and he can do practically everything that he did when he was an active circuit judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.688" offset="8734072">The one thing he can't do after his retirement is sit as a member of the en banc court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.620" offset="8753821">Anymore that when the justice of this Court retires, he cannot participate in the actions, in decisions of this Court even as to cases that were heard and -- before him, cases in which he participated in the conference discussions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.824" offset="8826650">He may even have written a draft opinion, but when the justice of this Court retires, he is through so far as this Court is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.179" offset="8856116">He maybe assigned to the circuit judge -- courts, he can be assigned to the Court of Claims, he can be assigned to the District Court, but he cannot be assigned to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.638" offset="8889971">It's a disqualification which cannot be cured by a designation or assignment and the reason is that there is no statute which authorizes a retired justice of this Court, once he retires to participate as a justice in any decision of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3300.654" offset="13306023">On the first question, Section 43 (b) and Section 46 both went up to give it as one piece of legislation in every draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.275" offset="13356492">Part of Section of 43 (b) had been in Section 120 of the former Judicial Code, Section which is outlined in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.242" offset="13400377">Section 120 of the former Judicial Code provided that the circuit justice and the chief justice of the Supreme Court shall be competent to sit with the court en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.964" offset="13459205">It also provided that a district judge had a limited competency that he could sit with the Court of Appeals only when his presence was necessary to fill out a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.152" offset="13515943">But the new 43 (b) which in the earlier draft is called Section 42 went up together with 46 and they were discussed together at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.945" offset="13559202">Those two sections were bracketed throughout the entire legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="3402.979" offset="13715310">So, they were put in there for that specific purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.200" offset="13836204">I think, this Court in the Western Pacific Railroad Case held that Section 46 was a grant of power, the entire Section, to a Court of Appeals to assign judges has to distribute its work among its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.074" offset="13895659">The Court of Appeals is defined in Section 43 (b), in the first Section, as the active circuit judges of a circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3457.409" offset="13932962">I think that Section 46 said, “Those judges, the active judges of a circuit can assign and distribute the work among any judges competent to sit as members of the Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.848" offset="13982804">However with respect to 46 (c), the section said, “All active judges must be members of the court en banc,” but it did not preclude the active judges of the circuit, the Court of Appeals from assigning other judges to that court as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.520" offset="14065455">Now, I think Judge Medina's situation is different because he was a member of the en banc court and I do not think, he could have been excluded after being a member of the en banc court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.741" offset="14110386">But as I interpret the statute, I would see nothing wrong in a Court of Appeals to break a tie or because they anticipate a tie or because they felt it would be advisable from -- from assigning Judge Hand to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.512" offset="14177468">I don't think they have to because the grant of power is the active judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.953" offset="14195231">They must assign all active judges of the circuit to that court, but I think they have the power under Section 46 to assign any competent judge but they don't have to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3635.670" offset="14646000">And that is precisely I'd like to point out what the Fifth Circuit in Bishop against Bishop did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.439" offset="14673168">There have been a lot cases on this and every one of them is consistent with this theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.360" offset="14688841">In Bishop against Bishop, Judge Magruder who was then an active judge of the First Circuit sat -- had been designated and assigned to the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.746" offset="14742340">He sat on the panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.326" offset="14752684">After the case was decided by the panel, the court en banc, five judges of the Court which were a quorum, as a quorum provision, and the Court consisted of seven so far with quorum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.760" offset="14798451">The court en banc consisting of Judge Magruder and four other judges sat, denied a petition for rehearing en banc and Judge Maris who -- I don't just -- I am not singling him out, but I am mentioning him because the Government's argument is continuously on speculation of what Judge Maris would have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.145" offset="14883924">But Judge Maris was a member of the Court and Judge Magruder did sit with the court en banc in denying a rehearing en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.230" offset="14912240">And if you recall on the Western Pacific Railroad case, this Court said the court could sit en banc to consider the petitions for rehearing en banc or could decide them informally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.384" offset="14952887">Apparently the -- the practice in the Third Circuit is for the Court to sit in en banc and that's precisely what happened.</text>
