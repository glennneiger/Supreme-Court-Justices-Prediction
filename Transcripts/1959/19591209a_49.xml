            <text syncTime="39.582" offset="261726">This case was heard below by a three-judge District Court on the motion of the defendants to dismiss the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.636" offset="309896">The Court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint for alleged want of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.010" offset="351378">The Court held that the record fails to show the existence of a justiciable controversy between the parties within the meaning, scope of the judicial power conferred on the federal courts by the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.103" offset="439777">The appellants are Florida corporations engaged in the interstate marketing of avocados grown in the southern part of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.625" offset="497873">They complained that their marketing operations are restricted and handicapped by application of a statute of California prohibiting sale in that State of avocados of less than 8% oil content regardless of quality or maturity by any other standards and that the California statute, as applied to their marketing of avocados, is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.129" offset="663907">The appellants invoked three provisions of the Constitution, the Commerce Clause, because the challenged state statute is an unwarranted, impermissible interference with interstate commerce, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because application of the statute to appellants' avocados results in arbitrary discrimination against appellants in favor of the growers and handlers of avocados grown in California and the Supremacy Clause, because appellants' avocados are marketed under federal regulation and in compliance with the standards of quality and maturity thereby imposed, that is, the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 and the program adopted thereunder by the Secretary of Agriculture, with specific relation to the avocados grown in South Florida and because application of the California statute to these avocados overrides and defeats the policy and program of the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.279" offset="1280502">It has to do with the fixing of the time for picking of the avocados in coordination with the attainment of certain size and weight at a given date when the picking is permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.300" offset="1356570">That has been the practice under this program since it was adopted June 11, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.952" offset="1387186">And I -- I say again, Your Honor, in this instance, that is the -- almost the entire purpose of the program because it was adopted for the reason that there was no satisfactory standard in effect in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.163" offset="1456044">But since 1954, there has been a standard, as I have stated, and it does not include oil content because as we set forth, oil content is not valid scientifically as a test of maturity of the Florida avocados.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.331" offset="1560743">Our first task to the jurisdiction of this Court granted that the record discloses the existence of a justiciable controversy within the judicial power of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.517" offset="1625422">Hearing by a three-judge court was mandatory because the complaint seeks a declaratory judgment and injunction restraining further enforcement against appellants by the officers of California of the statute of that State upon the ground of constitutionality at 28 U.S.C. 2281.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.894" offset="1742973">The judge of the District Court, upon consideration of the complaint, convened a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.781" offset="1782471">The Court heard and determined the matter in the manner that I have stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.403" offset="1804936">The case thus heard and determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.839" offset="1818728">Judicial -- the Judicial Code provides for direct appeal to this Court as a matter of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.263" offset="1852374">No question was raised in the District Court about the propriety of a hearing by a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.963" offset="1879228">This Court, however, appellee Jacobsen, I'm going to say incidentally, Your Honor, somewhere between the filing of motion to dismiss and the filing of this brief we've lost two of the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.528" offset="1941504">And the motion to dismiss was made by three appellees but the brief is by the appellee Jacobsen.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.417" offset="1965014">And he argues that the hearing in the District Court should have been held by a single judge only instead of a three-judge court convened pursuant to Section 2281.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.029" offset="2015483">Therefore, there is no right of appeal under Section 1253.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.527" offset="2037530">The reason stated for this contention is that the complaint questions, the validity of the state statute, as applied to appellants, not only under the Commerce Clause and the Equal Protection Provision of the Constitution but also on the ground of a conflict with an Act of Congress regulating interstate commerce and a marketing agreement in effect thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.778" offset="2154454">This is said not to constitute a claim of unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.256" offset="2172426">And it is urged that because of the inclusion of this claim, the appeal should have gone to the Court of Appeals instead of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.020" offset="2219447">Your Honors, the appellants do not dispute the proposition that if a case does not call for a hearing by a three-judge District Court under 28 U.S.C. 2281 and even if it is heard by such a court, there is no right of direct appeal to this Court under Section 1253.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.755" offset="2318399">Therefore, the decisions to this effect cited in appellees' brief are passed without comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.322" offset="2352671">Only three of the cases referred to by appellees say anything about a conflict between a state law and an Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.369" offset="2388825">Lemke versus Farmers Grain Company, 258 U.S., and In re Buder, 271 U.S. and Parker versus Brown, 317 U.S. Lemke versus Farmers Grain Company was heard by a single District Judge and the appeal in the first instance went to the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.027" offset="2499480">The complaint in that case was two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.348" offset="2512750">That the North Dakota Grain Grading and Inspection Act of 1919 violated the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, also that it was in conflict with the Federal Grain Standards Act of 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.865" offset="2578787">The question was whether the Court of Appeals properly exercised jurisdiction on the appeal from the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.141" offset="2619956">And this Court held that in one phase of the case, the constitutionality of the state statute was not involved, only consideration and construction of both the state and federal statutes and their applications to the fact is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.069" offset="2707623">In the companion case of Lemke versus Homer Farmers Elevator Co., 258 U.S. 65 on a complaint of exactly the same kind, a three-judge District Court granted an injunction restraining the enforcement of the state statute and on direct appeal to this Court, the judgment of the District Court was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.020" offset="2831444">In re Buder came to this Court on application for mandamus to direct the District Judge who heard the case to allow a direct appeal to this Court as was the practice then in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.209" offset="2912214">The litigation arose from a tax levied against the National Bank and its stockholders under a Missouri statute, the constitutional validity of which was not questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.184" offset="2972087">However, in -- in 1923, Congress made a new enactment relating to the power of the States to tax national banks and prescribed choice of one of three methods for such taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.907" offset="3050977">The bank contented that the State was required to make an election by a new legislation of one of the three permissible methods to tax national banks and had as yet failed to take such action.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.287" offset="3116492">And that meanwhile, the state law under which the challenged tax levy was made had become inoperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.959" offset="3155257">Thus, the issue was whether or not the state law was still enforced, not a question of constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.166" offset="3188067">Accordingly, a leave to file the petition for mandamus was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.006" offset="3211368">Reference to In re Buder was made in the opinion in Query versus United States, 316 U.S. 486.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.693" offset="3262151">An action by the United States against the South Carolina Tax Commission to enjoin enforcement of a state statute imposing a license tax for the privilege of selling certain articles as attempted to be applied to the sale of such articles as the United States Army -- Army and Post Exchanges located in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.867" offset="3366849">A three-judge District Court granted an injunction, but decided also that the case was properly one for a single judge whereupon the appeal of the tax officers was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals which affirmed the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.312" offset="3444590">Certiorari was granted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.925" offset="3459114">The judgment was vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.212" offset="3472175">And the cause was remanded to the District Court to enter a new judgment from which a direct appeal could be taken to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.209" offset="3508224">Quoting from the Court's opinion, "If no more than a question of construction of a federal statute had been involved," referring to the Act of Congress giving consent for imposition of certain kinds of state taxes within federal areas, "there would have been no necessity for a three-judge court pursuant to Section 266," citing In re Buder.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.427" offset="3625044">The Court went on to say that the complaint was of unconstitutionality of the state law as applied to complainant and that the relief order was predicated upon the same ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.242" offset="3680319">That the unconstitutionality arose from interference with an activity of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.175" offset="3708113">That the relief purported an injunction against enforcement of a state statute on the ground of unconstitutionality could only have been properly granted by a three-judge District Court, and that appeal did not lie to the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.817" offset="3790660">Regulation of the marketing of Florida avocados is now an activity of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.699" offset="3830157">And a state statute interfering with that activity is unconstitutional by virtue of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.394" offset="3884910">At page 23 of appellants' brief, in a long footnote, it is observed that in Parker versus Brown, 317 U.S. 341, the constitutionality of the California Agricultural Prorate Law enacted in 1933 --</text>

            <text syncTime="1020.603" offset="4185736">That's the jurisdictional situation in that case and the present case is precisely the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="1110.184" offset="4544136">In their briefs and on the oral argument, counsel for the parties are requested to discuss the questions whether the state statute involved is rendered invalid by the action of Congress in passing the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Agricultural Adjustment Act as amended or any other Act of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.361" offset="4728769">We may assume also that a stabilization program adopted under the Agricultural Act would supersede the State Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.201" offset="4776208">But the Federal Act becomes effective only if a program is ordered by the Secretary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2009.579" offset="8141720">It wasn't a question of how this regulation would work in practice although some of the judges of this Court thought that they ought to wait and see how it would work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.268" offset="8196472">But the -- the essence of the opinion was that the very existence of that statute was under the terms with the Government's operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.025" offset="8239522">That's what we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.295" offset="8248508">There is no room for a construction hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.726" offset="8318307">If there are no further questions on the subject of this Court's jurisdiction of the appeal, I take the interrelated questions which frankly I assume for the reason or the form of the order in this case and if there's not a justiciable controversy, there's none for any court or in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.813" offset="8426663">So I come to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.804" offset="8438575">Now the decision of the District Court that there's no present controversy turns on, on one fact that in past instances, when avocados shipped by appellants to California have been barred from sale in that State because it failed to pass the 8% oil test, appellants have availed themselves of leave to reship the avocados to some other State instead of submitting them to destruction as a public nuisance in the manner provided by Section 785 of the Agricultural Code of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.017" offset="8635434">According to the opinion of the District Court, only in an abatement proceeding under Section 785 could a threatened justiciable controversy arise with respect to a shipment of California -- to California of Florida avocados of less than 8% oil content.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.552" offset="8725608">Somehow, the question of constitutionality of California's 8% oil content law an application to Florida-grown avocados would have to erase and passed upon in the state court proceeding the kind provided in Section 785 for abatement of perishable fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.764" offset="8830412">There are two short answers to the holding of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.198" offset="8856116">First that the proceeding provided by Section 785 relates only to conformity or nonconformity of the fruit or other products granted as a public business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.738" offset="8926333">And second, if an issue of constitutionality of the standardization provision would be raised in such a summary proceeding, it would be a judicial issue and not an administrative issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.076" offset="8995715">And the result of the District Court's ruling would be to compel the appellants to try such judicial issue in a state court notwithstanding the Act of Congress granting recourse to a federal court for trial of such issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.785" offset="9070529">On the facts alleged in appellants' complaint, now followed by evidentiary matter and depositions and in answers to interrogatories and on the decisions of this Court cited in division two of appellants' brief, it is submitted that the decision of the District Court is erroneous and that there exists a present and substantial controversy between the parties regarding the constitutional validity of California's 8% oil content requirement as applied to the Florida avocados handled by appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.786" offset="9234474">In appellees' brief at page 12, it is said, "Appellants make no claim of personal wrongdoing against appellee regarding past shipments to California and these transactions are closed."</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.226" offset="9312319">If this means that appellants are not suing the Director of Agriculture for damages in this action, that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.143" offset="9367907">But there is indeed a claim of personal wrongdoing against appellee regarding the past shipment of appellees' avocados to California apart from sale in that State by appellee and its subordinates, that because of the utility of a legal remedy for such a wrongdoing, appellants are seeking equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.663" offset="9466023">And at page 12 of appellees' brief, it has said also that appellants have not in any time violated the California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.462" offset="9509177">The -- the standardization provision of the California Code relating to avocados is Section 792, which is page 6 of the appendix to appellants' brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.901" offset="9566960">One of the enforcement provisions is Section 784.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.513" offset="9577409">This Section states what acts are unlawful if the fruit or other product is nonconforming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.719" offset="9622235">There are 10 verbs in Section 784 specifying the acts prohibited with respect to nonconforming products, namely, to prepare, pack, place, deliver for shipment, deliver for sale, load, ship, transport, cost to be transported for sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="2741.329" offset="11068688">In appellees' brief at page 27, it has said, “The plaintiff in Evers versus Dwyer, a Negro, immediately violated the Memphis segregation ordinance at the moment he seated himself in the front portion of the public bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.675" offset="11146115">At this point, the justiciable controversy came into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.706" offset="11170147">The facts which were formed the basis of the litigation were fixed and would never be more concrete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.682" offset="11210062">If the plaintiff had been arrested, put to trial for a violation of an ordinance or statute, there might have been an issue as to the precise act by which the offense was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.244" offset="11272338">But the controversy with which this Court was concerned was not that of guilt or innocence of the bus passenger in the particular occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.856" offset="11318836">The matter with which this Court was concerned was the constitutional validity of the Tennessee statute requiring segregated seating arrangements according to race in public buses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.685" offset="11382157">In the incident that prompted the plaintiff to file his action for declaratory judgment and injunction in the federal court, the facts noted were that when plaintiff seated himself at the front of the vehicle, the driver told him to move to the rear and that this was required by law because of his color.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.600" offset="11481736">And that following the plaintiff's refusal to comply, two police officers boarded the bus and ordered the plaintiff to go to the back of bus or get off or be arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.994" offset="11547355">And that thereupon, the plaintiff left the bus.What gave rise to the justiciable controversy regarding the constitutionality of the Tennessee statute was not simply the fact that the plaintiff sat down in the front part of the bus, but that the driver of the bus and the police officers clearly manifested the intention of the persons in charge with the bus to enforce the State's segregation statute in a manner denying to plaintiff and the class of persons in whose behalf he sued use of the public buses without discrimination and humiliation because of racial origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.013" offset="11731466">The crux of the Court's holding is in this sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.511" offset="11749439">A resident of a municipality who cannot use transportation facilities therein without being subjected by statute to special disabilities necessarily has, we think, a substantial, immediate and real interest in the validity of the statute which imposes the disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.391" offset="11836897">Fundamental principle, the jurisdictional situation, the case at bar is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.905" offset="11863019">Appellants who are engaged in nationwide marketing of Florida avocados, under the agents of the Federal Constitution, complained that they are subjected to commercial handicap and discrimination by a California statute barring sale in that State of avocados with less than 8% oil content.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.668" offset="11946088">And it is submitted no sacrificial offering of a load of avocados is needed to prove that appellee and his subordinates have for years enforced California's oil content requirement against avocados coming from Florida and will continue to enforce this requirement so long as the statute remains in force, unless stayed by declaration or writ of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.544" offset="12065520">In this case, in contrast with Public Commission of Utah versus Wycoff Company, 344 U.S., there is absolute certainty of the matter in which the challenged state regulation applies to the marketing of Florida avocados.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.285" offset="12132498">The prohibition against sale in California of avocados with less than oil -- 8% oil content is unqualified and without exception regardless of place of origin, quality, maturity or federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.167" offset="12199999">There is contrast in this respect between the avocado section of the California code and other sections of the same code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.212" offset="12236257">For example, the standardization provisions relating to containers of fruits, nuts and vegetables are expressly declared inapplicable to shipments from outside the State in containers established as standard by the applicable laws or regulations of the United States at Section 788.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.298" offset="12328521">The standardization provisions says as to apples, it was revised in 1957, are declared inapplicable to apples shipped into California from other States if accompanied by an official certificate stating that such apples have met the maturity requirements of the state of origin, Section 827.7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.039" offset="12419532">Other standardization provisions of the Code give effect to inherent differences between varieties of the fruit are -- are differences arising from growing conditions, different regions of the State making one standard for this geographical division as a different standard for the other geographically division.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.568" offset="12497690">Also some of the standards allow a 5% or 10% tolerance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.056" offset="12515558">The 8% oil requirement for avocados is quite unique and it start rigidity thus emphasizing the arbitrary disregard of applicable horticultural factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.071" offset="12587656">I shall respond to one other point in appellees' brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.690" offset="12610121">It's argued aside from the question whether or not there is a justiciable controversy, I hope the Court will not have much trouble with that word as I have many, that appellants have not shown danger of great and irreparable injury, therefore, are not entitled to the equitable relief right in their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.381" offset="12700923">I quote from page 33 of the appellees' brief, “It is significant that appellants have never applied for interlocutory relief during the two years that have elapsed since they filed their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.487" offset="12757347">This a further indication that appellants are not suffering the kind of immediate injury which will prompt a federal court to exercise its equitable powers in the suit to enjoin public officers from the enforcement of the state law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.072" offset="12823698">The appellants' complaint was filed November 13, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.317" offset="12840626">And actually, the complaint was filed by the defendants on December 6, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.759" offset="12862360">Depositions of various witnesses accounting for 335 pages of the printed record were taken in Miami, Florida January 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.133" offset="12907917">Interrogatories were served by both the plaintiffs and the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.284" offset="12924531">On February 24, 1958, appellants filed a motion appearing on page 29 of the record requesting the Court to set the action for trial at the early convenience of the Court and stating the reasons for this request.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.315" offset="13000600">Paragraphs 5 and 6 of this motion showed that all depositions intended to be taken have been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.761" offset="13030379">And that other discovery procedure could be completed within a time limited by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.572" offset="13057651">Paragraph 4, I quote, “The next marketing season for the avocados handled by plaintiffs commences about July 1, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.096" offset="13099760">Therefore, the action is of emergency nature.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.912" offset="13115016">And then the concluding paragraph, number 7, “This request to set the action for trial is made in lieu of an application by plaintiffs for an interlocutory injunction since the hearing of such application may be obviated by plenary trial of the action and entry of a final decree.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.482" offset="13201324">This motion was still pending April 18, 1958 when the three-judge court first came into session.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.210" offset="13232253">There was then also pending the motion of the defendants to dismiss the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.149" offset="13252002">The latter motion was heard and taken under advice consequently the motion to set the case for early trial received no attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.744" offset="13286379">Eight months passed before the Court announced the ruling which accounts for this appeal, eight months during which the appellants could do nothing further in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.520" offset="13337475">The further statement on page 33 of appellees' brief is quite ironic, that if a justiciable controversy exist, appellants could have sought declaratory relief in the Superior Court of the State of California and that under this remedy, appellants would be entitled to an expeditious hearing of their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.875" offset="13434859">The implication seems to be that speedier justice is obtainable in the Superior Court of California and in the District Court of United States for the Northern District of California.Be that as it may, I submit to Your Honors that the appellants have not been lacking in diligence in seeking the equitable relief for which they pray in their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.390" offset="13548962">I submit also that there is a point in showing that the record of this case without need of an added sacrifice, that appellants at the present continuing in substantial interest in the question of the validity of the California statute of which they complained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.643" offset="13621896">Thank you, Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3390.408" offset="13665050">This case involves an exotic fruit, avocado.</text>

            <text syncTime="3405.722" offset="13726281">I should like to briefly describe what the case is about and what the contentions are of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.899" offset="13755016">Avocados are a fruit which you use for food.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.502" offset="13769331">Avocados are grown both in Florida and California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.269" offset="13784482">They're utilized by the housewife mainly in green salads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.681" offset="13802141">The housewife purchased an avocado in the store when it's hard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.740" offset="13818337">In room temperature at home, it softens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.609" offset="13829831">It is very difficult for the housewife to tell of the maturity of the avocado from the time she buys it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.182" offset="13856057">The avocado is hard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.994" offset="13863372">Touch does not indicate maturity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.586" offset="13873716">Appearance does not indicate maturity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.446" offset="13889181">The oil content of an avocado increases as the avocado matures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.139" offset="13919901">California, since 1925, has required that all avocados sold in the State contain a minimum of 8% oil content.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.538" offset="13973504">The purpose is to protect the consumer of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.425" offset="13993044">The device of ensuring a minimum oil content is a guarantee of maturity, we believe, is a reasonable device to ensure that protection.</text>
