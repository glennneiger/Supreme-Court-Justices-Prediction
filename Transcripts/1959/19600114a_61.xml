            <text syncTime="16.923" offset="171029">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.579" offset="185657">This case here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit brings before this Court for the first time since the enactment of the Robinson-Patman Act in 1936, the meaning of Section 2 (c) of that Act, the so-called, “brokerage section.”</text>
            <text syncTime="38.765" offset="258382">Generally speaking, that section makes it unlawful for any person to pay or grant any brokerage or any allowance or discount in lieu thereof, to the other party to a purchase and sales transaction except for services rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.534" offset="325465">The two questions which are presented by this case are first, whether the prohibitions of this provision apply to a seller's broker who engages in conduct otherwise prohibited by the Act, that is a seller's broker as distinguished from the seller himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.976" offset="395264">And the second question presented is whether the particular conduct engaged in by the respondent in this case involve a grant or allowance in lieu of brokerage within the meaning of those provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.472" offset="449285">The basic facts in the case are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.534" offset="461511">They were found by the examiner, accepted by the Commission and the Court of Appeals itself in setting aside the Commission's order, accepted those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.814" offset="502680">The respondent, Henry Broch &amp; Company, is a broker engaged in selling food products for roughly 25 principals.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.438" offset="545102">He is compensated on the basis of a percentage of the sales made and the amount he receives may vary from particular seller to particular seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.468" offset="593272">This particular case grows out of sales which the respondent made on behalf of a Canadian processor of apple concentrate, a firm called, Canada Foods.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.190" offset="644159">And they involved the sale of the apple concentrate that was processed in 1954 to affirm in the United States called Smucker.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.068" offset="691597">In the spring of 1954, Canada Foods appointed Broch as its broker and at that time, entered into an understanding that Broch would be paid 5% as a commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.012" offset="763382">Thereafter, the -- Canada Foods entered into agreements with other brokers to represent it and in those instances, they agreed to pay the brokers 4%, the explanation being that the Broch firm stored the goods in advance.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="183.901" offset="838928">In October of 1954, Canada Foods announced to its brokers that the 1954 pack of apple concentrate would be ready shortly and sent samples out and indicated that the price on this concentrate would be made available.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.366" offset="916877">And around the 11th or 13th of October, they sent out an announcement to the trade brokers, the price would be $1.30 per gallon in 50-gallon drums.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.075" offset="967659">Promptly upon receipt of this information, another broker who was getting 4% on the sales, a firm called Kenser &amp; Phipps got in touch with the Smucker firm and suggested they might interested in this concentrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.606" offset="1029831">There was good deal of discussion back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.531" offset="1041533">The upshot of it was that the Smucker firm indicated they would be interested in taking 500 barrels.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.320" offset="1068701">Now, this is concededly a very large order, because each barrel contains 50 gallons, so the result of this is approximately 25,000 gallons at the price of $1.30, is better than a $30,000 order.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.440" offset="1129096">But they further indicated to Mr. Phipps that they didn't want to pay that much money and Mr. Phipps said he would get in touch with Canada Foods and see what he could do about it and there was further discussions back and forth between Canada Foods and Phipps and Canada Foods said, “No, they wouldn't cut the price.”</text>
            <text syncTime="274.925" offset="1203075">At this point on, the 26th day of October, Smucker made a specific offer to Phipps.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.777" offset="1234526">They said they would buy 500 barrels of their stuff at $1.25.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.947" offset="1263156">Phipps promptly wired this offer to the Canadian seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.525" offset="1277471">The next morning, the Canadian seller called Phipps and advised Phipps that they would not sell for less than $1.30 and went on and stated the only way we could do something about it, would be if the brokerage was cut.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.595" offset="1337762">Phipps had no inclination to do this and that was the end of matter insofar as those negotiations were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.348" offset="1368795">Now, the respondent, Henry Broch &amp; Company, entered the picture, a couple days before these last events, when it too, attempted to sell this concentrate to Smucker.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.017" offset="1415398">It got in -- its representative got in touch with the Smucker man telling he was interested in it and the Smucker man said that they already had an offer to buy this concentrate at $1.30, but they wanted to do something better.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.650" offset="1474017">Smucker told them they were interested in this large order of 500 barrels and Mr. Broch indicated he would see what he could do about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.418" offset="1509021">He then sent a telegram -- he -- I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.396" offset="1525008">He called Canada Foods and indicated that he could sell 500 barrels at $1.25.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.906" offset="1554996">The Canada Foods man said he'd sharpen his pencil.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.994" offset="1567326">The next morning he called him back and said, “All right, you can get this order at $1.25, but your brokerage will have to be 3%” and this was accepted by Mr. Broch and the sale was consummated at $1.25.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.407" offset="1653008">The $1.25 price was given by Canada Foods to this one seller throughout 1954 and 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.973" offset="1699297">At the same time, Broch sold this product to 18 other customers at the regular price of $1.30 and on the sales to the 18 other customers they received their regular commission of 5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.224" offset="1760319">Similarly the three other brokers who represented Canada Foods during this period also sold at $1.30 and received their regular agreement price of 4%.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.589" offset="1813713">So that was only on sales to this particular purchaser, Smucker, that the lower price and the lower brokerage were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.667" offset="1850075">And I want to emphasize that there's no question that this was a very large purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.443" offset="1869093">In fact, the manager of Canada Foods, when he was conducting his negotiations with Broch about appointing the broker said, he didn't think anyone in this country to take more than 250 barrels of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.364" offset="1928861">The Commission held, on these facts, first that the statute -- its prohibitions do apply to the seller's broker, not just to the seller and secondly, that Broch, by giving up a part of the brokerage, to which it was entitled under its agreement with Canada Foods, in order to make possible the giving of a lower price to this particular buyer, had given an allowance or discount in lieu of brokerage in violation of Section 2 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="487.492" offset="2053308">The Court of Appeals set aside the Commission's order on two distinct grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.840" offset="2074728">First, it said that Section 2 (c) does not apply to seller's brokers and secondly, it said, “In any event, Broch did not directly or indirectly pay anything to Smucker.”</text>
            <text syncTime="507.282" offset="2132511">We believe that both of these rulings of the court below are erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.457" offset="2161246">Now, in construing Section 2 (c), we have to look to the basic purpose of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.955" offset="2199176">And as we have detailed in our reply brief and as this Court has indicated in the Simplicity case to think the basic purpose and also I might refer to the Morton Salt case, the basic purpose of the Robinson-Patman Act was to make sure that large purchases did not get a competitive advantage in purchasing over the smaller people, solely because of the fact that they had this mass-buying power.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.403" offset="2312965">The original Clayton Act in 1914 had suffered from a serious deficiency that it only dealt with actual price discriminations.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.797" offset="2350582">And as this Court detailed last term in the Simplicity case, the large buyers were able to find other methods by which they could obtain the same kind of preferences and one of the most prevalent devices involved was that of brokerage.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.543" offset="2429576">Now, the legislative history indicates that the concern of Congress in the brokerage clause, the problems that were presented to it was things known as bogus brokerage, the situation in which the seller either set up a dummy corporation or appointed a clerk in his office and said he is my broker pay him the brokerage.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.168" offset="2512018">That is we -- we concede that is the basic problem that was called to the intention of Congress in dealing with brokerage.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.457" offset="2545246">But --</text>

            <text syncTime="1264.091" offset="5159685">Now, the statute insofar as the first question of whether it applies to the sellers' broker and not just to the seller, and broadly would seem to cover it, at least, on the face of it which is -- it says, “Any person engaged in commerce,” this is page 2 of our brief, “makes it unlawful for any person to pay or grant, anything of value at the commission, brokerage or any allowance or discount in lieu thereof, to the other party to a purchase and sales transaction.”</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="2162.002" offset="8751417">Now, of course, when he said this was open, this wasn't open in the sense that anybody knew about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.820" offset="8778689">When this kind of favoritism takes place, it's not generally announced and in fact, after the buyer, the competing broker Phipps discovered what it happened when he found out that his sale had been lost to other broker, he wrote to the seller and asked him whether he said he was very surprised with this and he said he hoped that all the other brokers were getting the same price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.563" offset="8877641">And they weren't being treated on more favorably and at this point, the seller justified that the he didn't answer this, but Phipps subsequently testified that in a later phone conversation with the broker he asked the broke -- the seller rather, Phipps asked the seller whether in fact the price was still $1.30, if anyone would get less and this man said, “No, everyone's paying $1.30.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.073" offset="8983698">Now, finally, I want to discuss the arguments strongly pressed here by the respondent and relied on by a Court of Appeals which is that -- they said that -- and they argue here that this construction of the statute by the Federal Trade Commission contravenes what they call broad general national antitrust objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.784" offset="9090487">The argument is that this has the effect of freezing brokerage commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.446" offset="9109191">That since you can't adjust them down and wouldn't pass it on, this is directly contrary to the basic premise of the Sherman Act, favoring free and vigorous competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.125" offset="9159868">The answer, we think, to that is basically a simple one which is that while there's this general policy of favoring vigorous competition, nonetheless, Congress has made the determination that there is certain types of competition that in the long run will harm rather than further the competitive system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.931" offset="9259133">Types and practices which result in the large buyer being able to get a competitive advantage over the smaller one, and thus we think that what Congress has done in this statute is to say that there's an exception to the general policy of competition, the exception is that there are certain types, certain specific practices which must be proscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.657" offset="9338023">And one of those practices is the passing on of brokerage directly or indirectly, we think, the passing of brokerage to the buyer, to the large buyer in this situation where the buyer is able to get this benefit not accorded to the others, not as the result of any superior efficiency of its own operation, but solely as the result of his superior purchasing power.</text>

            <text syncTime="2354.132" offset="9519940">I wish to express my appreciation to this Court and to the Solicitor General and to my colleague, Mr. Friedman, for these 10 minutes to address you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.690" offset="9562154">The burden of my argument here this afternoon is to examine the practical competitive effects of the decision below within the framework of the structure and the marketing practices in food distribution and to deal here with practical results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.767" offset="9642402">I'm representing here, Your Honors, the independent operators of supermarkets and food stores across this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.788" offset="9678555">The membership of this association is composed of local and community food store operators who operate small stores, supermarkets, superettes of all kinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.135" offset="9727875">Some of them operate more than one store, but all are community business people and they buy their merchandise through voluntary groups, through cooperative groups or retailers affiliated together to get cost-efficiency, so they can buy merchandise on a plane of relative equality with the large chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.374" offset="9796838">Some of our members also buy through independent wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.293" offset="9808541">Some of them buy through -- with manufacturer direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.373" offset="9820871">So, what I'm doing here is really representing the broad group of independent retailers as we known to be today whether they operate supermarket or one or two stores, they're ultimately business people.</text>

            <text syncTime="2444.463" offset="9881266">Yes, Mr. Justice, a great many of our people -- the majority of our members are members of what is called the voluntary buying group or cooperative buying group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.988" offset="9915329">And that, of course, resulted because there's a retailers affiliate together and they're buying and they're purchasing that makes it possible for them to buy merchandise on a -- on a better basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2472.326" offset="9992652">I might say that the largest buying group in the country today, Your Honor, sells to its 1446 members, wholesale $300,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.711" offset="10038209">Whereas, the largest chain -- largest food chain in United States, they sell at retail $5 billion and has some 4777 stores and operates in 37 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.053" offset="10083558">So there's no comparison between the purchasing power of the buying groups through which independent purchaser merchandise and the large corporate chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.602" offset="10125772">The retailers that we represent here, Your Honor, are buyers and they are interested as much as anyone else in purchasing their merchandise at the lowest possible cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.135" offset="10179897">And if we thought that the price reduction that's taken place in this case, would come to the independent merchants and they would share on some basis of equality with the large chain, we wouldn't be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.252" offset="10240397">But we know, we know from history and we know from experience that the price cut that we're talking about here today, went by the facts of this case, to the one tremendously large buyer of apple concentrate, 500 barrels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.902" offset="10306957">And the burden of our argument today is simply this that if there's to be a price cut which is going to be made on the basis that all the customers of this supplier going to share and it -- and so they can all compete with each other on some plane of equality at the retail level, we want it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.086" offset="10387728">But if this is to be a price concession given to a favored mass buyer by reason only of his mass purchasing power and not by reason of his efficiency, then we know that the community store operators, the community supermarket operators are going to be placed at very severe competitive disadvantage.</text>

            <text syncTime="2934.072" offset="11839613">In the statute, there is a section governing the receipt of price variations by buyers, Section 2 (f) which was before this Court in the Automatic Canteen case 2 (f), yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.552" offset="11881618">And once again, just in the case of a suit against the buyer for paying a lower price if a suit had been brought against the seller for receiving a lower price, it would have been perfectly obvious that there would have been no violation whatsoever of the statute, because the open price reduction here at bar, had all the earmarks of legality, if tested by the standards of these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.306" offset="11964583">Namely, it is clear in the record that there were significant cost economies to the seller in making this transaction and in making this sale, because as he testified and there's no contradiction of that in the record, they were savings in freight, savings in processing, savings in customs and saving in the brokerage commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="2986.547" offset="12049533">They are available under 2 (f), because under the law of 2 (f), it requires an illegal transaction by the seller to the buyer to also charge the buyer with the legality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.068" offset="12095613">I believe that there was also a suggestion that the price, the lower price given to the buyer could not have been cost justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.226" offset="12136260">I don't know whether there was any further explanation of why not, but certainly the theory that a price reduction could not be cost justified by reference to savings and brokerage commissions would read out of the Act the express proviso whereby Congress guaranteed that the economies of distribution could be reflected on lower prices to the consumer and there was no exception for these economies insofar as brokerage commissions were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.968" offset="12239287">As a matter of fact, there was a proposal to that effect addressed to Congress in 1936 at the time the Act was passed, there was a proposal before the Committee to accept from the permissible cost savings, those costs attributable to broker's fees and that provision was stricken from the statute in conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.510" offset="12317445">I have in our brief the explanation for the action by Senator Logan who was the Chairman of the Subcommittee considering the bill and who was the Senate Manager of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.650" offset="12361958">Senator Logan explained to the Senate at that time, in the second section of this Committee amendment of the provision that in making the -- a discrimination or differentials or whatever who may choose to call them, all costs other than brokerage shall be allowed and it has been said that the words, “other than brokerage,” in that section ought to go out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.602" offset="12437817">I have thought a good deal about that suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.142" offset="12447953">I think that perhaps legitimate brokerage ought to be allowed as a part of the costs and I think when the bill was drafted, I did not write the bill, perhaps in the amendment which was inserted by the Committee we had in mind dummy brokerage, sham brokerage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.818" offset="12498631">In other words, this provision was stricken out by the Conference Committee and we believe completely deflates the suggestion which has been tendered here that a seller's price reduction for some reason unexplained in the statute and perhaps referenced to the basic policy rather than a text, may not be justified by reference to cost economies just as any other economies of distribution when a seller makes a price to a buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.883" offset="12606882">What we have in this case Your Honors is in effect, an unprecedented issue of statutory interpretation whereby the Commission would, in effect, render illegal a competitive price reduction which would be cost justified and lawful under Section 2 (a), if it had been proceeded against, as it should have been properly, against the parties to the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.944" offset="12703117">And it has done this by invoking this novel theory whereby a seller's broker is charged with making an illegal rebate by accepting a lower commission and then this lower commission then somehow gets on over to the buyer through the instrumentality of the lower price by the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.328" offset="12772707">We believe this is the first case in which this theory has been urged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.901" offset="12790993">We believe this theory has no relationship to the text of the statute, to the congressional purpose as expressed in the legislative reports as we have it and also to the policy of the Robinson-Patman Act which has been adverted to -- by counsel for the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3263.416" offset="13157021">If there had been in truth and fact, in this case, which there was not, an actual taking of money by the broker out of his pocket and paying it over to the buyer who obviously in such a situation would be in connivance with the broker, we say that the broker in such a situation could be charged with having accepted -- having accepted money from the seller on behalf of the other side of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.001" offset="13255346">And this is also our reason for saying that some of these evils which have been described here which might be permissible if the Court of Appeals were affirmed, simply are remote from the holding below, because in such a situation where the buyer coerces brokerage fees from the broker, there is no question, but that there could be liability under the statute as it had been construed over a period of many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.970" offset="13359208">The departure comes in where the Commission says that the broker's acceptance of a lower commission is in fact a payment to him -- payment to the buyer by the broker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.689" offset="13410095">Of some significance also generally to this case, we believe that this is the first case in many years in which the Federal Trade Commission in presenting a case to this Court involving one of the Antitrust Laws has been joined by a private group of businessmen and not by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, which is charged with parallel enforcement of the Clayton Act and which customarily signs the Commission's brief, but has declined to do so in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.883" offset="13522944">The petition of the Solicitor General in this case, has an express notation that the Department of Justice in this case is appearing merely as the legal representative of the Commission and is expressing no views of its own as to the policy issues that may be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.813" offset="13586578">We think that it is quite significant, Your Honors, because we have urged in this case from the outset that the net effect and the sum and substance of the Commission's theory of this case would be to prevent the reduction of broker's commissions in competitive transactions and in effect, to freeze and stabilize and maintain the levels of broker's fees against competitive adjustment in the course of normal price bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.589" offset="13697755">The Justice Department, in similar situations involving mechanisms to stabilize brokerage commissions, has consistently prosecuted such conduct as an illegal restraint of trade in violation of the Sherman Act and, in effect, is prohibiting and prosecuting the very type of conduct which the net effect of the Commission's theory as urged here, before this Court would promote.</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.120" offset="13835891">Mr. Justice Harlan, if there was an actual payment again of money which there was not in this case, we believe that the broker again might be and no court has done so today, because the case is never arisen before a court, in such a case, the broker might be charged with having taken money from one side for the benefit of the other side, but once again this was the fact of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.184" offset="13928155">And so far as the policy of the Robinson-Patman Act is concerned, only last term, this Court's Simplicity Pattern opinion had occasion to discuss the policy of the Robinson-Patman Act and as I understand the discussion and analysis of the Court in that case, it is that the Robinson-Patman Act intends to foster and preserve open and competitive price reductions, because when price reductions are open such as they are here, they can be measured against cost economies which accrue from such transactions, so that benefit of more economical processes may be passed on from the seller to the customer and ultimately to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.759" offset="14098369">In this case, where there has been much discussion about the benefits to the small dealers, we think it is highly significant that after the main briefs in this case were filed, the Brookings Institution published a scholarly survey and study prepared by the Federal Trade Commission's former Chief Economist, Dr. Corwin D. Edwards, which has come to the conclusion that the Commission's enforcement of this particular section, the so-called, “brokerage clause,” has in fact, been more harmful and detrimental to the best interests of the independent and smaller dealer than it has been to the interest of the chain stores against whom so much has been said here today even though the facts of the situation have no remote relationship to chain stores and no chain store's a respondent in this case and the party to the case before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.425" offset="14281122">We believe the sole beneficiaries really of this type of enforcement of the Robinson-Patman Act which was never, never contemplated by Congress so far as we can discover, are the organized food brokers whose -- whose commission rates would be insulated and protected by the Commission's theory from competitive price reduction and who have boasted about this case and whose on the presence we believe pervert -- pervade the entire proceeding before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.823" offset="14386657">This is the classic conflict, if Your Honors please, of a strained interpretation of the Robinson-Patman Act by the Commission beyond the congressional text and beyond the congressional purpose in direct conflict with the principle of competition codified in the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.397" offset="14453008">Notwithstanding this Court's admonitions to the Federal Trade Commission in the Automatic Canteen case to reconcile the Robinson-Patman Act with broader antitrust policies insofar as the text of the statute permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.652" offset="14509955">I don't believe I have time to detail the salient facts and to go into the legal arguments as framed by the Commission, accepted to say that there is no issue before this Court and the facts of this case of any rebate payment or of any kickback payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.073" offset="14583620">Any discussions about the legal status of rebates or kickbacks or coercions by big buyers are purely hypothetical and have no relation to the issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.358" offset="14624789">What is more, there is no contest between us and the Federal Trade Commission on these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.947" offset="14643179">We have pointed out to the Court of Appeals in our briefs and we have reiterated in our briefs before this Court that in such situations as have been painted by the amicus curiae for the Commission and by the Commission itself, we do not contest that there may be liability, but those are simply not the facts at issue in this case before this Court.</text>
