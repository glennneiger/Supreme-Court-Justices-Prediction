            <label>Mr. Bert Cotton</label>
            <text syncTime="759.942" offset="3143137">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.563" offset="3157661">I would like to first, if I may, to address myself to the question put by Mr. Justice Black with respect to whether or not the Florida legislature would be in a position to be aware of the requirements found to be sufficient in the Watson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.753" offset="3254418">The legislature of the Florida has two statutes as part of the Florida Insurance Law, wherein they reach out beyond the state borders and wherein in so doing, they have all of the requirements which were found in the Watson case, a full declaration of policy, a full declaration of the evil or problem to be dealt with and a positive assertion of the need and necessity and desire to reach out beyond state borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.637" offset="3445948">I refer specifically to one -- one of the statutes to which I refer is the very statute that this Court had before it in the McGee case, service on -- on unauthorized insurers who send policies in or do things by mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.166" offset="3511986">Florida has a complete statute probably word for word in respect to the statute that Your Honors have before you which was a California statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.878" offset="3566843">I would like to point out further that Florida, its courts have never sought to give their statutes extraterritorial effect except for these instances to which I refer.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.934" offset="3647091">There is a case decided by the Florida Supreme Court, a case involving a Florida statute which provides that if a person dies in the State of Florida, leaving life insurance, then there are certain restrictions on the manner in which the proceeds of that insurance maybe payable, must go to wife, children, or certain protection for the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.348" offset="3784808">In that case, the insurer had procured his policy elsewhere, I believe in Alabama, some other state where there was no such restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.690" offset="3834128">He thereafter became a resident of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.906" offset="3846980">He died in Florida and there was a dispute between those who would be entitled to the proceeds of the policy if the Florida statute applied and those who would be entitled to the proceeds if the designation made by the assured was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.691" offset="3930154">And the Court said very expressly that although the statute doesn't have any -- anything in it to say it applies only to life insurance policies issued in the State and although the statute says if any person dies in the State leaving insurance, this shall be the rule, nevertheless, it is the law of the place where the contract was made which governs and we have no right to extend our statute outside of state borders to attach itself to such contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1507.274" offset="6132485">Now, with respect to the basic question of whether or not the interest of the State of Florida in this contract in relation to the -- its status of an Illinois policy or an Illinois contract was concerned, I would like to call Your Honor's attention to the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.004" offset="6243349">Aside from the fact that the policy was issued and delivered in Illinois and the full premium paid in Illinois and the insured was at that time a resident of Illinois, we have the following things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.033" offset="6299460">Under Illinois -- under the Illinois Insurance Code, this form of policy must be filed with the Insurance Commissioner, must be approved by the Insurance Commissioner and the issuance of any policy of a different form would be illegal and a violation of Illinois law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.712" offset="6374170">It's fully controlled both as to form and as to rates by the filings to the Illinois Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.724" offset="6410219">The plaintiff, Mr. Clay was a resident of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.513" offset="6425475">Therefore, this was not a matter of this company choosing issue policy in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.884" offset="6446895">It had no choice but to issue this policy because that's what the law of Illinois required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.542" offset="6469569">The premiums attached in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.386" offset="6476884">The honorary premium reserves, this being the policy issued in Illinois are governed by the law of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.512" offset="6505409">Loss reserves are subject to control, subject to review by the Illinois Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.129" offset="6531845">At the time the policy was issued, Mrs. Clay owned the residence which is named as the residence of the assured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.143" offset="6567894">They are attached to the policy of fine arts writer which covers six paintings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.706" offset="6594226">The writer says that these paintings are covered for the full amount of insurance in that place and for only 10% elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.659" offset="6638007">Not one single act occurred after the assured move from Illinois to Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.253" offset="6672384">No endorsements, no premiums, no contact whatever, nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.105" offset="6699760">We tried to the interest of Florida and we find that all we have is that after the policy attached and if I might to address for a minute say, “Mr. Reese said that they moved shortly after the policy was taken out, and it was probably two or three months.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.436" offset="6773112">Well, the case can't be controlled by whether three months or two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.999" offset="6787323">It was sometime during the policy term that they moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.798" offset="6806549">At the time of this loss, they had some -- they had property in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.461" offset="6825253">They also had property elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.483" offset="6837269">This is all movable property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.243" offset="6844374">These are all personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.844" offset="6854719">As Mr. Justice Stewart asked yesterday about the bank that this covers worldwide, it covers worldwide on property that had no situs just as in the Delta &amp; Pine case this Court pointed out that what was insured there had no situs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.036" offset="6927548">It would cover all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.788" offset="6938520">Now, with respect to Delta &amp; Pine and its application to this case, there were more reasons in Delta &amp; Pine for giving Mississippi the right to have its statute reach out to a contract made in Tennessee than there are in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.669" offset="7014066">In Delta &amp; Pine, the insured was a resident cooperate -- was a cooperation of the State of Mississippi at the time that the policy was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.486" offset="7057324">It happened to have its principal place of business in Tennessee and that's where it happened to get the policy, but the policy or bond covered employees in Memphis and employees in five named cities in Mississippi at the time it was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.812" offset="7138617">The fact that the treasurer who was in the home office in Memphis then moved when the company moved its main office to a state of incorporation back to state of incorporation was held by this Court to be insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.136" offset="7211865">So, we have a policy issued to a resident corporation of Mississippi covering property or covering people or activities in Mississippi at the time of issuance and nevertheless, as the Court held that the contacts of Mississippi were inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.514" offset="7281455">Now, we contrast that with the policy and the principles which underlie the Watson Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.084" offset="7315728">In the Watson Case, where you have as this Court pointed out an interstate business, a business that goes all over the country, it's only home permanence (Inaudible) consequently when the Gillet Company was negotiated -- or when the Gillet Company procured its policy with the employers' liability in Massachusetts or Illinois whichever State is the one that was the site of the contact, there came into being a contract which at that very moment was of interest to the State of Louisiana because Tony was sent into Louisiana and people in Louisiana might be injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.085" offset="7491688">And the State of Louisiana had a very manifest interest in the protection of its citizens because they might have to travel to Massachusetts to sue the Gillet Company if they were injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.458" offset="7541217">This Court observed that the statute was a part of an overall and comprehensive insurance law that it made it very clear dealing with an evil and it was seeking to overcome the evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.555" offset="7617599">We tried to the statute involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.924" offset="7631078">It's been one of the sections of the Statute of Limitation since 1913, unchanged since 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.382" offset="7672874">In the Insurance Commissioner's -- before the Insurance Commissioner's compilation of the laws of Florida affecting insurance, a booklet which includes all of the insurance code and many other laws affecting insurance, you do not find this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.153" offset="7755943">The manner of the strong public policy is to some extent negated by the fact that pursuant to a Florida Statute which authorizes the Insurance Commissioner to issue pamphlets and booklets and to distribute them to the public and to the governor and the members of the cabinet and authorizes there being in question and to form for the education of agents for the justice and what have you, there appears under the Fire and Allied Alliance which is the kind of policy we're talking about here a question, “What is the limit of time for the bringing of suit on a policy?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.420" offset="7933053">Answer - 12 months from the occurrence of the loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.620" offset="7953847">Now, we are criticized by counsel for the petitioner and by the Attorney General for citing a -- a publication issued by the Insurance Commissioner saying that doesn't make the law and Insurance Commissioner that doesn't make the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.550" offset="8033573">We do not claim that this shows what the law of Florida is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.838" offset="8054680">We claim only that if they were a strong public policy in the State of Florida against one year suit clauses, then most certainly, the man charged with the administration of the Insurance Law of Florida certainly would be the one to know about it and to state it in an educational pamphlet on which Florida adjustor was supposed to be governed and to learn their trade.</text>

            <text syncTime="2122.335" offset="8592697">Now, the question of whether or not the one year suit clause has been evil, whether or not it is something which creates a problem on which the State should have or can have and in this case we say Florida did not have any positive opposing policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.414" offset="8705024">The New York Standard of Fire Insurance Policy since the first addition back in 1883 has always contained the one year suit clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.881" offset="8746924">The latest version of it which is the 1943 Standard Policy contains the -- in substance the same clause requiring the suit be brought within one year from the inception of the loss, incidentally a harsher provision than this one because this one says one year from discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.973" offset="8819231">I mean, that's the delay and discovery that is not something that prejudice will be assured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.138" offset="8839920">The New York Standard Policy is adopted in 42 states and in the District of Columbia -- I'm sorry, 46 states and the District of Columbia, as is, without a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.964" offset="8891225">In 42 states -- I'm stating it wrong, 46 states but in 42 plus the District of Columbia, there was no change as to the one year suit clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.202" offset="8936155">In four of the States, they've adopted longer limitation, 15 months in California, two years in two of the other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.396" offset="8984952">It's been recognized in the opinions of courts and recognized by Insurance Commissioners that the longer the time to sue, the longer the necessity for maintaining reserves and they snowball because of the number of losses reported only a fraction of thereafter pursued for any one of the number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.655" offset="9098010">If -- Kentucky has a 15-year statute of limitations on contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.963" offset="9119222">Kentucky happens to be a State by the Court which held that its statute -- its invalidating statute does not apply to contracts made elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.778" offset="9154435">But, if you have reserves piled up one on top of another, year after year, you reach a point where your reserves make the company insolvent as far as its balance is concerned and the only remedy for maintaining a solvent position would be the increase of premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.329" offset="9248684">And so, there is an overall public interest in seeing to it that there is some reasonable limit on the duration of time for which a reserve has to be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.551" offset="9293615">And so, for that reason, we find that 42 states plus the District of Columbia have accepted the one year limit as a proper and reasonable limit.</text>
