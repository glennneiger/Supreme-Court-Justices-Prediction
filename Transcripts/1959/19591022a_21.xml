            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 21, McElroy, Secretary of Defense, et al., Petitioners, versus United States, in relation of Dominic Guagliardo.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.871" offset="158908">Mr. Schuchat, you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_a_schuchat" startTime="16.970" stopTime="376.652">
            <label>Mr. Michael A. Schuchat</label>
            <text syncTime="16.970" offset="171238">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.132" offset="183881">At the recess yesterday, I was pointing out the fact that a soldier cannot quit whereas a civilian employees such Guagliardo has the privilege of quitting his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.678" offset="230066">And Mr. Justice Black in part what the situation would be if there were enlistment at will rather than enlistment for a fixed term.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.374" offset="268831">Now the -- of course as the hypothetical question changes the facts, but even in that situation, a soldier would be subject to discipline and would have -- have to obey orders whereas his situation would be different from Guagliardo who was simply an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.291" offset="340511">The relationship of Guagliardo to the service is simply an employer-employee relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.551" offset="369560">In fact until after World War II, it was never thought that the relationship was such that it should subject him to court-martial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.060" offset="403623">Illustrative of that is the decision of this Court in Duncan versus Kahanamoku.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.773" offset="426506">In that case which involved the military's power to court-martial in Hawaii in time of war, that petitioner Duncan was a civilian employee of the navy who was a ship bidder at the Navy Yard at Pearl Harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.373" offset="484916">He was -- and precisely -- had precisely the same status as Guagliardo.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.621" offset="505814">The other petitioner was a civilian stockbroker, named White.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.265" offset="524413">Now White's crime was embezzling some stock belonging to another civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.470" offset="549282">Duncan's crime was engaging with -- in a brawl with the marine sentry at the gate of Pearl Harbor Navy Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.088" offset="575718">This Court said that they were both civilians not connected with the service and entitled to the rights of civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.454" offset="605184">Now, it seems to me that if the navy could not court-martial Duncan in time of war in Hawaii then certainly the Air Force cannot court-martial Guagliardo and Morocco in time of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.533" offset="665475">Now I will pass over the historical problem because I think it's necessary to read the historical material cited in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.183" offset="724093">I don't have a time here, but if -- I think that when read the materials, you will be convince that there is no historical precedent for this type of jurisdiction, but essentially the Government's case is predicated on necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.192" offset="780100">They say that the practical necessity overrides everything else and justifies the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.816" offset="802670">Our position is that the necessity is irrelevant, but assuming that the necessity is considered, the Government has not made out a case of necessity such as would justify this extraordinary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.411" offset="857004">The Government's case for necessity is based primarily on the replies which it received from various military commanders throughout the world which were reprinted in one of its briefs in the Covert case.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.820" offset="914683">And this -- these replies are adopted again in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.437" offset="933073">Now if you examine the replies of the various military commanders whose -- which are printed in those briefs, you will see that the primary problem which they have consists of black market offenses and traffic offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.300" offset="992528">This is -- this is over 80% of the number of crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.977" offset="1011231">Now it's obvious that a traffic offense is a problem of the host country.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.824" offset="1030666">It's a violation of a host country's laws and will be prosecuted by the host country.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.545" offset="1053550">Similarly, black market offenses are violations of the host country's laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.468" offset="1077269">They're probably not even a violation of the United States law and they will be prosecuted by the host country.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.850" offset="1106735">Of course, the United States is concerned that our people, any American abroad not violate the law and that we are concerned with the economic condition of our allies where we have troop stationed, but this is not primarily the concern of the defense department and it certainly should not give rise to court-martial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.917" offset="1195029">Now the Government then points to cases such as security cases, involving classified information.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.239" offset="1224286">These cases are obviously extremely rare.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.099" offset="1235780">They can very easily be prosecuted in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.905" offset="1251035">I say that they're rare not because I have the figures, because the figures have never been made known, but if they were of any real concern to the Defense Department, the Defense Department after the Covert decision would have gone to Congress and would have had the slight change in the statute which was probably necessary to make them triable in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.327" offset="1328671">And in addition, it would seem to me that in offense involving disclosure of classified information abroad is so serious that it should be tried in an Article 3 Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.378" offset="1372871">Now, the Government also contends that cases involving only United States citizens or only property of the United States will not be tried by the host country.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.028" offset="1419473">They say that the host country won't be interested in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.574" offset="1433684">The fact of the matter is that is this is proven in the very cases which were before this Court now.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.786" offset="1454477">In Guagliardo, the crime involved stealing property of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.802" offset="1478614">The Morocco Nationals who were charged with the conspiracy were tried by the Moroccan Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.081" offset="1503692">Certainly, disapproving the thought that they're allies are not interested in people who steal from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.394" offset="1528978">So far as crimes involving only Americans, the -- the facts in the Grisham case, which is the fourth case before Your Honors, will show that the French Government was -- was quite reluctant to let the American military try them and had Grisham not been court-martial, he would have certainly been tried by the French Government.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="376.652" offset="1609958">But it wasn't -- insofar as this argument is relevant on either side, wasn't there a very strong, a powerful feeling in Congress against trial that the Americans could be tried by -- by our tribunals against their being tried under what was rather, I thought a rather chauvinistic attitude on the part of many Congressmen that you can't get their trials in -- in the various host countries.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.680" offset="1854046">I would point out to Your Honor that so far as Morocco was concerned, in 1956, the United States Government with congressional approval gave up its consulate court in Morocco subjecting all for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.154" offset="1916008">Subjecting Americans to Moroccan courts and it would seem to me this happened in 1956.</text>
