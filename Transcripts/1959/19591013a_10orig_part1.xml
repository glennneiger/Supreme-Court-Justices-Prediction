            <text syncTime="17.780" offset="174477">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.843" offset="214706">In view of the fact that the question of what the boundary was that the Congress was trying to provide for and its intention and purpose in this Submerged Lands Act is so crucial to a consideration of this case and to what the States received under the relinquishment or grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.849" offset="310732">I'd like to deal with that first in a number of different situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.274" offset="332466">First, I would like to call your attention to the Act of the Republic of Texas, its Boundary Act of 1836 on page 340 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.342" offset="392756">If you recall, throughout the argument in the briefs, great emphasis is placed upon the fact that the Texas claim is based upon the assertion in that statute of what its boundary is, what it was from 1836 on.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.148" offset="483976">That was the action of the Republic of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.948" offset="495156">And I want to particularly call your attention to the language that from and after the passage of this Act, on page 340, the civil and political jurisdiction of this Republic be, and is hereby declared to extend to the following boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.124" offset="575822">That is not terminology for any special kind of boundary, any special submerged lands idea, any special smuggling idea, any special idea or concept of boundary that has been discussed in the States' briefs at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.912" offset="655026">That is the description of a general, political boundary for general jurisdictional purposes, like the United States is contending Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.322" offset="712704">And that, in their own language, they described it for what they intended to be to give them civil and political jurisdiction for that Republic, and that is the fundamental basis of their claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.956" offset="783235">Any place you look, if that statute was void and if they had never passed it, I think you'd find that their claims evaporate in thin air.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.969" offset="831300">But they have described the kind of a boundary, and they proceed to talk about it at great length throughout the debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.724" offset="886262">I hope you'll bear with me a little on calling your particular attention to language from the debates, because I think in this argument, it will be more clearly understood if you don't have to rely just on my claim as to what -- or the other side's claims, as to what the debates were about.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.754" offset="978422">But if we review here at least a portion, I can't cover it all this time, of the statements made by the parties, keeping in mind that these statements were made in order to try to defeat the attempt to amend this Act so as to reduce it for all our purposes, to three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.898" offset="1062954">So that in no event could anyone get beyond three miles, and it was to meet up with that kind of a contention that they represented time after time that this Act did not give any State, anything whatsoever, and I'll read the words of the people that they say where the draftsmen and Senator Holland, Senator Daniel that represented Texas, Senator Long that represented Louisiana, Senator Cordon, who was the manager of the bill in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.175" offset="1196074">Time after time after time, they said this bill does not give any State anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.425" offset="1241109">And they also said --</text>

            <text syncTime="1422.428" offset="5793102">And I was trying to eliminate these ideas about different kinds of boundaries because I don't think they can be urged in good faith in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1604.636" offset="6521919">When the Congress of Texas sat down to -- in 1836, December, it passed that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.101" offset="6555773">It was looking at several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.612" offset="6565804">Things that were most conscious of was the Treaty between Spain and United States in 1819 which called to fix the boundary, the Louisiana boundary between Texas and Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.479" offset="6609272">And it called to commence on the Gulf at the mouth of Sabine in the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.434" offset="6637066">So the most -- the first thing they had to consider was that they -- the boundary calls commenced in the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.598" offset="6661726">Now, the second thing they had to look up at was that in 1811 and 1812, the state boundary of Louisiana had been fixed by an act of Congress first, carving out the territory and then it made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.363" offset="6720867">And so they look at that description which was a matter of law and that description called to commence at the mouth of the Sabine goes around Louisiana and call for all islands within three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.746" offset="6770395">So that were two things they had to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.366" offset="6780844">Now, if they had heard anybody to look at letters of the Secretary of State in fixing boundaries, they could have looked at the letter that -- that Mr. Jefferson wrote when he was Secretary of State, the 1790 -- 1793 letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.006" offset="6839359">And what did that say?</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.992" offset="6847300">It said, first, that the greatest distance to which any respectable set among nations has been given is human sight or 20 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.042" offset="6879587">It said second, that the smallest distance is a canon shot or three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.735" offset="6898291">It said, third, three leagues has some authority in its favor, and it says fourth, that we ought to call a convention of the nations to fix -- to fix the maritime boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.352" offset="6936743">And said that we will reserve the right to fix our maritime boundary but tentatively and for the time being, we are fixing it at three miles, and they said three leagues has got a card in its favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.535" offset="6981465">So what did those people do in writing that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.053" offset="6991600">They did a logical thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.197" offset="6996198">They commenced in the sea as the Treaty command them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.828" offset="7006647">They tied on to the Court of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.586" offset="7013752">They concedes it to be which was three leagues and Jefferson had said that three leagues had some authorities favored, so they thought they were within the policy of the United States and we say they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.955" offset="7055235">Now, the next fact in these series of events which you're looking at for the annexation is the recognition of Texas by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.103" offset="7095777">Now, there was a great public interest at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.825" offset="7106644">The conscious of the Nation had been shocked by the massacre at Goliad and the -- the tragedy of the Alamo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.071" offset="7139662">And the people had been elated by the victory of San Jacinto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.277" offset="7152515">The whole spirit at the time request for an expansion and the whole attention of the country was concentrated on these events going on along the frontier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.145" offset="7183966">And so, on December the 19th, they passed this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.797" offset="7198595">Now, we've just had a visit from the President of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.932" offset="7211133">At that time, they had another visit from another President of Mexico, Sta. Anna.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.881" offset="7226911">The President of Mexico has brought a prisoner of war and appeared before Jackson and his cabmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.113" offset="7247809">The only time in the history of United States, that's happened and discussed this very question of the boundary of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.327" offset="7272678">It was a question of great public importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.729" offset="7282291">It was debated all over the country and the whole country knew about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.488" offset="7297337">And it passed this Act and they gave it wide circulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.830" offset="7318653">Jackson was charged by his opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.387" offset="7328893">He was being -- having denied with Sam Houston his friend and -- and protégé to bring about this Texas revolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.444" offset="7357106">And so Jackson was cautious in recognizing Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.155" offset="7367973">He waited some six or seven months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.858" offset="7378840">And then on March the 3rd, just before his term expired, the Senate passed a resolution authorizing to recognize Texas and there appoint an agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.938" offset="7415097">And on March, the -- that was on March the 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.306" offset="7424606">On March the 3rd, which was the last day of his great administration, a turbulent administration, won the grace from United States as the last official act of that administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.732" offset="7466297">At 11 o'clock in the evening, he called in the people from Texas to the agent and -- and have a glass of wine and recognized Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.284" offset="7496495">That's the last thing he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.581" offset="7505690">And at that time, there was no protest, no diplomatic protest of this -- this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.510" offset="7525439">And we say that's a positive evidence of United States foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.798" offset="7538604">The normal way for a country to formalize its foreign policy and leads matter just by diplomatic protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.265" offset="7560443">And there was none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.951" offset="7563160">And we say that's evidence that this Act did not violate the -- the foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.624" offset="7585834">The next event of any consequent was the authority of annexation attempt in 1838.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.672" offset="7610075">After the -- after that recognition, the people of Texas, by a general vote, voted to come into the Union, and then there was an abrupt change of climate, a public opinion all over the United States, because Texas was injected into the called over a debate our slavery and slave territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.055" offset="7671620">And so -- and this -- a second thing involved this Texas Boundary Act, and that was that it had claimed a part of what's now used to be Mexico, the old Spanish town of Santa Fe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.314" offset="7716655">And so the opponents of annexation argued that it was an expansion of slave territory that it involved a certain war with Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.588" offset="7749674">And that generate one of the most heated political controversies this country has ever gone through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.247" offset="7768377">Congress was covered up with -- with petitions, memorials, resolutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.646" offset="7785932">One Congress had said they were measured by the cubic feet on its desk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.662" offset="7802023">Over 600,000 signatures appeared from the congressional records against the -- the annexation of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.175" offset="7832116">Ex-president John Quincy Adams, then a member of Congress and the leading architect of our foreign policy up to that time, (Inaudible) from June the 16th, July the 7th, every morning until Congress adjourned and he himself killed annexation at that time, and that no -- at that time, there was no protest of this Act although it had been woven into all of these debates because of this question of the -- of the -- going north into -- beyond the Missouri compromise lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.358" offset="7944756">The anti-slavery -- the post slavery people said this would bring in free as well as slave territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.142" offset="7967953">The anti-slavery people said, “Well, the -- the free territories barren mountains been headed by wild Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.391" offset="7992926">And -- so that was a matter of public debate and that Texas Boundary Act was known throughout the United States at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.715" offset="8018213">Now, the next consequence -- that of any consequence of the fact to be considered was the 19 -- 1830 Boundary Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.062" offset="8051649">The Act itself, the final clause of it, if you'll notice, commanded the President of Texas, to call for a convention with the -- with United States for the purpose of putting that to be in line on the ground, and that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.523" offset="8101491">The Texas Boundary Commissioner was instructed to follow the Texas Boundary Act, in that they had a treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.481" offset="8125315">They had a joint commission appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.522" offset="8133465">Mr. Hunter Miller, at page 136, I might -- might say that -- that this record here is the official record of the State Department published by Hunter Miller is -- is the -- the last words so far as United States and everybody else is concerned on -- on diplomatic foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.638" offset="8209951">Mr. Hunter Miller says the boundaries of Texas, as claimed by the Government has thus described in the instructions of March 30 -- 21st, 1830 from (Inaudible) and Secretary of State, Memucan Hunt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2180.637" offset="8825919">And Tyler, the incumbent president, who had been repudiated by his own party, sought to organize a third party on the motto of Texas and Oregon.</text>

            <text syncTime="2697.443" offset="10893145">The Congress of Texas, by Act of December 19th, 1836, had declared the Rio -- Rio Del Norte to be the boundary of Texas and this message of war he referred to this very Act, Solicitor says (Inaudible), as far as the maritime boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.499" offset="10949360">And he says the couple of full variance has been exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.121" offset="10959809">And he goes on and he says that Mexico has invaded American territory and shed American blood on American soil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.198" offset="10996172">Thomas Jefferson Green, who was the author of the Act in the Texas Congress, records that he later on discussed this with -- with President Polk and said President Polk had little out of legal international rights to the bank of Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.564" offset="11049671">He complimented me for my happy thought and being the author of said law and said without it, he never would have move up to that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.333" offset="11076733">Now, we come to Guadalupe Hidalgo at the end of that war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.905" offset="11090944">And again, we say this is an act of foreign policy that is absolutely controlled of everything else in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.388" offset="11116962">Polk had written to Sly Bell who was his first agent to negotiate the Mexican boundary claims that he should follow this Act and he identified it by name and date of everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.285" offset="11156564">And then he appointed to Mr. Trist who is the chief clerk of State Department to negotiate Guadalupe Hidalgo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.791" offset="11182582">And he instructed Trist that he was to prevail upon the Mexicans to agree to the line established by the 1836 Texas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.389" offset="11212884">And then the Texas Legislature passed a resolution instructing their senators as follows, that our senators be further instructed to oppose any treaty with Mexico, which may provide for resting the boundaries of Texas as establish by an act to finally bound of Texas approved December 19th, 1836.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.979" offset="11279339">And Article 5 of the Treaty resulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.573" offset="11289684">And it says that the dividing line between the two Republics shall commence in the Gulf of Mexico three leagues from land and further from Rio -- Rio Bravo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.244" offset="11320299">Now, on that, I want to join issue with the Government on what they say about that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.584" offset="11337749">They say that Act just goes out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2811.957" offset="11351228">Now, any lawyer knows that a boundary divides territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.548" offset="11365543">If it doesn't divide territory, it's not a boundary, just an act sticking out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.526" offset="11385501">This is something why you just make a tight rope, walk out and back and you can't step off either sides.</text>

            <text syncTime="3071.784" offset="12390484">We say that strengthens our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.812" offset="12398634">And here is the direct language of that protest, “I've been directed,” this is the British, “I've been directed the State, United States Government that in order to prevent future misunderstanding, Her Majesty's government think it right to declare that they cannot acquiescence in the extent of maritime jurisdiction assumed by the United States and Mexico in the article in question.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.546" offset="12465507">And here is the reply from Buchanan, Secretary of State, “In answer, I have to state the stipulations the Treaty can only affect the rights of Mexico and United States if, for their mutual convenience, it has been deemed proper to enter into such an arrangement, third parties can have no just cause of complaint."</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.725" offset="12522245">The Government of the United States never intended by this stipulation the question of the rights that Great Britain or any other power may possess under the Law of Nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.639" offset="12549935">Now, we say that that's a positive statement of the foreign policy of United States that there wasn't a three-league limitation in the -- in the Gulf, because had there been, they would have been questioning by putting this into treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.046" offset="12595597">And they have replied over protest that this Treaty did not violate Britain's rights and then in spite of that protest, they went ahead and put it in the Treaty, and they put it in the Gadsden Purchase, and they put it in all these boundary commissions down through the year since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.123" offset="12647842">And we say that that protest absolutely nails down the Texas case that in response to a protest from a foreign power, they insisted on that clause in the treaty and kept it and replied to Britain that it was no concern of yours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.625" offset="12697893">Now, one good reason that that reply was good was that when Texas was recognized by Great Britain back in 1837, a copy of the Texas Boundary Act had been served on Britain at the time, and this was some 12 to 14 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.883" offset="12754944">And they had never protest that Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.030" offset="13015542">And then I call your attention again to the State Department map on page 111 of the Texas brief which has recognized it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.584" offset="13045739">So we say that -- we think we've absolutely nailed it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.920" offset="13063084">And I don't see how the Court could find that boundary strongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.612" offset="13081788">When the commissioners who negotiate with the annexation were told to insist on that boundary, when the President of the United States in -- in effort to pass it, assured Sam Houston that the boundary would be respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.639" offset="13133928">When they came in, when they went to war over a portion of that boundary and in the war message identified the Act and -- and when the President in a message says, “This is the Texas.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.232" offset="13172276">And then when the President in a treaty with the foreign nation instructed its negotiator to incorporate that boundary into the Treaty and it was incorporated and it stayed there over a protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.302" offset="13212609">We think that the strong case of foreign policies you could possibly make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.030" offset="13227447">Now, on the negative side, we say, we -- we say to this, that the Solicitor has not done a single piece of evidence before 1855.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.049" offset="13267571">It says, as a foreign policy of the United States that no nation can go beyond three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.428" offset="13289096">We just hadn't got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.823" offset="13294634">The first time that United States asserted that no nations go beyond three miles of 1855.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.075" offset="13319711">We say that Jefferson's letter stated exact contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.094" offset="13331728">Jefferson's letter said, “We're asserting a three-mile minimum, and the Nations can go further and we are reserving a right to go further.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.526" offset="13357432">And that was the foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.528" offset="13365478">And so we say that the Texas Act was in -- in constants with and in harmony with the foreign policy of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.894" offset="13394944">And it was so intended to be and it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.106" offset="13403826">And -- and we say further that there's no three-league at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.975" offset="13423261">We prepared a table on the general international law, which appears in the back of our -- our book which cites some 100 odd parts to the fact that at that time, a three-league boundary was permissible boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.106" offset="13475819">Under the circumstances, we feel like that -- that Texas is entitled to judge from this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3471.392" offset="13988968">The best evidence, of course, in the intent and effect of the Act are -- is the wording of the Act itself that Congress had intended to limit Texas three miles and all the States it would have stopped at the words -- after the words “three geographical miles distance from the coast line of each State.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.295" offset="14060544">But it did not so intend and it did not so stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.672" offset="14074023">It went further and said that the grant should extend beyond three miles in a case in such cases where a State's boundary, not at the time, but as it existed at the time it entered the Union, it extended beyond three miles into the Gulf of Mexico and not to exceed three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.095" offset="14159705">Now, the record cited in our separate briefs show that those terms were written into the Act by Congress and recommended by President who understood the facts and the history related here by Attorney General Wilson who understood that President Polk had promised Sam Houston who, although not president, the record show that annexation depended on his support.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.453" offset="14253223">And there is cited here by the Solicitor General a letter saying by the U.S. Representative that “I left Sam Houston believing he would not deport annexation.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4191.667" offset="16870066">The boundary of the State of Texas is the boundary which was established for the State of Texas when she voluntarily pulled down her own flag and ran up the flag of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.789" offset="16910503">That boundary has not changed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.711" offset="16922206">Mr. Daniel, “It may be that the Senator from Illinois wishes to make certain that the State of Texas does not claim that its boundary, at the time of its admission, extended beyond three leagues.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.774" offset="16962435">And I -- the record shows that he was assured that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.341" offset="16980720">Then Mr. Douglas says, “Mr. President, does the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Cordon, the manager's bill, agree with the interpretation of the Senator from Texas and I've said all about what our boundary was and how far it would go under this bill.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.769" offset="17034428">Mr. Cordon, “The Senator from Oregon is not going either agree or disagree.</text>

            <text syncTime="4544.671" offset="18282036">I'll check the admission of all the States including Alaska and Hawaii and I say to the Court that you don't find where any State has ever admitted to this Union without its boundaries being fixed, prior to the moment of admission until the final act of admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4559.437" offset="18341073">The Solicitor General has simply ignored the congressional practice which has been followed through the history of this country, of letting the people of a territory set up its constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4569.563" offset="18381615">If it's a -- if it's a U.S. territory, the boundaries are fixed usually in the Enabling Acts or in the State Constitution which is written before the State finally comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.173" offset="18420067">Take for instance here the other day as to the Hawaiian Islands. Congress passed the Enabling Acts saying what boundaries would be admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4588.742" offset="18458311">But it required the people of Hawaii to both, to change their previous boundaries and set the boundaries that were to come in and did not allow the present issue of proclamation of admission to the Union until the people of Hawaii had changed the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.474" offset="18521318">The whole point is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.089" offset="18531767">That in the practice of Congress which was certainly known to Congress when they wrote these words into the Act, it was to allow -- to fix the boundaries beforehand, before the final separate Act of Admission, the moment of admission comes about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.110" offset="18595819">And so clearly, there had to be some boundaries fixed and have been in the case of every State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.251" offset="18612328">Now, telling the Solicitor General to show this Court when stated where the boundaries of a prospective state were not fixed prior to the moment that the final act of admission took the effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4640.005" offset="18663424">Certainly, that is the case in Texas, an independent nation at the time that we came in and certainly that was the intent of the Congress to go to those boundaries fixed at the time they entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.986" offset="18719326">They had to be fixed prior to that time in a Constitution or in some enabling act or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="4660.333" offset="18744717">Now, that was the interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.729" offset="18758301">That was also stated on the floor of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.274" offset="18776482">On the floor of the Senate, Mr. Senator Anderson asked -- Senator Anderson asked, “Why don't you just put the historic boundaries and write them into this bill.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.368" offset="18852864">He replies on page 51 of the Texas brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.142" offset="18867911">And I would not quote it here except that the person making the reply on the Senate floor was a co-manager and co-sponsor of the bill and -- and gave exactly the reason the terms we used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4705.782" offset="18926529">Starting down on page 51 about the second paragraph of the quote, now, this is in reply to Mr. Senator Anderson's question he's asked on page 50, “Why not simply include the term historic boundaries in the pending measures?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.929" offset="18991104">Well, on 51, the Senator from Texas, a co-manager of the bill has said, “Of course, Texas boundaries did exist at three leagues at the time of annexation, and the Texas and Florida three-league boundaries were heretofore approve the Congress but that is history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.900" offset="19050977">As the Senator from Florida said, the intention was the rights specifically into the joint resolution what the office had said all along would be its effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.637" offset="19081906">That it covered only and within on the historic boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.072" offset="19095698">The only way I know to describe the word “historic” by means of definition is to say as the boundaries existed when the respective States entered the Union are heretofore approved by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4759.572" offset="19141674">There's good reason, Mr. President why those words should be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4763.286" offset="19156511">The Supreme Court of the United States has said in several cases that the Federal Government can do nothing to change the area of a State after it has entered the Union with fixed boundaries except with the consent of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.673" offset="19202069">There's another line of cases which hold that if the boundaries are set out in the State Constitution such as the Constitution of the State of Florida which is approved by the Congress of the United States, then the United States cannot change those boundaries without the consent of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4790.396" offset="19264972">That is why the terms “now impaired” are used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4794.453" offset="19281168">This would -- words mean nothing if they had not been spoken on the Senate floor by a committee member and by a co-manager and author of the bill.</text>

            <text syncTime="4816.099" offset="19367790">They were taken from court decisions, but I will say this, Mr. Justice Black, this was not challenged at all, and you'll see in reading all these excerpt from congressional history that it was not challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4827.166" offset="19411989">They are as to the -- as to what the author has said was the meaning of the word why they were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.201" offset="19436126">They are taken from court decisions which have been written in cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.262" offset="19448456">This was still a reply to Senator Anderson with situation similar to the present one, and quoting still, for instance, in New Mexico versus Colorado, the Supreme Court said that the right of a State upon its admission into the Union to rely upon its established boundary lines cannot be impaired by any subsequent action on the part of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.230" offset="19528286">And then -- and in New Mexico versus Texas, New Mexico, when admitted as a State in 1912, explicitly declared in its constitution, that was, of course, before the final Act of Admission, that its boundary ran alongside 32nd parallel to the Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="4872.904" offset="19594951">This was confirmed by the United States by admitting New Mexico as a State with the line thus described as its boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.988" offset="19619297">Now, that was the reply as to why use those boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4883.927" offset="19639045">And you will find that Senator Anderson later on after that in the excerpts he himself interpreted this bill as given to Texas three leagues or to some States 10.5 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.932" offset="19691081">You'll find a statement quoted here because Senator Anderson, it was who offered the First Amendment on the Senate floor to cut all State back to three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.404" offset="19725040">Then the next amendment on the Senate floor was offered by Senator Monroney.</text>
            <text syncTime="4909.597" offset="19741759">And then it cut all States to three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4912.463" offset="19753253">And he argued, “Texas is going to get three leagues, it ought to get it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4917.274" offset="19772479">Then the next one was offered by Senator Magnuson.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.025" offset="19787421">And he argued the same thing and all his amendment would have done, it was the short one, would have just trimmed everything back.</text>
            <text syncTime="4927.819" offset="19814693">It would have stricken out all of the 171 words the Solicitor General now asks this Court to strike out in your decision, in the decision he asked this Court to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.425" offset="19861086">But the Congress -- the Senate of the United States said, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.594" offset="19877700">And here's the important part.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.205" offset="19888149">In this last Magnuson amendment, the issue was drawn on what Texas ought to get how far it ought to go under all principles of equity and justice and under this boundary which was recognized by our Presidents including the President of the United States who had written this letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4966.930" offset="19971114">And President Polk back there at that time and which exists in our Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, as Mr. Justice Black says that Treaty, I mean brought out, that Treaty still in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4978.188" offset="20016149">If you have to have a national boundary in the Gulf of Mexico at three leagues in order for best to win this lawsuit, we certainly have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.248" offset="20052407">That Treaty is still in existence and Mr. Jack Tate of the State Department appeared, he was deputy legal adviser before our committee, not by letter but so you can examine it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.893" offset="20094934">And he said specifically that the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was still in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5002.944" offset="20115101">The Solicitor General quotes only three words he said in his reply brief, but here is what he continued to say, “I do think,” here's what Mr. Tate said, “The United States recognizes the Treaty as setting the boundaries between Texas and Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.577" offset="20185631">I do not think the State Department has had occasion to pass on the question as to territorial waters claimed by the Texas vis-à-vis of the Nation because of Guadalupe Hidalgo.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5030.833" offset="20226696">This is very important because there, you have the State Department's legal counsel sent by Mr. Douglas to the Committee himself drawing a distinction between territorial waters and boundary and showing that territorial waters or maritime jurisdiction can exist at a lesser distance than boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5049.026" offset="20299525">The Treaty only purports to set boundary as between the United States and Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="5053.384" offset="20316871">We recognize that boundary has been set by the Treaty but I think we have not had to pass on the question of whether the territorial waters by reason of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5061.301" offset="20348531">In other words, he says the boundary is definite.</text>
            <text syncTime="5064.017" offset="20359398">But as far as the rights of the territorial waters on account of our policy is an unsettled thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5070.553" offset="20385625">We do not agree with Mexico on it and -- but Mexico is still claiming that, it's unsettled but boundaries, these three leagues out the national boundary and as General Wilson said, it came from the Texas Boundary Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="5119.486" offset="20581334">Senator Holland on the floor used the map, stayed on the floor for weeks as shown by the record and which Texas has shown as going three leagues under this bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.119" offset="20619891">I think the clearest evidence is the fact when the issue was joined Congress voted not to limit to three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.072" offset="20643610">And certainly, in addition to that, we have contemporaneous construction by those who administered the bill, the Secretary of Interior as we show in the brief all these leagues form apply to three leagues to Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="5149.167" offset="20700035">All his leagues form for four years, Texas has made nine separate lease sales by public auction in this area in four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.160" offset="20732008">And we don't have any all out there yet between three miles and three leagues, that's the less I heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.758" offset="20754369">But those lease sales who were given to the Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.817" offset="20774640">He put out a statement they would not lease any closer to shore than three leagues, that he recognized Texas boundary of three leagues in his contemporaneous construction of the Act which he has to write and which Eisenhower Administration (Inaudible) to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5180.495" offset="20825318">And the present case from contemporaneous construction that they signed the bill, that he was glad to restore, I believe he said, these lands to the States in accordance with the claims that they've made over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5192.311" offset="20872652">And even the year this suit was filed, the President wrote the Governor of Texas saying, and it's in our brief, “In further response to your telegram, it is my view,” This is the President of the United States in power and the Secretary of State, as I understand it in foreign policy matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5210.857" offset="20946840">“It is my view, Texas should have the right to explore and exploit the submerged lands extending seaward of the sections coast line for a distance of three marine leagues of the Gulf of Mexico in any action that it maybe necessary for the Attorney General to take by reason of the June 24th order of the Supreme Court.</text>
