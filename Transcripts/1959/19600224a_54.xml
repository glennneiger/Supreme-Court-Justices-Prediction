        <section startTime="0" stopTime="3623.601">
          <heading>Argument of John F. Davis</heading>
          <turn speaker="john_f_davis" startTime="0.000" stopTime="218.525">
            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">This case involves no issue of fact -- fraction but only a naked question of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.655" offset="185971">The issue is simply whether Congress has power to cut off aliens' Social Security benefits when they are deported on the basis of membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.888" offset="250964">The case comes here on direct appeal from the District Court for the District of Columbia which held that Mr. Nestor's Social Security rights had become vested and could not be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.901" offset="318986">Although this Court postponed the question of jurisdiction until argument, the appeal appears to fall squarely within the word and the spirit of the jurisdictional statute which authorizes direct appeals from a District Court decision holding an Act of Congress unconstitutional in a case in which the United States is a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.350" offset="428805">The only apparent question on jurisdiction is whether or not the suit below should have been before a three-judge court rather than below -- before a single judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.395" offset="484916">But this suit was instituted by Mr. Nestor pursuant to the specific provisions of the Social Security Act which provides a remedy for review of administrative decisions by a District Court and makes no provision for a three-judge court in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.761" offset="554402">The three-judge court provision of course comes into effect when someone attempts to enjoin the operation or execution of an Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.563" offset="593586">It does not control where the action is under a specific review provision such as this and where there is no injunction against the operation of the Security Act -- Social Security Act involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.127" offset="655862">Therefore, it seems clear to us that the District Court is a single judge, did have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.026" offset="679476">And since his action was specifically based upon unconstitutionality of an Act of Congress, this Court in turn appears to have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.515" offset="737468">Ephram Nestor came to this country from Bulgaria as a young man in 1913.For some reason, he never was naturalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.654" offset="797968">But in 1933, he joined the Communist Party and he remained a member of that party at least until 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.678" offset="842062">On the basis of this Communist Party membership -- preceding this were commenced against him in 1953 to deport him to Bulgaria which was the country from which he had come.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.425" offset="901099">And he was, in fact, deported in July of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.754" offset="930356">Meanwhile, he had qualified for Social Security benefits and in fact, for several months had received Social Security benefits amounting to $55.60 a month.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="218.525" offset="977481">That was between 1953 and 1956 that he qualified for the benefits?</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="223.059" offset="995558">Well, he actually qualified as of November of 1955 and the first -- it was the -- the order came in 1956 just before he was deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.264" offset="1040384">So he received the payments for November of 1955, December and end of 1956 until he was deported.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.642" offset="1129932">He was -- he was a painter by profession and some of his earlier employment came soon after the Act was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.022" offset="1167444">As was specifically provided by a 1954 amendment to the immigration law, the Attorney General notified the Social Security Administration when Nestor was deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.029" offset="1219480">And this is also specifically required by the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.638" offset="1233899">The payments for Social Security payments were then terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.280" offset="1248528">Neither of these actions is subject to discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.845" offset="1258768">It's automatically under the statutes that when a man is deported for this reason that his payment should -- shall be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.840" offset="1298683">Mr. Nestor appealed the termination of his -- of his -- of these benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.012" offset="1319372">He was granted a hearing before a referee in the Social Security Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.022" offset="1343509">The -- the decision was upheld by the referee and after having exhausted his administrative remedies, he then went to the District Court and asked for review of this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.776" offset="1390425">And as I mentioned, the District Court held that the statutory provision cutting off the benefits was unconstitutional and it is from that out -- the Government has appealed directly to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1557.569" offset="6333628">This was -- this was litigated and the Court -- and never got beyond the District Court but the District Court held that this was an appropriate amendment by -- by Congress and that rights could be cut off in this nature, in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.009" offset="6395382">I may say there's been some experience too with the state retirement systems and there is a case, Pennie against Reis, an -- an old case, 132 United States in which it was held that -- I think that was the California retirement systems holding that they could cut off benefits even though they had once been received within general statutory power to amend.</text>

            <text syncTime="3886.007" offset="15647431">But Section 202 (n) was enacted in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.945" offset="15675120">It grew out of the bill which was H.R. 9366 which was reported to the 83rd Congress by the House Ways and Means Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.305" offset="15712632">That particular bill had three provisions which I think are relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.201" offset="15740217">One provision attempted to do something along the lines, which Mr. Davis has indicated here, might be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.530" offset="15773445">That is -- or keep benefits away from aliens who are not within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.730" offset="15806255">That was a bill which would deny benefits, not to the primary beneficiaries themselves, not to the workers themselves, but to certain dependents or survivors of beneficiaries who reside outside the United States if they do not meet certain residence requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.381" offset="15888906">Now, in proposing that bill, Congress said, and this was not Congress but the House which proposed that bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.091" offset="15927777">Under a heading in its report, and we set forth and quoted at page 19 to 20, “Under present law, old-age insurance benefits had been paid to an insured worker regardless of his country of residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.546" offset="15993605">Benefits are also payable to otherwise eligible dependents and survivors of insured individuals regardless of country of residence even though such dependents and survivors may never have lived in the United States and may have had no personal contact with the insured worker over a long period of years other than receiving contributions to their support.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.383" offset="16084929">And then the Committee went on to say, “Your Committee believes that the insured person himself, who has earned his right to benefits on the basis of his work in American Industry and his contribution to the national economy should be able to have those benefits regardless of his place of residence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4018.472" offset="16177298">In other words, the only suggestion made here that I have heard, and Mr. Davis didn't make it as strong as the Government did in his brief, was that 202 (n) was part of a policy of Congress to deprive aliens, nonresident in this country, of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.721" offset="16250232">And yet here, we find the same Congress, House which proposed 202 (n) saying that it never had such intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.747" offset="16282311">And as a matter of fact, any such provision would be unwise and unjust.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Rein</label>
            <text syncTime="4052.733" offset="16314284">I was reading from my brief 19 to 20, quoting from House Report Number 1698, which accompany or the bill, H.R. 9366, which became -- later became the 202 (n).</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.713" offset="16390248">The same bill, however, contain a provision which later became 202 (n).</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.643" offset="16417938">And in discussing that provision, Congress did not put it under a heading, “Payment of benefits to persons residing abroad.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.346" offset="16452733">On the contrary, they discussed it in its report under a heading “Termination of benefits on deportation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.537" offset="16489514">And, and I'm reading now from page 21 as to what the House said with regard to that, the House said that the bill provides that all benefits payable on the earnings record of an individual who was deported from the United States because of illegal entry, conviction of a crime or subversive activity shall be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.902" offset="16587003">Termination of the benefit would be effective upon receipt of a notice from the Attorney General that the individual is under notice of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.193" offset="16632142">Now, when this bill got to the Senate, the Senate rejected this provision and also another provision which contained a penalty provision by denying benefits for earnings for aliens who might have been in the country unlawfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.095" offset="16711764">The Senate rejected all three of those provisions but it, like the House, considered only the first provision, the one that will take away benefits from dependents and survivors abroad to have anything to do with the policy of making payments to people who are out of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.810" offset="16786578">And it said with regard to that in the Senate Report and it's quoted at page 22, “That the House approved bill would have prohibited the payment of dependents and survivors' benefits to individuals residing outside the United States unless such individuals met certain requirements as to prior residence in the United States or a less special insured status requirements were met by the worker on whose records the benefits are payable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.911" offset="16899009">Your Committee does not believe the place of residence of the dependents or survivors of an insured worker should result in their losing protection to which they are otherwise entitled as a result of contributions paid by the insured worker.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.221" offset="16960240">That was the Senate's view with regard to the question of paying benefits to people abroad and outside the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.580" offset="16985736">Turning to this provision, which later became 202 (n), the Senate said, “The House approved bill would have required that no monthly benefits be paid on the basis of wages and self-employment income of an individual who has been deported for specified causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.538" offset="17057520">Your Committee has not had an opportunity to give sufficient study to all the possible implications of this provision which involves termination of benefit rights under the contributory program of Old-age &amp; Survivors Insurance and has therefore deleted this provision from the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4257.774" offset="17134425">Now, I think these conclusions appear from this short sketch of the legislative history, and I'll -- our finding, I should say, that in conference, the House receded with regard to the provision depriving dependents and survivors abroad of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.758" offset="17206418">The Senate receded in their objection to the provision which later became 202 (n).</text>
            <text syncTime="4280.827" offset="17226689">Though with certain modifications, the provision in the house bill was then passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.746" offset="17246333">Now, I think that these conclusions appear from this short sketch.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.177" offset="17264097">In the first place, Section 202 (n) was not considered by either House of Congress to be -- have any bearing with regard to a congressional policy of withholding the payment of benefits to aliens residing abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.181" offset="17320103">On the contrary, the House Committee that first suggested 202 (n) explicitly stated that it rejected such a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.939" offset="17355107">The Senate rejected even a partial application of such a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.453" offset="17381230">The House agreed and we have no such policy at all adopted in this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.794" offset="17426578">Both Houses, however, considered that Section 202 (n) were penal in character, and they said so in so many words because -- and Mr. Davis has had a great deal of difficultly distinguishing perhaps between the four provisions of the deportation statute which were omitted from those who were deprived benefits and those provisions which were included.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.254" offset="17524381">But the House made its distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4356.847" offset="17530755">We don't have to go any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.876" offset="17538905">It said that -- the House of the Senate said that, “Benefits are terminated of -- for those individuals who have been deported for unlawful entry, conviction of a crime or subversive activities.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.156" offset="17591986">They thought that that group included all those and clearly, these have moral connotations and the distinction was made on the basis of congressional view of moral guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4385.226" offset="17644231">Now, as a matter of fact, the original defendant in this case, Secretary Folsom, the predecessor of the -- for the present defendant, also considered this provision to be a penalty in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.274" offset="17716433">He was asked to testify with respect to a subsequent provision, which, I think, Mr. Davis has mentioned which was being considered by Congress in 1955 which would make a penalty of deprivation of Social Security benefits, an additional penalty to be added on to criminal penalties to those who are punished under the Smith Act and other crimes which Congress considered in that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.843" offset="17834715">Testifying on that provision, Secretary Folsom opposing the provision, and he opposed it on this ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.431" offset="17865122">He says, “Because the deprivation of benefits, as provided in the amendment, is in the nature of a penalty and based on the considerations foreign to the objectives and provisions of the old-age and survivors insurance program, the amendment may well serve as a precedent for extension of similar provisions to other public programs and to other crimes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4462.300" offset="17952580">And then he went on to say, “The present law recognizes only three narrowly limited exceptions to the basic principle, the benefits are paid without regard to the attitudes, opinions, behavior or personal characteristics of the individual.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.176" offset="18020080">And he included in those three narrowly limited exceptions this provision 202 (n) which Congress had passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.572" offset="18053622">The other two he mentioned which he said considered to be of a light category, were not a statute of Congress but a regulation of the Social Security Administration itself which denied dependents benefit payments to any individual who have been found guilty of the felonious homicide of the insured worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.197" offset="18132198">And also said other provisions are not of the Social Security Act but of Title 5, that is the provision giving government employee pensions, the so-called Act which was passed -- the Act so-called Hiss Act which was passed by Congress relating to government employees, denying pensions to government employees who, among other things, have pleaded their privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.326" offset="18228642">A portion of the statute which was held unconstitutional in the Court of Claims was not taken to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="4640.744" offset="18666350">Now, the Government in arguing that the statute here is not a penalty, in arguing in its brief, makes the point that it's not the question and some emphasis has been made here by Mr. Davis that the point is that the alien is no longer in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.781" offset="18750464">He's abroad, and why should we make payments to him while he's abroad?</text>
            <text syncTime="4666.716" offset="18770213">However, the important thing is that if this same alien had left the country, had gone abroad on his own volition, exactly where he was, he would receive Social Security benefits under the present law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.291" offset="18844505">So the factor here is not that he's abroad but the factor is that he has been deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="4692.649" offset="18873971">That is the significant difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="4707.551" offset="18933530">There is -- was a subsequent statute which was passed in 1956 which has never been construed by any court, which did take away benefits from certain aliens who departed -- left the country and been away for more than six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.840" offset="18998732">But only to those aliens who had not been in the United States with an aggregate of 10 years in the first place, or who did not have full coverage under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4738.837" offset="19058709">In other words, there is a present provision which is 202 (t) which does take away benefits from certain aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.954" offset="19103222">The particular petitioner here would not fall on that category because he had been in the United States for more than 10 years and he had the necessary coverage under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.805" offset="19146585">So -- and for this category of people, such as the aliens, the significant factor is deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.029" offset="19175528">And the law -- and under the laws that presently stands, if he were abroad, under -- on his own volition without deportation, he would continue to draw Social Security benefits until his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.953" offset="19239163">So, we argue, therefore, from this that there isn't any policy here of keeping the money in the country and not sending it abroad because Congress has enacted such a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.377" offset="19304887">And in fact, the money would be sent abroad to aliens in the same category as the petitioner here except for the fact of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.005" offset="19347414">I think too, and the Government concedes that -- that the statute would be invalid if the deprivation of benefits were based upon or the fact of antecedent factors and the Governments were criminal or other socially undesirable conduct because the Government concedes that under the same scheme of Social Security or the conduct of an individual and his behavior in the language, which was used by Secretary Folsom in testifying before the Senate Finance Committee, has no legitimate bearing upon receipt of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.865" offset="19518882">Yet, under 202 (n), one cannot escape the conclusion that that is precisely -- are the basis upon which benefits are being deprived to certain class of deportees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.039" offset="19575515">I have already quoted to the Court the language used by the House and the Senate Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.204" offset="19596204">Illegal that the -- of -- deprivation of benefits are based upon deportation where the deportation is in turn based upon illegal entry, conviction of a crime or subversive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.130" offset="19647927">Now, the Government in its original opposition that its original jurisdictional statement which was filed in this Court at -- when it was first looking at the statute, I believe, without the problems being presented as to how it could defend it, didn't have the difficulty Mr. Davis had here of distinguishing between the different characteristics of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.666" offset="19746043">And I think and I like to quote from the provision of the jurisdictional statement because I think it's obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="4917.206" offset="19772165">And the Government there suggested that the four excluded provisions do not fall into that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.559" offset="19797556">That is the category of unlawful entry, conviction of a crime or subversive activity and may have been excluded because Congress thought they did not involve serious derelictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.406" offset="19841024">I think that it is perfectly clear both from the language of the reports of the Senate and the House in describing the position and also on the basis of analysis of the provisions themselves that the distinction Congress was making between certain grounds for deportation and certain other grounds of deportation were distinctions relating to moral conduct, and ideas which have definitely, a punitive aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4963.222" offset="19956276">In that sense, the Section clearly specifies or offenses for which a person is then being guilty and for which retribution is exacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.662" offset="19998072">I think one must clearly look at 202 (n) and one cannot without it in any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4978.652" offset="20018030">And it sets forth the certain categories or grounds for deportation listed in the Immigration Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.025" offset="20047496">And it says that, “Individuals who have been found guilty not by any criminal case but in an administrative proceeding of those offenses for which they are deported, they shall then suffer the penalty and the punishment of being deprived of their Social Security benefits.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.477" offset="20121266">I think finally, we must consider the statute to be a penalty and punitive in character under the analysis which was made by this Court in the Trop case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5015.218" offset="20164211">That whenever a statute comes before this Court, and it -- and it has consequences which appear to deprive one of a privilege or ceratin other benefits, and then if the Court cannot find any legitimate legislative purpose for that deprivation of benefits, the only conclusion that the Court can come to is that -- or the statute is being imposed as a penalty and his punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5045.694" offset="20286151">And in the language of the Trop case, the Court there said that that statute was punishment because there is no other legitimate purpose the statute can search.</text>

            <text syncTime="5837.331" offset="23452714">The whole process was done administratively.</text>

            <text syncTime="5875.116" offset="23603806">“We regard it as settled by our previous decisions that the United States can, as a matter of public policy by congressional enactment, forbid aliens or classes of aliens from coming within their borders and expel aliens or classes of aliens from their territory.</text>

            <text syncTime="6256.985" offset="25131342">On the assumption, if I may have just a moment, that an ex post facto law does cover penalties of this character, this statute is an ex post facto law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6270.434" offset="25185155">Now, the Government makes some contention in its brief that it's not an ex post facto law because in fact the statute was passed in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="6282.156" offset="25231966">The alien did not actually become -- receive his benefits until 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="6288.809" offset="25258611">But I think what is important here for ex post facto considerations is the date of the conduct on the basis of which the penalty was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6300.903" offset="25306990">And that conduct terminated in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="6305.789" offset="25326529">I think it's indicated earlier by Mr. Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6308.174" offset="25336038">He said there was no clear termination date.</text>
            <text syncTime="6310.456" offset="25345233">What is significant here is that the Board of Immigration Appeals, which was the body which decided that the alien was deportable and set forth the grounds, said that his membership in the Communist Party had lasted or terminated in 1939 or at least that was the last date on which they found membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="6333.158" offset="25436035">So that we therefore find that -- or the conduct which terminated in 1939 was the basis of the later penalty which was inflicted upon and first by the 1950 statute of deportation and now, by the 1954 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6350.578" offset="25505729">And I think it comes within the language used to describe the ex post facto clause in the American Communications Association against Douds case in which it said that what is controlling is whether the conduct to which the individuals are being punished has been completed, so that “nothing that those persons proscribed by its terms could ever do or change the result.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6382.509" offset="25633416">And that was the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6385.132" offset="25643865">After 1939, there was nothing that the petitioner here could do that would change the result which led to the depravation -- first is deportation, the deprivation -- laid the deprivation of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="6398.167" offset="25696005">Now, the fact that he could be deported on that ground is really not relevant here because this Court has held that deportation is not punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6410.198" offset="25744175">And therefore, they said that the ex post facto clause does not apply to deportation on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="6419.319" offset="25780642">I think finally, and on the view that this is a penalty and that is being penalized for the conduct which was their membership in the Communist Party it is clear under the cases in this Court that the conduct here which the petitioner engaged in was protected by the First Amendment, is shown both the Yates case and by the De Jonge case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6442.183" offset="25872071">And for any loss of privilege or punishment to be inflicted on the basis of conduct protected by the First Amendment, would be a violation of that provision of the Constitution.</text>
