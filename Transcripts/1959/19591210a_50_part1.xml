            <text syncTime="29.976" offset="223274">11 years ago, Jesse Blackburn, a young Negro, been a young Negro, was taken into custody by the State of Alabama on the charge of robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.227" offset="272280">He has been continuously held in the custody of Alabama from that date to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.064" offset="303626">The first five years, he was detained in an insane asylum in the State of Alabama under the adjudication by the Circuit Court of Colbert County, that he was insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.204" offset="356185">For the last six years, he has been detained in prison in Alabama on an adjudication by the Circuit Court of Colbert County that he was not insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.096" offset="403728">If this seems arbitrary and inconsistent, we think the facts will abundantly show that it is just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.670" offset="438000">Petitioner was before this Court at the 1956 term, seeking the reversal of his conviction on the ground that the confession upon which his conviction was predicated was involuntary and hence denied him the due process of law guaranteed to all persons under the Fourteenth Amendment of our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.385" offset="528906">This Court vacated the judgment of conviction and remanded the case to the Courts of Alabama because of uncertainty in the record as to whether the Courts of Alabama had passed upon petitioner's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.811" offset="594631">The opinion of the Court of Appeal which is set out in the record, makes abundantly clear at this point, that the Courts of Alabama have passed upon the constitutional rights of the petitioner under the Fourteenth Amendment and have rejected his contentions under that Section of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.173" offset="680103">The conviction and sentence imposed by the Circuit Court of Colbert County on petitioner was to 20 years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.488" offset="725347">The facts concerning the weight that this confession was obtained, came entirely from the Deputy Sheriff who procured the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.282" offset="768502">This was necessarily so because petitioner was -- Jesse Blackburn was unable to recall any of the events leading up to his arrest, his confinement in prison and indeed for some months or years after he was committed to the insane asylum in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.362" offset="852825">The medical records of this petitioner reveal that, he had already had a determination by medical doctors, was apart of his record, that he did suffer recurrently from prolonged period of amnesia.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.860" offset="902771">Whether this was the reason that at the trial, he couldn't recall of whether it was the treatment given him in the hospital in Alabama which as you know, with respect to schizophrenic, frequently include shock treatment whether that was the reason he couldn't recall any of this circumstances, we don't know, but the fact remains that the sole testimony did come from the Deputy Sheriff.</text>

            <text syncTime="702.092" offset="2911692">Now, such a confession obtained after nine or 10 hours of -- almost constant grilling by relays of law enforcement officers would be a doubtful validity we submit, even if Jesse Blackburn were facing abnormal will a normal man.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.525" offset="2989432">That was somewhat a paraphrase of the statement in the Haley case, Haley against State of Ohio, where the petitioner had been grilled for some five hours straight and was a 15-year old boy and the Court went on to after making a remark that that five hours of sustain grilling would be doubtful validity more of a (Inaudible) years and normal faculties, it then went on say it, certainly was not enough for a person of, only 15 years of age.</text>

            <text syncTime="2264.270" offset="9160495">Now, in the Fikes also, this Court took notice of the fact that Fikes was an uneducated person and of low mentality but of course here, the incapacity is infinitely greater than in the case of Fikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.721" offset="9226219">In Fikes, the said matter of significance, it was noted by this Court was that Fikes had had at the most one previous experience with the criminal processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.383" offset="9272926">So far, it appears in this record, Jesse Blackburn had no previous experiences with the law and it's difficult to see how he could have since he had been the insane asylum since he was led out of the army.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.991" offset="9327365">So, the three -- three of the matters that were of greater significance to this Court in Fikes are all present here and into a much greater degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.815" offset="9362683">In Spano against New York, this Court said, “the limits of constitutional due process in any case depends upon the weighing of circumstances of pressure against the power of resistance to the person confessing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2493.888" offset="10078960">It never purported to apply the test which this Court has laid down in those cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2523.270" offset="10196407">But, again, referring to the report on the basis of which Blackburn was adjudged insane and committed to the hospital for some four and half years, look at page 76 of the record, the last paragraph there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.342" offset="10276760">There is the statement by all three of the doctors, Dr. Richards on whom the Court of Appeals relied and the other two doctors, it is the opinion of each of us and our opinion jointly and collectively, that the said Jesse Blackburn at the time of his admission to the Circuit hospital was insane and incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.472" offset="10365262">And also, that it's their opinion that he was insane at the time of the offense of which he was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.483" offset="10393266">So, we -- and not only that, but in the same deposition which the Court of Appeals suggests, it finds substantial conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.659" offset="10430046">Dr. Richards was asked the question whether he still conformed to the opinions which was stated in this order and he stated that he did at page 77 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.402" offset="10492949">What Dr. Richards said on cross examination after affirming his view as stated in this report that Blackburn was insane when he first examined him and insane in his opinion at the time of the offense, he said at page 81 of the record, that Jesse Blackburn was up on the terminal wall and he was such a nuisance until I didn't see him often.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.181" offset="10608097">Dr. Harry looked after him mainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.117" offset="10619800">Then he asked him, “was he normal?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.364" offset="10624815">He said, “Yes, he was normal all the time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.918" offset="10635055">Asking if he had psychotic episodes and he says, “None.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.294" offset="10660551">And then they say, at the bottom of page 83, state in ordinary lay language, what a psychotic episode is, they said he couldn't answer that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.409" offset="10697017">Then, he was asked, “is it not the fact, Dr. Richards from your observation of Jesse Blackburn that he at times has lucid intervals and he answered at the bottom of page 82 of the record, “I do not think so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.763" offset="10758457">So, that here's the Doctor that the State of Alabama is relying on for this substantial conflict in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.881" offset="10786879">And I submit that if Dr. Richards' testimony stood alone, that it would not overcome the presumption which is the law on Alabama that a confession is presumptively involuntary because he is the man that says, that he doesn't think this fellow ever had lucid interval in his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.601" offset="10865768">He can confirms that he gets -- that the man was insane when he first examined him and was insane when he committed the crime and -- it would -- the Court of Appeals states that it -- that the -- Richards' testimony was in hopeless conflict to the testimony of the other doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.476" offset="10945285">I submit that in all candor Dr. Richards' testimony was in hopeless conflict with Dr. Richards' testimony and that it could in no way overcome the presumption that this man was insane.</text>

            <text syncTime="3085.882" offset="12446908">First of all before I get into my formal argument, I would like to discuss some of the points that had been raised in Mr. Hobbs' argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.753" offset="12526425">It is our position that there never was a judicial determination of insanity in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.111" offset="12599777">The only judicial determination was that made by the jury when they convicted him of this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.695" offset="12658186">Now, the procedure and the petitioner tends an adjudication if a statutory procedure in Alabama by which the trial judge if he has reason to do so, may have a prisoner examined by physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.873" offset="12822862">If those physicians are of opinion that the prisoner maybe insane or if they feel that there is probable cause to believe that he is insane, they shall inform the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.748" offset="12922337">Then the judge may under our statute, Title 15, Section 428 Alabama Code 40, he may send this prisoner to be examined at the Alabama State Hospital, the insane hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.803" offset="13058591">Then still under this statutory procedure, a commission maybe appointed as was appointed in this case and may make a report to the circuit judge as to their opinion concerning the mental condition of the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.676" offset="13214072">Now, this old procedure as I have stated is statutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.131" offset="13251897">There is no adjudication involved except there are -- is a statutory provision for these orders to be made by the Court ordering the petitioner sent to the insane hospital and ordering him back for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.250" offset="13396407">Now, for Supreme Court of Alabama, in the case of Benton against State 1872 has held that this procedure -- procedure is not a judicial determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3438.659" offset="13858043">Now, the report is included in the record here because in answer to their position the report was a test as an exhibit to the answers to interrogatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.048" offset="13963577">That is the only way we to have it adjudged and had the benefit of the report as the matter of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.051" offset="14031600">Mr. Hobbs had mentioned the fact that the only evidence on voir dire as to the condition under which the confession was given was stated by the Deputy Sheriff that here is the only evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.213" offset="14152182">And that is true yet it only came to in chief that the defendant did testify this was after the confession had been ruled admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.485" offset="14241311">The defendant then both -- the jury took the stand and testified that he was insane at that time and then he didn't remember anything about the questioning of the answers which he gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.928" offset="14355101">I'm merely bringing that out to point out that there was nothing to prevent this defendant from taking that position on voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.492" offset="14425318">And while introducing that evidence at the time he now claim -- claims that his right of the protection of due process were violated and I have been handling the case that would given the jury to over (Inaudible) the only evidence introduced by the petitioner on voir dire was the two doctors' definition who strongly stated that the petitioner was insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.491" offset="14685288">Then, our own propositions that one other point, the petitioner admits that that was relay questioning or sustained questioning of this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.758" offset="14774418">Now, I haven't seen a case of this Court under these circumstances under eight or nine hour questioning with a break of -- with the answers and the statement being taken out in long hand by Deputy Sheriff who to say the least was not an accomplished ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.590" offset="14981726">I have never seen a case of this Court which held that under those circumstances that the length of the questioning would render him voluntarily confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.875" offset="15062915">There is also an intimation that this petitioner was questioned by more than one law enforcement officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.526" offset="15125504">I believe the record will show that the answer of the Deputy Sheriff was to the effect that I'd -- in the questioning out was there all attack that is out with question on cross examination was anyone else there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.976" offset="15251310">It takes years the Sheriff and another Deputy were in and out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.666" offset="15290075">Did they questioned the petitioner, his answer was that they may have but the import of the whole thing as I read the record, wouldn't this man's standing was conducting this investigation was questioning further here that that these other gentlemen were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.368" offset="15444825">I believe it was Mr. Justice Harlan had asked Mr. Hobbs about lucid intervals, about the doctor's testimony concerning that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.614" offset="15533850">All three doctors, who made up this commission, testified that Blackburn did have lucid intervals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.079" offset="15603649">Dr. Richards' deposition shows that he was of the opinion, that the man was not -- but the other two doctor's answers revealed that they also think that at least some other time that his mind, was normal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.077" offset="15735724">Dr. Rowe says that during his stay in State Hospital, he was -- his mind was more normal than abnormal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.512" offset="15833422">A question has been asked concerning the other evidence connecting this petitioner with the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.381" offset="15888906">And I agree with Mr. Hobbs that it would be difficult if not impossible to convict this man of the other evidence the State has shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.718" offset="15950242">However, there was more evidence than -- than Mr. Hobbs stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.225" offset="15988276">In addition to the Buick automobile, maroon in color which was seen by the rolling store at the time the crime was in Illinois (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.622" offset="16069883">It was shown that, some one or two days before the crime was committed that the operator of this rolling store stopped at a house at which the petitioner was staying and that questions were asked by the petitioner and by his friend concerning the trips, concerning the number of times that the rolling store passed that way and that the -- and when the rolling store would be back again.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.696" offset="16362141">Now in the confession itself, the petitioner states that he and his friends from Illinois didn't have the money to get back to Illinois and that they robbed the rolling store for that purpose to obtain those cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.984" offset="16555342">Now, after this Court remanded this case to the Court of Appeals of Alabama that Court treated of the petitioner's claim as being two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="4143.242" offset="16676342">They said that the petitioner claims his confession was obtained by sustained questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.256" offset="16732348">Second, that the petitioner claims that he was insane at the time he confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.319" offset="16792639">On the first proposition concerning his sustained questioning as we've already discussed the entire evidence in that regard was the evidence of the Deputy Sheriff to obtain the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4202.506" offset="16913429">The Court of Appeals held that the circumstances surrounding of the giving of the confession, did not amount to those coercions that this Court has held violate the process and we take that of course on no conflict in the evidence in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.726" offset="17106317">There was only one man to testify in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4257.850" offset="17134738">The Court of Appeals held that nine hours of questioning with an hour of break during that time (Inaudible) on the statement by the person who was doing that job in wrong hands that it was not an accomplice scribe, did not file for a due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="4342.603" offset="17473808">Now on the other point that is discussed by the Court of Appeals in its opinion on the claim filed by the petitioner that he was insane at the time of the confession, the Court of Appeals had pointed out by Mr. Hobbs, said that there is conflict of evidence in the record in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.622" offset="17661889">They're being in conflict of evidence, the Court Appeals held into -- in the absence of the trial judge who had witnesses and the petitioner before was in a better position to decide in that coercion than with the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4421.672" offset="17790098">The Court of Appeals states it as problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.349" offset="17812773">They say, “When confession are admitted on the controverted questions of fact, this Court will not revise the rulings of the lower court admitting now unless if he can manifest the wrong, leaving a vast discretion with the trial judge.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4460.510" offset="17945370">Now, that statement is, I submit sentimental to the statement of this Court in Lisenba against California where this Court held that if it will accept defining of the local court on controverted questions of fact, unless such findings are not supported by evidence and would of -- and the acceptance of -- to find it was worthy, worthy on -- then it didn't -- law with due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.656" offset="18226030">Now, as to the conflict in the evidence of these doctors as I've stated their reports in only in the evidence as an exhibit to their depositions, all three doctors of the commission are answered interrogatory definitely, Dr. Tarwater is the -- he, in of the Alabama State Hospital system.</text>
