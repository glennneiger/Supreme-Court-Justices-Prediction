            <text syncTime="1078.876" offset="4418853">Reluctance there has been to use the processing of federal courts in restraint of state officials, though the rights asserted by the complainants are strictly federal in origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.916" offset="4470993">This argument regarding equity jurisdiction assumes that the District Court has jurisdiction to dispose of the entire case, has the jurisdiction to rule on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.231" offset="4516342">It questions whether the District Court in the exercise of a sound discretion sitting in equity should issue an injunction restraining the state officers in enforcing this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1120.582" offset="4585723">The appellants handle and sell limes, mangoes, tomatoes, potatoes growing out in Florida.</text>

            <text syncTime="1139.968" offset="4663254">The picture presented by appellants even when State is favorably to them shows that in one of their markets, California, appellants said they market a substantial volume of one of their products, avocados; they hesitate to increase the volume of this fruit because it may not meet the California standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.055" offset="4743607">No present irreparable injury appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.528" offset="4757504">This appears mainly as far as substantial hold is concerned that it looks to the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.156" offset="4791986">At most, all that the appellants desire here is to rearrange their present distribution of sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.549" offset="4833573">The direct appeal is to show that the appellants at any time had been charged with a crime or a judicial action has been brought against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.368" offset="4868890">We believe that these facts are now at least to the facts in Spielman Motor Sales Company which involved a retail sales dealer, automobile dealer in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.160" offset="4907969">And the state law to which he was objecting control the manner in which he operates his business, that is, granting discounts and full disclosure to the purchases of automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.568" offset="4945690">This Court pointed out that he was not put out of business by the statute and that he -- there was no serious interference with his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.974" offset="4983306">Therefore, that the District Court, although it passed on the constitutional validity of the state statute, in the effect, abused his discretion in not passing on its equitable jurisdiction first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.234" offset="5044328">To state a case in equity in a case of this action, appellants must show that the interference by the state statute is indeed serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.772" offset="5082467">If the Court finds that this interference is not a sufficient gravity to justify the extraordinary remedy of an injunction, then, we suggest that the Court may wish to remand the case to the District Court with a request that the District Court consider its appellant's -- its equitable jurisdiction to see if appellant's case does state a case in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.663" offset="5178075">However, we feel that on this case which on the record is complete here that the lack of equity is so strong that the Court as it did in Spielman may wish to reverse with instructions to dismiss on the --- for the grounds of lack of equity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.546" offset="5337527">Appellants claim that the California statute, as applied to them, conflicts with the federal market agreement and the regulations adopted thereunder for the marketing of Florida avocados.</text>

            <text syncTime="1334.312" offset="5440658">I remind the Court in particular of the series of cases recently decided in which various state enactments relating to labor relations have been held by this Court to be unconstitutional and invalid, because of conflict with the National Labor Relations Act as impinging upon the Federal Regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.288" offset="5592482">Most of these cases have come to this Court on appeal from state courts, which yesterday I mentioned one that came here on appeal from a three-judge District Court, American Federation of Labor versus Watson and the jurisdiction of the District Court was upheld and the jurisdiction was entertained of the appeal, which in that respect, is exactly the situation in this case.</text>
