            <label>Mr. Wayne G. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="14.879" offset="162879">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.089" offset="175731">During World War II, the Government seized and operated, for a short period, a number of motor carriers in the Midwest that were closed down by strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.467" offset="213243">The respondent is one of those carriers whose properties were in the federal control for about 10 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.971" offset="239261">The respondent is now, been given an award of just compensation for that seizure measured by the rental value of his equipment for the 10-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.018" offset="291401">The question is whether that award is ordinary income, as we contend that it is, or whether it is capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.503" offset="325360">The Tax Court held that it was ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.530" offset="341452">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit -- it was capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.379" offset="360887">That decision which was in direct conflict with the decision of the Eighth Circuit involving another carrier, is here on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.426" offset="401115">The facts of the seizure are relevant here only as background and can be briefly dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.209" offset="424208">In August 1944, the over-the-road drivers of a 103 motor carriers in the Midwest went out on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.588" offset="461720">The strike was prompted by a refusal of the carriers to pay a wage increase recommended by the War Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.412" offset="493066">Because of the emergency, President Roosevelt promptly directed the Office of Defense Transportation to take possession and control of those lines and restore them to operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.407" offset="548968">That was accomplished by a series of orders and directives in that effect of which was that the carriers were required to pay the wage increase and resume normal operations subject to all of these to an ultimate federal control.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.041" offset="607587">Now, the federal control was relinquished as to the respondent in June 1945, it was approximately 10 months after they were first seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.816" offset="654608">After the war, Congress established the Motor Carrier Claims Commission to determine whether the carriers were entitled to just compensation under the Fifth Amendment for that seizure and if so to determine the amount as the word of that Commission to the respondent that is an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.582" offset="741752">The Commission held in this case and in other cases that the dominion exercised by the Government over the carriers was efficient to constitute a constitutional taking of the temporary use and possession of the physical properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.591" offset="817716">It held that in the case of a temporary taking, the proper measure of just compensation as the rental value of the property for the period that was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.814" offset="866617">And since the respondent here would have been free to lease out its equipment, trucks and trailers individually, that rental value should be measured here by the rental value for each item of equipment and the Court determined that those rental values added them up and the total was the award made.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.405" offset="953031">Now -- and that award represented a net rental.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.651" offset="969958">That is to say, the rent that respondent could have obtained for its trucks in excess of all operating expenses, all depreciation, as those cost had already been recovered out of the operating revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.511" offset="1033383">So in -- in effect, this award represents pure rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.308" offset="1048639">It's a return on investment to the petitioner for the use of his property for the 10-month period.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wayne G. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="275.942" offset="1207150">The total award arrived in that basis with $190,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.302" offset="1224600">The parties later agreed to reduce it to a $130,000 and $7000 which represented the operating income during the tenure period was credited against that to produce a net award of a $123,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.332" offset="1288652">Interest was also allowed in that award of 4%.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.229" offset="1304325">Now, we think it is clear that in all events that interest element is taxable as ordinary income regardless of how you treat the principal amount of a $123,000 and so we can limit the discussion here to the -- the principal and not of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.447" offset="1365138">But we do not, in any way, challenge the Commission's award.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.316" offset="1376632">We accept the determinations on which it was based namely that there was a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.005" offset="1399411">There was a taking of a temporary use of the property and that the rental value was a fair measure of the value of the interest taken, namely, the right to occupancy for 10 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.334" offset="1460746">Our position is simply that what one receives has compensation for the use of one's property, whether you call it rent, whether you call it just compensation, whatever you call, it is ordinary income and not capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.199" offset="1524172">Now, the respondent's contention is that the proper -- that the gain, this capital gains under Section 117 (j) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.107" offset="1579760">That provision treats as capital gains, any gain from the involuntary conversion of property into money and respondent, in effect, argues that the -- a right to the temporary use of the property is, itself, property.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.439" offset="1661158">It's a property interest and since that right was involuntarily converted, the requirements of 117 (j) are met -- are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.258" offset="1704417">I would like first to avoid the particular problems of involuntary conversions and take a case of a voluntary transaction which essentially similar to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.380" offset="1748929">Assume a case of a homeowner who conveys to a lessee a 10-month leasehold of his home in exchange for $1000.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.430" offset="1793128">Now, I take it that even the respondent will agree that that is not capital gains, that the -- the $3000 they received in exchange for the 10-month leasehold is ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.348" offset="1836805">It becomes important to identify the reason why that is not ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.646" offset="1861987">Now, the general definition of capital gains is in Section 117 (a) of the 1939 Code which defines capital gains -- gain on a sale or exchange of capital assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.887" offset="1914964">Capital assets have been defined simply as property held by the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.591" offset="1933772">Let us say capital assets are property.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="460.185" stopTime="460.742">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="460.185" offset="1944116">Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="wayne_g_barnett" startTime="460.742" stopTime="633.328">
            <label>Mr. Wayne G. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="460.742" offset="1946311">There's no further definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.509" offset="1953416">There some minor exclusions which aren't relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.152" offset="1967940">So if and my hypothetical example, we treat the leasehold interest that the homeowner conveys to a 10-month lessee, has a property interest at which he exchanges for $3000, there has been exchange of property and therefore, literally it ought be capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.941" offset="2051114">Now, how to avoid that result? One way to say that is not really a sale or exchange is really a lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.540" offset="2081520">But that -- that really assumes the answer to the question of what is the property that you're talking about if -- if by property there, you mean the house and there's no doubt that they haven't sold the house, and it's only leased.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.620" offset="2145886">But if it is permissible to speak of the short term right of occupancy for 10 months as itself being a property interest, then that interest, the right of occupancy for 10 months, he has sold -- sold or exchanged and is not leased.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.873" offset="2210879">So the problem is -- is what things you treat as property for purposes of the capital gains provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.868" offset="2238882">What kinds, nature of and duration of interest qualified as property?</text>
            <text syncTime="540.051" offset="2263542">Now, as I -- I suggested there are many purposes for which you would treat a temporary right of occupancy as property, for example, to require the payment of just compensation for its taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.823" offset="2322683">But if Congress meant property in a capital gains provisions in that all inclusive sense, there would be nothing else but capital gains, because virtually everything we think of -- and as ordinary income, usually involves a property interest of that sort that would be the subject of a sale or exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.306" offset="2404603">For example, a -- a stockholder could each year sell his property right to receive the dividends for that year and if that is property for some purposes and if it's property for purposes of capital gains provision, that would mean that all dividends can be converted into capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.733" offset="2478268">So Congress did not use property in -- in that broad sense and the courts have very properly limited the application of the capital gains provisions to transactions which involved a more or less, complete conversion of the taxpayer's investment in the underlying asset and they denied capital gains treatment to lesser estates, lesser temporal short-term estates, which are -- are as it where carved out of that fee interest, which the taxpayer retains.</text>

            <text syncTime="786.968" offset="3251284">That's right and I -- I agree with you that the use of property for the right of occupancy -- the right of use of property for a 10-month period is property for many purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.817" offset="3290676">So primarily, this property for purposes of Fifth Amendment, but it is not property within the meaning of that term as used in 117 (a) or 117 (j).</text>
            <text syncTime="808.847" offset="3338742">If it were, every time that I purported to sell voluntarily, a 10-month leasehold, it would still be property.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.567" offset="3369671">But you can't define property differently for the -- for the two provisions of the capital gains section -- but now, I can clarify this somewhat I think by -- 117 (j), the part of the difficulty is, serves three entirely different purposes and I think I can show you that it had nothing to do with this kind of problem of -- of the kinds of interest that are involved in the -- in the disposition or conversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.256" offset="3496417">Now, the first purpose of 117 (j) which was added in 1942, the first purpose related to the treatment as a capital asset of property -- of depreciable property used in the trade or business, machines, buildings and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.143" offset="3567992">Now, before 117 (j) as of now, 117 (a) had excluded such property from the definition of capital assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.172" offset="3612087">The reason for that was to allow businesses to take ordinary loss deductions when they sold property that had been depreciated and part of this was justified on the ground that the loss probably represented inadequate depreciation deductions in the past and they ought to be allowed to recover that in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.475" offset="3705292">Now, in 1942, Congress was prevailed upon and persuaded that that was no reason not to treat as capital gains, any gain on the sale of depreciable business property.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.079" offset="3763702">So that was the main purpose of 117 (j), was to have preserving the capital of the ordinary loss treatment on sale of the business property to grant capital gains treatment on a gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.217" offset="3812289">In effect, it made business property, depreciable business property, capital assets par excellence.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.796" offset="3834546">They're capital assets for gain purposes, but not for loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.165" offset="3848025">Now, the second problem -- the second purpose which is most relevant here was to extend the same kind of preferential treatment to losses arising involuntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.837" offset="3902673">Now, most involuntary conversions do qualify its sales or exchanges -- a condemnation does in foreclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.540" offset="3949484">Before 117 (j), all such involuntary conversions that qualified as sales or exchanges were treated as capital transactions, both loss and gain wise as capital gain or capital loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.198" offset="4016149">Of the -- the thought seems to have been that it was unfair not to allow a full deduction for a loss that's involuntarily incurred by a condemnation or seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.851" offset="4066826">The main purpose of the involuntary conversion provision in 117 (j) is to allow full deduction of the loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.339" offset="4100681">We say it didn't change at all the problem of -- when you're entitled to capital gain treatment on gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.982" offset="4139342">And I should say that there is finally one of the other minor purposes served by this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.596" offset="4169749">There were some kinds of involuntary conversions that did not qualify as sales or exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.569" offset="4197648">Primarily that was the destruction of a house and the receipt of insurance proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.711" offset="4218232">That was not a sale or exchange, now that produced the anomalous result that if I sold a house, $50,000, I had capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.695" offset="4246131">To a burn down, I get $50,000 insurance, it was ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.174" offset="4264103">One purpose was to overcome that by treating that kind of conversion also as one giving rise to capital gain and under the preferential loss provisions of 117 (j), loss in the case of a loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.853" offset="4326797">Now, we think none of those purposes of 117 (j) go at all to the problem of what kinds of interest have to be converted in order to give rise to capital gains, i.e., what Congress meant by property used in that section and used in 117 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.648" offset="4401925">And we think that the -- the terms mean the same thing in the two sections in (j) and (a) and the question of, if the interest is of such duration that upon a sale of it would not give rise to capital gain, then likewise when an involuntary conversion of it, it does not give rise to capital gains.</text>

            <text syncTime="1186.628" offset="4849873">Prior to now and these cases in the lower court, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue had resisted what they apparently now, concede before this Court and that is that there was a taking and that there was an involuntary conversion and that the award was not received as anything except rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.164" offset="4932002">I take it now that they concede that the amount received was merely measured by rental value which, of course, is exactly what the Motor Carriers Claims Commission held and, of course, it's obvious under the Fifth Amendment, award cannot be as a result of income, it has to be something that is awarded on account of a property interest converted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.483" offset="5033253">Now, what the Government is claiming here is exactly the same thing that they claimed before the Motor Carriers Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.495" offset="5061360">And in the petitions to that Commission which was set up specifically by Congress for the purpose of hearing these claims, the -- each of these 103 carriers claim that the Government took their property and the answer of the Government in each and everyone of these cases was there was no taking of the petitioner's property under the Fifth Amendment and the Motor Carriers Commission held that each and everyone of these cases that as of 1201, on August 12, 1941, the petitioner's property, its transportation system, all of its properties were taken for public use by the United States, which require the payment of just compensation under the Fifth Amendment and I think, of course, that this is not the place to go and do whether the amount of the award was too low or too large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.086" offset="5263757">At least that was determined by this Commission specifically set up for that purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1334.669" offset="5442017">Now, that also was a -- was a claim that the Government made before the Motor Carriers Commission and the Motor Carriers Commission specifically passed on that question and doing so it stated, “The Government says that such interference this petitioner may have encountered from government action did not amount to a taking of its property, but merely to regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.421" offset="5525086">To place any such construction on the said acts done by the federal manager would be to belie the statements contained in the Executive Order and the orders issued there under.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.763" offset="5566464">Now this case, just exactly like cases that this Court considered during World War II, where there was federal seizure of the coal mines for instance in the John L.
