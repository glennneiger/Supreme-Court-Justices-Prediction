            <text syncTime="414.389" offset="1760946">And he expressed the view which we share that the requirement of the fixing upon a leaflet to be distributed anywhere in the City of Los Angeles of the names and addresses, both of the author and the distributor, was not merely as he put it a technical requirement but was a -- a serious inroad upon freedom of expression.</text>

            <text syncTime="478.964" offset="2019244">The majority of the Court may know reference to them but Judge Bishop did and he said in his opinion, it appears in the record at 35 that one who sees an evil, it's in the -- it's in the mid-paragraph on page 35, and I shall quote it, “One who sees an evil against which he would strike by written criticism will refrain from doing so because of what he believes to be sure consequences to himself and family if his name appears on the panel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="511.982" offset="2151320">In other words, therefore, we are talking about, at least Judge bishop was, of sure consequences which befalls a person who distributes a leaflet in behalf of a minority group, protesting racial discrimination in the City of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.066" offset="2215685">And then he went on to say, the right freely to use the printed word is not limited to those so moved that they will act regardless of the consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.202" offset="2252152">In just another moment, I want to discuss with Your Honors what these consequences are.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.120" offset="2271901">In short, Judge Bishop took a view, a view which we share that freedom of the press including, of course, distribution of leaflets, is not limited to heroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.222" offset="2316309">It is not only for the stout of heart but is also for the timid and the faint hearted.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.166" offset="2348074">Now, that leads me to answer Your Honor -- Justice Whittaker's question more specifically and more directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.770" offset="2382451">We have, as an appendix to our reply brief, referred to reports made by an official agency of the County of Los Angeles, an agency appointed, it -- the matter refer -- it appears at page -- at page 12 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.831" offset="2458728">We have referred to findings and comments made by an official agency of the County of Los Angeles appointed by the Board of Supervisors of the County pursuant to an official ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.912" offset="2507003">I may say to Your Honors and particularly to Justice Frankfurter that what he have done here, is followed a pattern which was used in the Beauharnais case, in the Beauharnais case, the Court, through Mr. Justice Frankfurter, referred to findings by a Commission of the City of Chicago on human relations with respect to racial tensions in that community, indeed, there is a memorandum filed in that case as to racial tensions relying upon the findings made by that Commission and the memorandum indicates that it was filed at the request of Justice Frankfurter during the oral argument and also the suggestion of -- of Justice Black.</text>

            <text syncTime="1371.221" offset="5588302">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.911" offset="5603035">Now, it's conceded by the City that the distribution of noncommercial handbills is a constitutionally protected right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.851" offset="5642742">This is so, it is our contention that anonymity is also entitled to constitutional protection since anonymity may be necessary for the circulation of speech and ideas and hence to the exercise of a First Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.610" offset="5729782">Now, historically, there are practical and historic uses of anonymity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.807" offset="5766562">It has always been or frequently has been invoked to protect the speaker and the author from reprisal during the struggle for religious liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.890" offset="5810970">Anonymity was vital to the expression of ideas if only to gain entrance to the forum of opinion and if only to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.865" offset="5862797">Now, very frequently, the churches of those days attempted to expose heretics by requiring that the names be put to what they right and much the same fashion as this ordinance has drawn here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.780" offset="5926536">Even today, the non-conformant -- non-conformant as the heretic has frequently found it necessary to foster his ideas anonymously in order that he may be heard and indeed in order that he may earn a livelihood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.748" offset="5986408">I have reference to the fact that we find it a common practice for blacklisted writers in the entertainment industry to -- to write anonymously or under a fictitious name in order to earn a livelihood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.778" offset="6050461">So, here are some practical consequences of the use of anonymity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.052" offset="6071568">But in any event, we contend, that it remains for the author and for the speaker to set the conditions under which he will speak or express his ideas that if he is going to -- go into the market place of ideas to -- to buy for the contention for -- for public acceptance of his idea, it must be left to him to -- to decide whether he will incur the risk of facing a hostile community, that community hostile to his ideas anonymously or by identifying himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1844.572" offset="7481657">For example, a leaflet circulated by -- is (Inaudible) would have a decidedly different import than the same remarks decimated by Robert Hutchins or Cardinal Newman or (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.469" offset="7529200">Now, I simply suggest an answer to that contention, Your Honor, that this is not the kind societal interest which may justify this ordinance because if you're going to clear up the market place of ideas with names vying for contention instead of ideas, then people will begin to look to who said what rather than to what they themselves should be believing and listening to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.136" offset="7627943">Now, it's our contention further, Your Honor, that in connection with some of these other areas where the City, where the States, where the Congress has in certain -- certain circumstances required disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.131" offset="7687920">As for example, in the Harriss case which this Court recently had before it involving the -- the involving the question of requiring a lobbyist to disclose his -- his affiliations with the organization that he was representing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.258" offset="7752391">There again, we're dealing with a -- an individual who is paid to influence legislation and who is influencing legislation directly with the -- with the legislator involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.294" offset="7812577">And I call attention to the fact that in this particular instance, not only was Congress limiting itself to a specific evil but indeed, in order to preserve the constitutionality of that particular statute, this Court found it necessary to further limit the scope of that particular statute so as not to impinge upon the dissemination of ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.020" offset="7915499">The City has also made reference to another area where disclosure may be required and that is the area involving corrupt practices whereby States, like, incidentally, California, Section 5005 of the education -- of the Elections Code which requires that the -- which requires that the circulator of a pamphlet or of a hand bill identify himself and his name and his address, where his bill is aimed at the defeat of a candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.969" offset="8059277">Here again, the -- the States involved are aimed at preserving other fundamental freedoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.896" offset="8086967">And again, is limited narrowly to a particular evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.480" offset="8105253">But what we suggest here is that there is no valid basis once you have conceded that, as in this particular pamphlet, that advocacy of an idea is lawful that that particular individual who disseminates that idea should have the right to determine for himself the conditions under which he will advocate that particular idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.996" offset="8195323">And he has chosen here to advocate it anonymously perhaps, because of the reasons, Mr. Wirin's suggests or perhaps, for his own -- for other reasons which -- which he may have determined, which I don't think our -- our particular important as long as he has not expressed an idea which -- which affronts the ordinance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2327.366" offset="9412838">It has been stated by members of this Court in various cases, the First Amendment to the Constitution embraces two concepts, first, freedom to believe and second, freedom to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.927" offset="9467068">The first is absolute but in the nature of things, the second cannot be conduct remaining subject to regulation for the protection of the society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.086" offset="9507715">Over a period of time and in accordance with the various opinions rendered by this Court, and other appellate courts, the City of Los Angeles has attempted to regulate the exercise of that right in connection with free speech and press in order to protect the general public from various evils which have from time to time become apparent to the members of the City Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.109" offset="9623803">This Court may recall in 1939, in Schneider versus Irvington, a California -- a Los -- a Los Angeles City ordinance was involved in the Kim Young section of that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.849" offset="9670719">Thereafter, that ordinance was amended to comply with the opinions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.235" offset="9692348">The original ordinance was broad, prohibiting the circulation of any type of handbill within the City upon public streets or parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.339" offset="9724740">Thereafter, it was amended to only cover the commercial handbills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.796" offset="9742608">In other series of ordinances were reexamined that had been on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.547" offset="9761520">Some of them related to the distribution of commercial handbills to automobiles getting out on the streets and interfering with traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.387" offset="9800913">Another type of an ordinance dealt with going onto private property where the tenant had play or posted signs stating that, no advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.470" offset="9841246">In accordance with the various opinions rendered, we reenacted all our ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.042" offset="9863502">In order to answer Justice -- Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion, the legislative history and municipalities and cities, of course, is very lenient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.745" offset="9906343">We were able to find out that prior to 1931, an effort was made by the local Chamber of Commerce, urging the City Council to do something about these handbills and advertising matters which were false and misleading, had no names of sponsors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.446" offset="9981158">They were particularly interested in the fictitious name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.444" offset="9993174">They said, “Who are these people that are distributing, who are advertising, doing things of that sort?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.497" offset="10021386">The legal record that were able to find indicates that a request from the Council to the City Attorney as to their legal opinion on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.589" offset="10065690">The City Attorney wrote back and formed a conclusion that distribution of handbills, pamphlets or other matters, without the name of the fictitious firm or officers would be legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.342" offset="10124727">Thereafter, in the early part of 1932, an ordinance was drafted, submitted to the City Council and approved by then which related to the original subject, unlawful for any person, firm or association to distribute in the City of Los Angeles and the advertisement or handbill or any other matter which does not have the names of the sponsors or of such literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.675" offset="10234023">Then in 1936, the various ordinances were reenacted into a code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.449" offset="10257220">At that time, the word “commercial” was left out were it had said commercial handbill or advertising, so that the ordinances remained on the books since originally 1932 to 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.813" offset="10314585">Then I might say that this is -- the Talley case is the second case that has ever come before any of the courts is -- on the appellate level.</text>
