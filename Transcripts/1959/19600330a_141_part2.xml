            <text syncTime="85.854" offset="446777">That is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.210" offset="448240">The concept of depreciation subsumes within it, not simply physical deterioration, but any other operative cause which results in lowering the period -- lessening the period of usefulness to the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.034" offset="511457">In the Munitions case, it was the cessasion of demand because of the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.138" offset="531937">In -- in other cases, it was the power plant's inadequacy to fulfill the needs the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.573" offset="557641">In this case, it is the inability of a three year old car to be offered for rent because customers demand more recent cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.094" offset="591705">In all of these situations and there are a host to them, I've only mentioned a few.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.371" offset="612812">All of these external causes, unconnected with physical wear and tear, have been taken into account as they bear upon a particular facts and circumstances pertaining to the taxpayer's situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.204" offset="672162">Now, this is also a concept which has been well recognized in the accounting predecease from the earliest days in Kester, on accounting, a 1925 edition.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.176" offset="720123">In discussing the various factors in depreciation and scrap value Kester says, “There is a close relation between the operation of the chief factors and depreciation on the scrap value of the asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.381" offset="768920">Thus, if it is estimated that physical depreciation will be complete in eight years, obsolescence in 10 years and inadequacy in 12 years, scrap value would be slight.”</text>
            <text syncTime="176.818" offset="810611">Yes, because physical depreciation have already have run in its course.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.465" offset="825240">If however, inadequacy is the controlling factor such as in this case, becoming operative in eight years with obsolescence in 10 years and physical depreciation in 12 years, clearly scrap value might be quite appreciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.763" offset="882395">It would be quite appreciable, of course, because when the taxpayer disposes of it after of it's inadequate for his business, full physical depreciation hasn't run its course, so it's available for use by other businesses, my other taxpayers.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.793" offset="1250513">And the rule that all the economic factors must be taken into an account is designed to assure that cost and no more than cost is to be recovered.</text>

            <text syncTime="295.748" offset="1286353">Now, Mr. Heffron, they say, as you say a -- a dramatic illustration of the inequity that you say exists, but it's -- and perhaps in the automobile business, it's fairly unusual, but it's not unheard of elsewhere is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="312.097" offset="1351764">I've just -- for example, in -- in business real estate, real estate held for rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.697" offset="1386141">It's depreciable according of what it's made of and when it was built and so on, let's say 50 years, at a straight line depreciation that's 2% a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.518" offset="1421458">But it's -- it's quite usual, isn't it, in these kind -- these of days and this kind of economic picture for you -- for a -- for an owner to be able to depreciate that from cost 20% or 30 % and then actually sell it at a profit over cost?</text>
            <text syncTime="344.184" offset="1480077">That's not unheard of, is it?</text>

            <text syncTime="345.120" offset="1483839">Well, that -- that can happen because we're dealing here with estimates and probabilities based on past experience and there's a -- there's a good deal of room here for -- within the area of what a reasonable estimate is.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.863" offset="1538800">I think that's the reason for that, but the concept, for example with buildings, buildings maybe held to be subject to a lesser amount -- to a shorter life than otherwise, because it is anticipated that there will be changes in the neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.085" offset="1595747">That would be one economic factor not related to physical wear and tear, which cuts down his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.962" offset="1615182">That's a common occurrence in the case of real estate, but in the few minutes I have remaining, I wanted to point out to the Court the extraordinary proposition we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.401" offset="1648933">The concept that all economic forces must be taken into account, to reduce the useful life of the taxpayer, has been applied in a wide variety of cases and industries, in the power industry, as I've cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.161" offset="1700028">In the munitions industry, in real estate, in every other type of -- of business which is conducted, the taxpayer's proposition then, must come down to this, that despite the fact -- despite the fact that those rules have been consistently applied and all these other cases, we, in the auto rental business, are entitled to a different rule, because of the Commissioner's practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.410" offset="1805040">Now, this is an extraordinary proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.164" offset="1819982">It is not a contention that the regulations are invalid, because they are unreasonable, because they are not inconformity with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.545" offset="1849553">Indeed, the 1954 Regulations are precisely in point here and specifically set forth the concept of useful life and salvage value, for which the Government contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.497" offset="1889364">So this is an extraordinary proposition, says these regulations are invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.009" offset="1907440">It says all this history of application and under -- other industries, may not be applied to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.278" offset="1928443">It's an extraordinary contention and of course, it results in a very great discrimination among taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.201" offset="1952162">All other taxpayers can only depreciate upon the basis of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.460" offset="1969194">Taxpayers in the car rental business, if these taxpayers sustain, can depreciate on a basis other that cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.265" offset="1996466">They can convert ordinary income in the capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.706" offset="2006183">Irrespective of the cost, the taxpayer who sells a car for $100 more than he pays or it, can deduct $600 or $800 in depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.019" offset="2039411">No one else is entitled to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.205" offset="2048188">Now, in one of the taxpayer got what does he offer this Court to demonstrate that this sort of discrimination should be applied?</text>
            <text syncTime="498.112" offset="2095835">He doesn't have 65% of the auto leasing industry in support, because as our evidence brief shows, the Automobile Leasing Association, which represents 65% of the industry, has stated that they are fully in agreement with the Government's position and that that has always been the rule and the practice and that they support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.748" offset="2182353">So he doesn't have that.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.683" offset="2190085">He doesn't have any specific cases which deal with the precise issue presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.690" offset="2214118">He has a good many cases in which taxpayers traded in from time to time, cars and he says, “Well, since they, in fact, traded in the cars, why didn't you cut down their useful life?”</text>
            <text syncTime="538.293" offset="2256541">The answer is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.224" offset="2264273">We don't cut down useful life simply because in fact, the car has been traded in or disposed of in a shorter period.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.340" offset="2292694">Depreciation is based upon experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.624" offset="2301889">We cut it down because past experience relating to this economic factor as it does, as past experience governs the application of all of it, economic factors is the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.797" offset="2350582">Now, it is true, we haven't by some IBM method, pulled all the returns of all the taxpayers in the car rental business who has ever taken depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.115" offset="2395826">On the other hand, the taxpayer hasn't shown any specific car rental cases dealing with the contention of useful life, which he asserts the -- the Government made in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.698" offset="2438144">And as a matter of fact, the peculiar mathematics of it may -- may illustrate a very good reason why the question may not have been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.856" offset="2466774">If a taxpayer takes a four-year useful life and in fact, disposes of the car in two years, he's taken half the value.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.774" offset="2498435">Well, if in fact, he disposes of it in two years and when he sells it, receives half the value, no matter with -- which method of computation you use, the Government's or the taxpayer's, the result is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.744" offset="2550366">Because in fact, under the taxpayer's method, he's taken 50% of the full price of the car, under the Government's method, he has taken all of the spread between the price of the car and the sales proceed which is precisely the same figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.382" offset="2624867">If the car is $2000 and he takes 50% on a four-year useful life, he's deducted $1000 in depreciation.</text>

            <text syncTime="793.437" offset="3277093">The taxpayer's theory cannot result in the recovery of cost, unless purely by accident, when the taxpayer disposes of his property in two years, it happens to be at 50% if the taxpayer was taking four year life at 25% each year.</text>

            <text syncTime="835.753" offset="3446366">He -- he blinds himself to these factors making the recovery of course -- of cost an absolutely hit on this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.236" offset="3476355">The reason he does that is quite clear, because to the extent he can ignore reality and take larger depreciation deductions below cost, to that extent, he can convert ordinary income into capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.372" offset="3532884">Now, the situation is exaggerated under the 1954 Code because of the accelerated methods of depreciation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1148.424" offset="4697109">Well, if I -- on the retroactive point, the District judge said in his findings that he found that the practice started out precisely as the Government contends it did and he referred to the Mr. Justice Brandeis in the Ludey case and he reached the same conclusion the Government does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.944" offset="4767117">However, he found that by 1942, there had been a change and useful life began to mean what the taxpayers said it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.519" offset="4801494">Therefore, by 1954, it had that meaning however, he found the 1954 Code changed that rule, changed it in a way that we support the Government's position back to what it had been originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.290" offset="4852485">He said therefore, the new regulations cannot be retroactively applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.722" offset="4870248">Well, the answer to that is, think that under the decisions of this Court, where a statute, a new statute has been enacted regardless of the old practice, if the statute is new and not the same as the old statute, the old regulations are not carried along with it for purposes of the new statute and where there has been a new statute, a regulation which is promulgated a few years after the new statute maybe retroactively applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.982" offset="4983306">That is what we understand the retroactive contention to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.203" offset="5000234">But in terms of the basic contention here, it has been that the regulations have always been directed to the end of recovery of cost, the 1954 Regulations were explicit, but they simply embodied the practice which had grown up and applied in all these other instances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.843" offset="5338781">Firstly, under Regulation (Inaudible) (l)-1, you would find this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.385" offset="5356962">The proper allowance for such depreciation in that amount which should be set aside for the taxable year in accordance with the reason of the consistent plan, not necessarily a uniformed rate, whereby the aggregate of the amount so set aside, plus the salvage value, will at the end of the useful life of the depreciable property, equal to cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.262" offset="5440449">Now, that phrase, “the useful life for the property,” appears again in that portion of that regulation, Section 4, which is reproduced on the page 39, reading the capitals own brief to be replaced by depreciation allowance, is the cost for all the basis of the property in respect of which the allowance is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.971" offset="5523205">Then further in Section 5, the deduction for depreciation in respect to any of depreciable property for any taxable year shall be limited to such ratable amount is -- may reason it be necessary to recover during the remaining -- remaining useful life of the property, the unrecovered cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.038" offset="5595512">Take that if you will, together with both of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.883" offset="5610872">And I think it's at page 45, that bulletin, which specifically refers to automobiles and tells (Inaudible) that out of the general guide, as the published policy of the Treasury Department, acting through his bureau then, Bureau of Internal Revenue, that if you have passenger cars, five years, salesmen cost three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.696" offset="5694151">So my company elected to use the three year, except for what in that bulletin have.</text>
