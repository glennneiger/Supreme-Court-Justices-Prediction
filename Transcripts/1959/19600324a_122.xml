            <text syncTime="20.847" offset="186807">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.838" offset="206764">I represent here two of the petitioners who were tried at the same time as Schaffers.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.965" offset="231215">I yielded part of my time to Mr. Kossman because he was treating questions common to both of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.840" offset="258696">I now wish to treat something which is in our brief, petitioners Marco and Karp, and that is the deprivation of a fair trial which we claim and sue because of the summation, the improper summation of the District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.408" offset="341034">I must confess it was a queer feeling, as I've said here before and hear myself quoted and to hear questions about why I did thus and so at the trial and casting about the reasons -- the only reasons I could think of it would appear would be either an aptitude or deviousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.139" offset="415953">And as Mark Twain said, "If it weren't for the honor of the thing, he would just as soon pass it up to mention."</text>
            <text syncTime="85.664" offset="446046">But I have to rest on the record as it is because I didn't make those motions at the time and Your Honors will draw whatever inferences you feel proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.780" offset="490454">But in one respect, I did make a motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.115" offset="507800">And I made a motion for mistrial at the time of the summation by the District Attorney, had brought to his honor's attention what it felt was an improper statement prejudicial to my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.107" offset="551790">And at the trial, I represented only one client.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.793" offset="562552">Here, I represent two because that man from West Virginia just couldn't go on with the case unless I'm willing to take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.937" offset="591078">And since there were no conflict of interest and my other client consented I'm here for both.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.732" offset="622320">What he said was an answer to what I said, and in order to put this in proper focus, I must tell you what I said.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.911" offset="658996">And that brings me in a full circle to what the facts are about.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.746" offset="678327">This case involved one where three people, Mario Stracuzza, Anthony Stracuzza and Dorothy Stracuzza were engaged in stealing packages from trucks in the garment district and selling them on a very large scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.502" offset="749380">In fact, the largest of the scale was so amazing, it's like the Purloined Letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.040" offset="771532">I mean you put it right out in the open and nobody thinks there's anything wrong with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.119" offset="791803">They had an office with a name on it, not a telephone and credit bill heads and invoices and a checking account.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.292" offset="824508">They held themselves out as a discount house or a job as outlet on which there are many in the garment area.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.832" offset="850735">They bought about a half million dollars worth of packages a year from these thieves.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.022" offset="871424">They had numerous customers of which these people are only a few.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.820" offset="890650">They kept books of account, they mailed invoices, they were paid by check, and they sent their things out through the railway express, which is the way our people received them.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.099" offset="931819">They were open for business from morning to night where people came in from a street and from recommendations and bought from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.732" offset="966301">And the Stracuzzas, who operated in this way for a lengthy period, were all indicted by the Federal Government in three cases, one, for conspiracy and the one you've heard about in the joinder problem, one for another conspiracy, the phrase had posed it, and another where they were in conspiracy with all of the package thieves, dozens of them, drivers of trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.294" offset="1076537">And all three cases, Mario and Anthony, two of them, pleaded guilty but their sentences were held over their heads until they should have completed testimony in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.116" offset="1139858">Dorothy Stracuzza, who was the wife of Anthony, was not required to plead.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.349" offset="1168802">After this plea and after the Stracuzzas had come to the conclusion that the Government had the goods on them, both men said, "We're going to cooperate with the Government."</text>
            <text syncTime="279.906" offset="1223032">And they started to talk with the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.590" offset="1237765">After this soul-cleansing operation began and after they had changed their stripes, so to speak, they were both picked up again for more package thefts and indicted in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.266" offset="1288443">And the District Attorney and the Federal Government hide themselves across the street to make representations to the judge and the prosecutor of the state court that this man, as my witness, placed off, disposed of this case until after we use him in our case.</text>

            <text syncTime="374.865" offset="1602853">Just as a matter of curiosity, did it appear how long they carried on this kind of business?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harris_b_steinberg" startTime="378.966" stopTime="759.544">
            <label>Mr. Harris B. Steinberg</label>
            <text syncTime="378.966" offset="1619257">I would say they carried on for a considerable period before these defendants here were involved, and I think that appears in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.237" offset="1656351">It was a matter of many months, if Your Honor please.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.007" offset="1667427">Now, let me come to something the Chief Justice asked me before.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.860" offset="1686862">There is not an iota, there is in fact the Government's own witness, principal witness, Tony Stracuzza said, "I never told any of my customers including these, that the stuff was stolen."</text>
            <text syncTime="410.045" offset="1743600">So they relied on circumstantial evidence as Mr. Kossman told you.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.054" offset="1759587">Now, what was the circumstantial evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="417.739" offset="1774320">You mentioned, Your Honor, these invoices.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.810" offset="1786650">I'd like you to look at the invoices.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.354" offset="1796786">They were invoices with the tops taken off so you couldn't tell who was the sender.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.137" offset="1823953">There were invoices with the consignee scribbled out illegibly so you couldn't tell but you could see an identifying stock number perhaps, the quantity and the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.957" offset="1875153">Now, a discount house or a job that operates in exactly that way if he's handling the goods of some highly styled conscious manufacturer who wants to sell his goods for $20 or loose cash in the field, he doesn't like a discount house selling those same goods to someone else for $19 or for $18 or $12.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.148" offset="1959999">But sometimes you have broken lots, there are a few sizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.177" offset="1972120">There are undesired colors and in this Jungle at Seventh Avenue, this is a common, accepted widespread practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.144" offset="2007960">So when you look at the circumstances which were relied upon in this case to fasten circumstantial evidence of guilty knowledge on this man, what do we find?</text>
            <text syncTime="486.246" offset="2048397">You find these invoices.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.307" offset="2056652">You find various other things but let me tell you what else you find.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.998" offset="2071385">You find that Dorothy Stracuzza, the wife under indictment, who worked in the office with her husband and her brother-in-law from morning until night, was the one who prepared the invoices, shall we say, she's any better or worse off than the one who received them?</text>
            <text syncTime="508.543" offset="2137527">Either one.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.829" offset="2142647">She kept the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.919" offset="2151006">No one said that my client kept any books.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.948" offset="2163127">She got the checks, she mailed out the invoices, and she tore off the labels and she put the tickets on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.275" offset="2188518">So if there was any invidious inference to be drawn from these circumstances, I submit to Your Honors that that had been in this inference is at least as worthy against Mrs. Stracuzza as against any of these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.077" offset="2247659">Yet what do we find?</text>
            <text syncTime="538.953" offset="2259153">Mrs. Stracuzza was never called as a witness, either at the package thieves' trial or in our trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.525" offset="2293426">And in fact, shortly after our trial and shortly after our sentence, the District Attorney prepared and signed and submitted to the Court nolle prosequi in all the cases against the lady.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.911" offset="2343058">And they are set forth in the record here, if Your Honors please, at pages -- I thought I was going to do this with a flourish but I have to look.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.963" offset="2403244">At pages 12 -- at page 12 of the record, and what do they say?</text>
            <text syncTime="585.002" offset="2443368">They say that Dorothy Stracuzza has admitted assisting her husband in this business but has denied that she had knowledge of the fact that the merchandize handled by her husband was stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.964" offset="2487254">The defendant Anthony Stracuzza in his testimony as a witness for the Government stated that his wife Dorothy never knew the extent of the operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.093" offset="2519751">As a result of that, that representation by the Government shortly after the completion of this trial, shortly after she had not been called or subjected to cross-examination, on that representation, the cases against her were thrown out.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.729" offset="2574294">Now, what are the facts that this record discloses?</text>
            <text syncTime="621.325" offset="2588714">At this trial, her husband, Tony, was under cross-examination by myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.691" offset="2614105">I asked him, "Did your wife know that these things were stolen?"</text>
            <text syncTime="631.171" offset="2628106">He said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.735" offset="2638346">And then I confronted him with his testimony at the prior trial where he had sworn under oath that his wife had known all about it, and he said, "Yes, I did testify to that effect."</text>
            <text syncTime="644.093" offset="2679724">I said, "What is the truth now?</text>
            <text syncTime="645.401" offset="2684949">Is that or is it this?"</text>
            <text syncTime="647.792" offset="2694562">He said, "Well, if you press me, I'll have to say she didn't know it."</text>
            <text syncTime="651.331" offset="2708668">Well, we left it at that because the truth wasn't in Tony Stracuzza and I wasn't trying to get the truth from him but I was trying to show what a liar he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.848" offset="2742732">Because for three days, I cross-examined that man to show he was a liar and I elicited the facts that he was a thief for many, many years, that he had a huge quantity of money and property not accountable for by any endeavor that he had ever reported to the income tax people.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.001" offset="2811382">That he was a gambler, a loan shark and whatever you will, and he admitted a lot of these cheerfully and in fact boastfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.340" offset="2848684">I would say that at the end of his cross-examination, he didn't look as cheerful as he did at the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.503" offset="2869373">I don't say that in vainglory of my powers as a cross-examiner, I say it for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.863" offset="2890794">Because we then expected that they would bring Mario around, the other brother for cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.424" offset="2913050">And the reason Mario was important, was first, because he had testified at the -- at the State's trial and second, the Government had represented to the State District Attorney and the state court judge across the street"Please hold up Mario's sentence because he is a necessary material witness at this trial"</text>
            <text syncTime="726.088" offset="3007718">But they never produced him.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.281" offset="3020466">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="730.172" offset="3024018">Because they didn't want him cross-examined, because he was the man who went out and bought this stuff from the thieves.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.438" offset="3053171">Tony said, "I didn't buy from the thieves, it was Mario."</text>
            <text syncTime="741.129" offset="3067904">Mario went out everyday with a pocket full of cash, $1000 to $1500 everyday and came back with packages and dumped them on the desk and Dorothy took the packages apart, stripped the labels off, put tickets on, did all the busy, homely, friendly little things that people do with packaging.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harris B. Steinberg</label>
            <text syncTime="760.494" offset="3145331">But they didn't bring Mario out for cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.746" offset="3162363">And I say that it was our defense and it was our contention from the opening consistently through the trial right through the summation that there was a hope for a deal, I'll put it as euphemistically as I can, I'll say that the Stracuzzas hoped to be benefited by their change of heart, by their cooperation with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.801" offset="3246582">And the hope was (a), that Tony wouldn't go to jail, (b) that Mario wouldn't go to jail and (c), that Dorothy wouldn't go to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.058" offset="3283571">And their hopes were realized to the fullest extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.976" offset="3295274">Not only were they indicted here in three cases, not only they pleaded guilty in three cases except for Dorothy, but they got suspended sentences and across the street in a state court where the people are cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.792" offset="3346578">And they use that cooperative, in the same sense in which they used it in the Knapp against Schweitzer case in a very friendly sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.007" offset="3379388">They -- the -- they gave him a suspended sentence too.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.254" offset="3392345">So here, you have the three Stracuzzas with their half million dollar yearly business in stolen goods and sold stupendously large scale that would stagger the imagination going off free, scot free because Tony gave his testimony and withstood the cross-examination for three days in a little braggy but he was still there, and they thought it would be the better part avow not to put Mario on and they were gentlemanly enough not to subject Dorothy to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.970" offset="3523271">In addition, what else did that accomplish?</text>
            <text syncTime="857.374" offset="3532884">When Dorothy and Mario were arrested, Dorothy had $900 -- $1900 in cash on her person and Mario had $900 in cash on his person.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.383" offset="3576874">And from the previous testimony, it was quite clear that that was a sort of money and the type of money they were using everyday to go out and buy stolen stuff with.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.877" offset="3606862">And the Government seized it as evidence and impounded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.838" offset="3618774">But after they began to cooperate, it was given back to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.998" offset="3635388">I wanted to cross-examine about that too but I couldn't because he didn't call Mario, they didn't call Dorothy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1098.325" offset="4496697">Three things, although I say three things for the purpose of handling it easily and for the purpose of relating with the cases, he said one thing because the whole thing is in a short compass and I jumped up and I said I want a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.750" offset="4554376">Now, the first thing he said, what Mr. Steinberg says, "Where is Dorothy Stracuzza?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.320" offset="4596694">And he says, "I'm telling you that Dorothy Stracuzza is still a defendant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.989" offset="4627310">The case is still pending against her.</text>

            <text syncTime="1138.811" offset="4658657">Now, I say to Your Honors in the context of what was in preparation, in the context of that statement in the nolle prosequi that was filed shortly thereafter, in a context of accepting that nolle prosequi the denial by -- by Tony of his wife's guilt knowing that Tony had said something just to the contrary under oath and not pointing that in nolle prosequi, in the context of her own denial of guilt but with all the admitted circumstances and far more than we used to fasten guilt on these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.976" offset="4819257">I say that was as phony as a $3 bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.218" offset="4832214">I say that was a misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.362" offset="4844857">I say that does not accord with the high purpose and principles of a prosecutor and I say that that was improper and deprived my clients of a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.585" offset="4893759">What else did he say?</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.288" offset="4920508">He said this to the other defendant Mario, "It is the Government's representation to you,"</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.896" offset="4942973">That he could have proffered nothing in a way of additional evidence that was not presented to you through to his brother because if you will recall from the testimony of Agent Miller, both Stracuzzas were interviewed on each and every occasions by him, the story, the testimony, if you will, given to the FBI was a joint story and therefore, the testimony of Mario Stracuzza, if he will call to testify, would be in a sense a repetition of all the details that you heard from the witness Anthony Stracuzza.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.027" offset="5059480">I submit to Your Honors that's for me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.932" offset="5071078">That wasn't because he wanted to save the time of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.327" offset="5084662">That wasn't because he wanted to say repetitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.431" offset="5101066">I submit to Your Honors that it's clearly apparent that in view of the search and cross-examination, Mario had undergone at the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.289" offset="5132518">In view of these items of his money in his pocket, in view of the benefits he was getting across the street on this very Court, I say they wanted to protect him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.811" offset="5178598">And that's why that's a misrepresentation although it's proposed to be a representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.166" offset="5200018">And the third thing is and this as I said, tired cliché of advocacy, this quotation of what it says over the Department of Justice, "The Government wins when justice is done of citizens and the Court".</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.266" offset="5256443">That's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.576" offset="5261667">But I don't like to see that used in this captious phony sense and which is used here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.063" offset="5283610">And when I say captious and phony, I could cite to you cases in our brief where the same quotes and the same tired reference that same chiselled thing is made in other occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.975" offset="5323316">What I'm getting at is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.737" offset="5334288">This is not advocacy that heat of passion or something said that they're sorry for a moment later.</text>

            <text syncTime="1353.934" offset="5519130">You have to march right into that jury room and acquit every one of these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.521" offset="5533445">That's what's shoddy about it, Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.898" offset="5542954">The cases, I've cited them in my brief, say that when you take away from a jury the real issue of the guilt or innocence of a defendant and you give them the phony issue of trying this handsome, clean-cut, cultured fine young man for impropriety, no jury is going to want to convict him of impropriety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.439" offset="5617142">Now, when you say to -- when you say to him, "Here's this clean-cut, handsome young boy with a good law school, speaks well," is obviously the kind of board or jurors would be proud to have who he suddenly stands up, they're doing his duty against some people under indictment that if you believe I did anything wrong, I quit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.092" offset="5711705">Now, the Court of Appeals in New York citing the Berger case of this Court says that's bad, it's reversible, dump to it because it's tendering a false issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.460" offset="5749217">Now, I don't know whether Your Honors would have given me certiorari in this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.634" offset="5769906">I don't know whether Your Honors are primarily interested in the points Mr. Kossman talked about, but it was in my heart to bring you this point because the time has come, so many years after the Berger case to get the word around in the federal courts that this is not the way to try a case because the same cliché, the same exact phrases come up in case after case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.714" offset="5858200">Young fellows are learning how to try cases and they think this is the way to try the case unless you tell them differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.009" offset="5883382">From the cases I've cited in my brief, you will find repeated references to Berger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.052" offset="5907623">Berger had a good effect on the New York Court of Appeals in the last five years has had five cases touching on summations, propriety or propriety summations reversed in every case and citing Berger, but it's losing its steam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.599" offset="5973765">And I say to Your Honors you will do a service to the dying out of advocacy if you tell us how to try a case and put teeth into what you tell us, and say, "This is not the way to do it."</text>

            <text syncTime="1539.905" offset="6262993">There's very little that I can say on that.</text>
