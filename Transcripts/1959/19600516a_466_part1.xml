            <text syncTime="30.948" offset="227140">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.776" offset="246471">This case presents the question of whether there is a denial of due process of law for a State to refuse the pretrial request of an 18-year old defendant for the appointment of counsel for his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.203" offset="320136">The record shows that he has only a sixth grade education and no means to employ an attorney and for the State then to proceed to try and convict him on a felony charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.882" offset="394951">The specific charge in the indictment of this case was that of common law robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.401" offset="432985">The conviction was that of larceny from the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.298" offset="456600">Now, by North Carolina law, common law robbery is a felony punishable by a sentence of up to 10 years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.156" offset="495992">And larceny from the person is described as a lesser offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.904" offset="530996">However, the punishment for larceny from the person, which is also a felony, is a maximum of 10 years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.132" offset="571852">Thus, we have the same maximum sentence in either case.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.850" offset="594735">And it would be a lesser offense, as I -- as I view the case only in that there is a lesser quantum of proof required.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.491" offset="633292">Now, the question was raised by the petitioner as appears on page 4 of the record, if you indulge me just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.995" offset="683342">The State was represented at the trial by a solicitor and his assistant.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.920" offset="711032">The petitioner, Hudson, was tried along with -- with two codefendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.754" offset="746350">One of whom, David Cain, had attorney of his own choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.837" offset="774771">The record reads as follows, page 4, State represented by Solicitor Braswell and Assistant Solicitor Blackwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.714" offset="810193">Defendant David Cain represented by Attorney McGeachy.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.836" offset="826702">Other defendants not represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.661" offset="837987">Defendant Larry Hudson, “I don't have funds to employ an attorney and I'm not capable of defending myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.731" offset="874245">If the Court please, I would like to ask the Court to employ me an attorney.”</text>
            <text syncTime="199.147" offset="899950">Atty.Blackwell, “I will say that he is not able to employ an attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.775" offset="1014471">At the conclusion of State's evidence, he was given a suspended sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.597" offset="1029726">Six months suspended on certain conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.317" offset="1044668">The defendant, Hudson, petitioner in this case, was given a sentence of three to five years in the State's prison and the other defendant without a lawyer, Ray Stalling, was given 18 moths to two years, not in the prison, but on the roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.019" offset="1135470">The petitioner in this case filed notice of appeal following his conviction, but the appeal was never perfected and this case was brought here later as a result of a post-conviction proceeding brought under North Carolina law, which involved a petition back to the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.741" offset="1234317">The appointment of counsel by the trial court, a hearing on the allegations of the depravation of constitutional right of counsel and an order was entered following that hearing denying the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.661" offset="1305997">Writ of certiorari was taken to the North Carolina Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.394" offset="1320939">From that order, the North Carolina Supreme Court denied the petition without opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1196.914" offset="4891042">And as of July 1st, another judge would have been holding court in that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.861" offset="4918836">And Judge Heman Clark was the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.655" offset="4930017">Judge Hall, C.W.Hall was holding the courts thereby of the time that the second petition was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.160" offset="4979963">And Judge Hall, as I have noted, had counsel appointed for petitioner at this hearing and went into a consideration of the matter on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.973" offset="5035238">Now, the constitutional question did not attempt to evade it or state that the petitioner had failed to prosecute his appeal or had mistaken his remedy, but he found -- found facts into the judgment which denied it and found that the petitioner had not been deprived of due process of law or did not have any substantial constitutional right through the failure to appoint counsel at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.608" offset="5173791">I might say too that this record -- that the finding of Judge Hall in regard to the representation by David Cain's attorney is interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.702" offset="5222170">This -- this lawyer, at the trial, offered to represent all three defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.398" offset="5248920">He said, “I will take on the other two, Judge, as long as the interest don't conflict.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.064" offset="5275669">And the judge did not make any response at the time, but several pages over in the record, the Court found that the interest of the defendants were beginning to conflict, and he said, “You'd better just represent -- just cross-examine on behalf of your -- your own client, David Cain, and not try to represent the others.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.394" offset="5372949">And Judge Hall in finding 3 stated that N.H. McGeachy Jr., attorney for David Cain told the Court that he would help all three defendants as long as there was no conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.066" offset="5419656">But the Court thought there might be some conflict of interest and Mr. McGeachy represented only the defendant David Cain at said trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1476.479" offset="6009292">In the Wade against Mayo case, the facts were almost identical with those in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.057" offset="6039594">In that case, the petitioner was an 18-year old defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1499.001" offset="6099362">He made a pretrial request for the appointment of counsel, stating that he didn't have the funds to employ a counsel of his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.319" offset="6140635">The Court denied that request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.330" offset="6156727">At the trial, he was advised of his right to cross-examine the witnesses against him and he did avail himself to some extent of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.392" offset="6200926">There were -- but he did not summon any witnesses of his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.249" offset="6224332">He took the stand as did the defendant -- the petitioner in this case and testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.961" offset="6255261">He did not make any argument to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.507" offset="6281383">In that case, the petitioner filed a petition for habeas corpus, and the District Court of Florida found the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.482" offset="6329344">And the Court in that case made a specific finding that the petitioner was unable to represent himself in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.749" offset="6370408">There's nothing to show how much formal education he had had, but the Court was satisfied on the basis of the evidence before it that this petitioner was unable to defend himself adequately in Wade against Mayo and that he should have been granted his request for a counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.600" offset="6465808">Now, the facts in this case bring it almost squarely within the Wade against Mayo doctrine, as I see it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1763.063" offset="7155649">In the Griffin case, the defendant there was denied an appellate review because he didn't get up his bill of exceptions properly and he could have gotten that bill of exceptions together only if he had a copy of the trial transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="1798.799" offset="7298591">Now, the Court -- and this Court has held that due process of law does not require that a State provide an appeal from a conviction or other court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.412" offset="7369017">But if the State thus provide an appellate procedure, it must make that appellate procedure open and available to the indigent defendant as well as the one with means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.511" offset="7429413">An essential ingredient of any hearing, as this Court has held and noted in number of cases starting from Powell against Alabama on down, is there is representation by counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1865.385" offset="7564936">Now, the State of North Carolina, by statute and by Constitution, guarantees to defendants of means the right to represent -- to representation by a counsel.</text>
