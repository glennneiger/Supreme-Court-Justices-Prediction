            <text syncTime="414.398" offset="1760946">It shows the broad expanse of the two giant carriers whom we oppose in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.344" offset="1796786">On the one hand, there is the Pennsylvania Railroad which is far and away the most powerful and largest carrier in the United States in all terms except number of miles of track.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.846" offset="1846732">It has 10,000 miles of track.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.671" offset="1862092">It has a billion dollars a year in freight revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.473" offset="1881213">It has the most concentrated industrial origination territory that the country has.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.393" offset="1924995">It has the plant facility that totals a $1,800,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.032" offset="1951535">It has density a 175% of the average I think it runs 4,240,000 revenue ton miles per a mile of track.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.388" offset="2004929">In addition to that it has a great many subsidiaries, the most important of which for this purpose is the Wabash which is itself is five times the size of Minneapolis and the Wabash is a very important, a very potent, a very effective competitor of the Western as the Court will see.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.347" offset="2088730">It serves the same purpose of joining the east and the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.919" offset="2103045">The Pennsylvania competes with the Western by concentrating on two gateways.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.411" offset="2121017">Its first solicitation is for the St. Louis gateway.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.422" offset="2137109">The second solicitation and next longest call is for Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.285" offset="2152469">It has never solicited for the Peoria gateway.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.107" offset="2167829">Let me say that again because I want to make this perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.215" offset="2184234">Neither the Pennsylvania nor the Santa Fe which now seek to acquire this Western property has ever solicited traffic for this gateway.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.691" offset="2222164">They not only prefer but they concentrate on their own longer haul gateways which are St. Louis and Chicago in the case of Pennsylvania and Chicago and the late case of Santa Fe.</text>

            <text syncTime="672.215" offset="2792260">And the interest of those two carriers in the longer haul competing gateways was such that this gateway dried up and Western went into receivership where it languished for 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.776" offset="2854431">And then it was bought as two strips of west if you please by this man McNear who advised the Commission of the time he made the application to acquire the property that this railroad could never prosper as long as it was -- was in the control of the carriers with whom it had to compete and that was the situation with the Pennsylvania and the Burlington and he demonstrated that very graphically.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.893" offset="2966967">He bought the property in 1927.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.251" offset="2976371">In less than two years, the car loadings went from 38,000 to 68,000 and I might say while the Commission says that there is time at least a time relation between the connection at Lomax with the Santa Fe, and the successive Western, it does not appear in the figures or in the facts, there may be a time connection but no factual connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.247" offset="3080338">Of that 68,000 cars, less than 6000 cars came at that connection and at the same time some Burlington traffic was lost because when that connection was made, the Burlington connection at this point was broken leaving only two other connections with Burlington.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.397" offset="3156929">So the 6000 figure is not a net figure and even that is very small in relation to the total picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.783" offset="3182529">The undisputed fact is and the Commission found that the Pennsylvania and the Santa Fe have offered passive resistance and that's an interesting term because we -- we've come to the language problem in that connection presently.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.451" offset="3241148">I was interested in hearing the opinions of the Court this morning with respect to differences in the use of language that we -- we find that at least two of the railroads in this case had special language of their own and one of the aspects of that special language is this passive resistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.452" offset="3321187">It didn't counter-solicit as they said but they tried to get the business themselves through the St. Louis gateway first for Pennsylvania, Chicago gateway second and through the Chicago gateway for the Santa Fe.</text>

            <text syncTime="1651.242" offset="6708328">For example, we proposed a connection here at Watsinka with Chicago and Eastern Illinois which would open the way to the south and the southeast.</text>

            <text syncTime="1687.926" offset="6855032">So our program contemplated first of all new economies and efficiencies and we estimated by a detailed program submitted to the Commission that a $1,770,000 would be saved by eliminating the duplicate facilities and just to give the Court some idea the magnitude of that in relation to properties as a whole the total expense on the Western is about four million six or seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.275" offset="6968508">Secondly we proposed the accelerated and the added service and the new service routes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2479.503" offset="10021386">Secondly and most important of all, the Pennsylvania-Santa Fe told the Commission, “We're going to put Lomax on a parity with Chicago and Effner on a parity with Chicago for solicitation purposes” and the Commission bought that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Max Swiren</label>
            <text syncTime="2951.716" offset="11910248">He favored the acquisition by Minneapolis and St. Louis until May 26, 1955, the date when the second contract was made to sell the property to Santa Fe and then Santa Fe to Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.406" offset="11965001">Up until that point, he favored that Minneapolis acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.294" offset="11976600">After that he said, he favored the acquisition by the new proposed owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.885" offset="12010872">At 1600, he was asked whether under these conditions with the influence of the Pennsylvania add anything to the influence now being exerted by the PP&amp;W in Santa Fe on a movement across the Peoria gateway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.157" offset="12084015">He said, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.338" offset="12088717">Question - why not?</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.028" offset="12095509">Because as I said before, this benevolent influence of the Pennsylvania was truly after a gateway which is present policy but they want their haul to Chicago or St. Louis which includes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.164" offset="12136051">And then on 1609, he was asked, “In what way do you distinguish between parity and having the benevolent attitude toward the gateway?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.973" offset="12219225">Answer - “In this way the railroad that has two gateways such as Effner and Chicago are not provoked if we get the haul through Effner.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.187" offset="12264155">“That is benevolent attitude?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.845" offset="12270738">Answer - “Benevolent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.826" offset="12274709">What is the difference if they are on a parity?</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.030" offset="12283486">Answer - “That's it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.469" offset="12289233">Question - You think they are synonymous then?</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.098" offset="12299786">Answer - “I think they are synonymous.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.666" offset="12310026">And so if this testimony given by the witness for the successful applicant has any meaning at all, they simply perpetuated the hopes on the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.808" offset="12354644">There isn't any parity, there isn't any solicitation, we're going to have exactly the same thing that we had before active competition by Santa Fe, the Pennsylvania and the Wabash.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.036" offset="12403545">I -- I think in a great deal of time on the individual -- I may say that the subject is discussed in our principal brief on pages 40 to 42 in our reply brief pages 20 to 23 with the citations to the record on each of the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.849" offset="12482748">There -- there are other aspects of the -- the comparative hearing that are significant unless the failure genuinely to make a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of the two applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.573" offset="12537710">There was no effort to make a systematic evaluation weighing and balancing of the advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.221" offset="12572296">Let me illustrate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.382" offset="12580864">In 13 different instances, the Commission found -- made no findings but said -- recited the position of Minneapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.581" offset="12617644">Minneapolis insists, Minneapolis contends, Minneapolis states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.040" offset="12639483">On economies they said Minneapolis claims economies of $1,770,000 and those were specified I may say job for job, facility for facility, yard for yard, office for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.335" offset="12708760">And it made no evaluation to that, but when it came to the Pennsylvania-Santa Fe application it said with representatives of Pennsylvania and Santa Fe on the Board, there ought to be able to find more economical ways of operating Western.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.536" offset="12769468">This indefinite they hoped was worthy of a finding but the $1,770,000 in savings each year was not dignified by any evaluation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.077" offset="12811682">Nor did they make any evaluation as to the public service aspects of the improved service proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.559" offset="12845641">The Commission found only one thing about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.176" offset="12860061">It said, “This new service would be extremely harmful to other carriers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.927" offset="12883048">And that's substantially a quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.974" offset="12891303">The only citation for that is the testimony of the president of the Wabash, a subsidiary of Pennsylvania, that a “large part” of 6500 cars a year could possibly be influenced away by Minneapolis if the connections at Forest are improved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.942" offset="12979179">Now the connections that Western has -- has at Forest and they were talking about traffic that would move -- that now moves as he put it, along Wabash up to Albia and Des Moines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.823" offset="13062666">The amount is -- is a pitifully small amount as you can see from the fact that the Wabash moves in at 20,000 cars a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.040" offset="13091506">And even then, the Wabash was not able to say how much of that large part would originate east of the point of cutoff at Des Moines here and how much west because the Western originations and destinations could not possibly be diverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.796" offset="13170604">So with that very vague and definite generality about a very tiny movement the Commission said the (Inaudible) program for improved service is extremely harmful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.984" offset="13227342">When it turned to the other side of the coin, it knew how to -- to use a real yardstick.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.151" offset="13255973">It said that if the Pennsylvania-Santa Fe improved service, and as a result divert traffic, it will not jeopardize the ability of any other carrier to provide adequate transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.132" offset="13319920">That of course has some real relationship to the transportation -- national transportation policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.028" offset="13351476">I want to hurry along because my time is running out and talk about the labor situation that Mr. Justice Frankfurter referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.912" offset="13399019">In an industry in which 50 cents out of every dollar goes to wages you can't have economies, you can't have elimination of duplication without affecting wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.289" offset="13432560">It's utterly impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.187" offset="13440084">The Commission said the 256 positions would be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.533" offset="13457533">That's quite true, but it didn't say was the stability of employment was derived not from the number of positions you have but from the efficiency and economy of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.620" offset="13497866">That if a gateway dried up there wouldn't be jobs for the people that were there anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.445" offset="13517197">It didn't say that the -- Minneapolis showed that on the basis of its own experience with the average age of its executives below the officer level at 64, the natural attrition, would provide vacancies in the time necessary because the integration couldn't be carried out overnight to move these people into other positions and as a further precaution Minneapolis and St. Louis offered its application to adopt the Washington Job Agreement which provides security for employees for a five-year period and in fact permits employees with five years in service to get a year's pay -- a severance pay if they want to move another job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.547" offset="13717608">That was not evaluated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.658" offset="13721997">There was no determination whether there'd be 10 people or six people affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.577" offset="13741641">They talked only of the 256 positions which, of course, is an unrealistic appraisal of the problem of employment in and of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.328" offset="13780720">I want to move on to point two if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.081" offset="13787721">There's much more to be said about the lack of the findings, the absence of findings that we deal with in our brief, the failure to meet the obligation for a comparative hearing in the true sense because what they did was to say the ideal thing is to keep this property as it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.969" offset="13855222">Obviously that can't be done if you have integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.394" offset="13868910">Hence the Pennsylvania-Santa Fe plan was the only one to be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.414" offset="13881031">There was no effort to add up the advantages, the disadvantages, the risks, the jeopardies and the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.508" offset="13909452">The second point we make is that the entire transaction of Pennsylvania-Santa Fe is rooted in illegality because the purchase, the dealings in securities between Pennsylvania and Santa Fe are illegal under Section 10 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.812" offset="13970578">Now the Commission disposed off that in one way that District Court suggested some others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.680" offset="13994088">And I think all of them were interesting but none of them very helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.194" offset="14012165">The Commission thought that because the second contract was signed by the Santa Fe, it was not a transaction between Pennsylvania and Wilmington Trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.059" offset="14059604">I would think that having the partner sign does not immunize the transaction but more than that, the dealings had already taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.758" offset="14086353">One contract had already been signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.400" offset="14092936">Those were the foundations for this transaction so that the dealings and contract in violation of the statute had already occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.364" offset="14128880">The Court thought that possibly the fact that Pennsylvania Company put up the money and bought the 50% interest and was not itself a carrier although wholly owned subsidiary of Pennsylvania might immunize the transaction, but to answer that we need only look at the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.992" offset="14199306">It's an application by Santa Fe and Pennsylvania Railroad to acquire control of Western through the purchase of 50% by Santa Fe and 50% by the Pennsylvania Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.225" offset="14244237">So they met the reality of the situation which the Court was unwilling to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.518" offset="14261478">And because the Commission didn't see this as a Section 10 problem, they had no desire or need to inquire as to whether immunizing the transaction was in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.366" offset="14316857">Now it's true that under 5 (11) transactions or acts necessary to carry out a Commission order are relieved from the restraints of antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.866" offset="14366804">That presents two problems here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.639" offset="14373909">One is can they give condemnation under that statute to an act that is already illegal, not something done to carry out the Commission's order which is what the statute contemplates, nothing -- not something in future, something that has already occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.913" offset="14439006">And secondly if it is within the scope of the Commission's power is it not incumbent upon the Commission to set out precisely the reason, the public interest consideration that warrants overriding the policy of Section 10 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.430" offset="14513089">We come finally to the question which is of general and far reaching importance and that is the extent to which the Commission is called upon in administering the Interstate Commerce Act to accommodate the objectives of that Act with the objectives of the national antitrust policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.752" offset="14606399">Let me say that that was clarified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.438" offset="14621132">The issue was clarified for us by the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.560" offset="14637641">For the first time, the Commission now explains what is added to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.592" offset="14657703">The Government's brief says that the national transportation laws were adopted in replacement or to use their language in lieu of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.890" offset="14706918">We do not read the McLean case either in its prevailing opinion or in its minority opinion to say any such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.970" offset="14739205">We assume that the Court said what it meant when it said that the two policies should be accommodated to the extent that they can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.824" offset="14782673">And of course in accommodating the statutes the economic motivations, the purposes, the alternative possibilities that the second application presents must be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.937" offset="14835127">Secondly the McLean case says as we see it that the transportation goals maybe permitted to override antitrust violations if positive gains are -- are achieved in transportation and if competition remains sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.370" offset="14928854">And that's the standard I may say that the Commission itself adopted just last year in the (Inaudible) case where they said that they have the right to overrule the antitrust limitations if affirmative transportation gains are affected and if it's necessary to achieve those gains and they take such form as economies, improvement in service and new efficiency and provided further that adequate competition remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.456" offset="15065213">If that standard will apply here, this order could not stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.963" offset="15083186">And I may say that basic to the Commission's error in this respect is the fact that it -- it played around with diversions of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.699" offset="15126131">It was concerned about whether one carrier or another would lose a few hundred or few thousand cars of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.496" offset="15145357">If never faced up to the full sweep of the antitrust problem, to the mechanism that was being set up here that would, if Sante Fe and Pennsylvania already pre-eminent in the Chicago and the St. Louis and the Decatur gateways, virtual domination of the Peoria gateway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.310" offset="15216619">It never faced up to the fact that we were dealing with gateway competition on a large national transcontinental scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.878" offset="15246921">And in that respect it failed to meet its obligations in determining public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.025" offset="15267506">The public interest could not possibly be assessed without taking into account that major problem of gateway competition, the major power, the concentration that was being afforded to the two giants who had undertaken this venture for the deliberate purposes of -- of stifling competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.729" offset="15370324">I may say that while this was directly shown out of the minds of the people of Pennsylvania, the Santa Fe morality is not any better.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.855" offset="15410761">The president of Santa Fe testified that he preferred to control the Western, rather than have everyone saying they'll purchase and that's it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4311.640" offset="17349883">I will attempt to cover in whatever time I have left.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.193" offset="17364093">The position of those two States, the Attorney General of South Dakota, Mr. Parnell Donohue is here today and he joins with me in the presentation that I have so far as the State of South Dakota is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.686" offset="17426160">There is, of course, a dual system of regulation Federal and State, both of which have certain areas of responsibility and certain areas of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.920" offset="17463045">Generally speaking, they're both to promote the public interest and as I understand the public interest in the matter of railroads, it is to -- there to provide an adequate system of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.041" offset="17511528">Now, South Dakota and Minnesota in the discharge of their duties to represent this particular public interest wish to emphasize two basic concerns to the Court, namely, the preservation and development of the M&amp;STL and the preservation and development of the Peoria gateway.</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.940" offset="17595120">Now as to the M&amp;STL in our Exhibit H77 we have shown general information about the economic contributions of the M&amp;STL to the State of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.937" offset="17643081">We're not so much concerned about those as its contributions to our transportation system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.001" offset="17667427">Now of the total of 1397 miles of the M&amp;STL system, 399 are in Minnesota and 154 in South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.004" offset="17707342">It serves 57 Minnesota towns, and 17 South Dakota towns.</text>
            <text syncTime="4406.453" offset="17729181">It provides the only rail service to 42 Minnesota towns and 13 South Dakota towns.</text>
            <text syncTime="4414.152" offset="17760005">It also provides the only mainline service to the Peoria gateway.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.539" offset="17777560">Now what are the consequences of this case upon the M&amp;STL?</text>
            <text syncTime="4423.438" offset="17797099">First of all, approval of the M&amp;STL application in our judgment would promote both the federal and the state transportation policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.470" offset="17833253">The M&amp;STL has a shaky economic history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.058" offset="17847568">It had a 20-year receivership and was nearly dismembered in proceedings before the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.738" offset="17874317">Presently, it is financially sound and we believe it's fully capable of handling this T&amp;W undertaking, yet it needs the TP&amp;W to remove their basic weakness which it has which is its need for diversification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.904" offset="17942967">It's primarily reliant on agricultural traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.595" offset="17973791">M&amp;STL unification with the Toledo, Peoria and Western would give both roads an increased efficiency and improved solicitation and would give both of them a chance to compete better with larger railroads and also with other forms of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4483.974" offset="18039306">In addition TP&amp;W traffic would broaden the base of heavy density traffic to offset the large areas of low density traffic particularly in South Dakota and Minnesota which we're concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4498.044" offset="18095522">On the other hand the approval of Pennsylvania-Santa Fe application, we think would be undermining both the federal and State interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.444" offset="18129168">It would eliminate all of the positive advantages of the M&amp;STL which I've just covered not only now but possibly forever in the sense that this is its logical opportunity for expansion and always was considered to be such and we don't see any other immediate possibility to diversify and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.912" offset="18215058">Further it would divert at one point about $1,100,000 of revenue along the NEMO-Peoria segment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4537.046" offset="18251525">Now the effect of that could be possible abandonment as was justified to by our witness, Dr. Nightingale, a -- a PhD in the field of transportation, a man of many years experience and Mr. Carr from South Dakota their witness, that is South Dakota's witness and also Mr. Swanson of the M&amp;STL suggested the possibility of abandonments if they lose this revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.878" offset="18350895">Even if there weren't abandonments there's the possibility of retrenchment in other -- and other areas which we feel would not be to the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.523" offset="18393422">Now the Commission's statement with respect to abandonment from Minnesota we feel gives no real protection to Minnesota and South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="4581.079" offset="18427695">It simply says that there were no abandonments presently contemplated and that in any event there would have to be an application to ICC.</text>

            <text syncTime="4645.076" offset="18683695">Well, as I understand that for station closings and -- and for non-service tracks, the -- the public utilities of South Dakota or Minnesota could handle it otherwise it would be ICC and of course we're concerned about that situation too.</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.928" offset="18767078">Now, we think that the real answer lies to the promotion of the economic strength of the M&amp;STL and not to some kind of an answer that you'll have to first get authority before you get benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4681.348" offset="18828727">In this attitude of the Commission we feel it's particularly distressing in -- in view of its contrasting solicitude for possible abandonments along the Wabash where there was no -- no testimony that there would have to be any abandonment, but only that there might be some diversion of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.127" offset="18899884">We don't think that was a fair treatment of our interest where we had three witnesses that specifically recognized the possibility of abandonments.</text>

            <text syncTime="4723.585" offset="18997687">Fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4724.623" offset="19001866">Well the importance to Minnesota and South Dakota is -- is the fact that neither Minnesota nor South Dakota is ideally situated geographically in terms of railroad movements to the east because of the presence of the Great Lakes we have to rely on either Chicago or Peoria to get to the east.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.023" offset="19079502">Now it's obviously more desirable to have two gateways that are active than to team up with one and as a consequence if anything should happen to the Peoria gateway in terms -- not of its total disappearance but let's say its decreased effectiveness or ability to handle traffic through it while that would be prejudicial to the interest of Minnesota in terms of -- of either peace time or national emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.926" offset="19195068">Now the effects of -- the effects of this proceeding on the Peoria gateway as we consider them we haven't seen no application would result in vitalization of the Peoria gateway.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.572" offset="19273644">First of all the outer belt concept of the operation of the Peoria gateway to avoid the congestion of Chicago has been in -- in large measure the -- the cause for success of both the M&amp;STL and the Toledo, Peoria and Western.</text>
            <text syncTime="4808.902" offset="19338951">The M&amp;STL has no other gateway connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4812.471" offset="19353266">Its economic incentive would be to maximize movements through the Peoria gateway in competition with other gateways such as St. Louis and Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.039" offset="19391509">The success of the M&amp;STL and TP&amp;W unified operation would depend 100% on a promotion of the Peoria gateway.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.481" offset="19429334">On the other hand we consider the -- Pennsylvania-Santa Fe combination's proposal as resulting in stagnation of the Peoria gateway.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.536" offset="19473533">The main interest of Pennsylvania and Santa Fe lie in competing gateways which is to say Chicago and St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.162" offset="19511986">Their divided ownership in the Toledo, Peoria, and Western would add to their lack of economic incentive to fully exploit the gateway.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.621" offset="19549811">Also they would have the lack of -- of the intense purpose that the M&amp;STL and -- and the Western operation would have because of the comparative unimportance of the operation when considered along with the size of the rest of their systems.</text>
