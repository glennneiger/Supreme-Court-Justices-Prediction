            <text syncTime="11.351" offset="148773">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.420" offset="173014">This is case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.482" offset="205302">The Fifth Circuit affirmed these convictions of the petitioners on the various counts of an indictment, 19 counts of which, charged violations of the federal mail fraud statute and the 20th count of which charged the violation of the conspiracy statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.290" offset="300492">This Court granted certiorari on two questions, first, whether the mail fraud statute is applicable in -- to this indictment and the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.913" offset="359006">And second, whether the defendants should have been granted access to the grand jury testimony of one of the witnesses at the trial, Diego Heras.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.291" offset="428492">In addition, due to impart to developments after petitioners have filed their petition for a certiorari with this Court and after the Solicitor General had filed his brief in our position to the petition for certiorari and the manner had been submitted to this Court because of events happening thereafter, to which I shall elude.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.532" offset="545520">In our brief, we have suggested that the Court considered whether this case is suitable for the exercise of its supervisory power and whether the case calls for the exercise by this Court of its supervisory power over the administration of the federal criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.534" offset="645517">Now, with the Court's kind indulgence, I shall commence with a discussion of the mail fraud point, which in our submission will dispose of the case and in our submission should result in a dismissal of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.743" offset="726392">Before doing that, I should like very briefly to give the Court, if I may, an idea of our point with respect to the grand jury testimony question and a very brief idea of the reason why we have respectfully suggested consideration of the invocation and use in this case of this Court's supervisory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.314" offset="844675">I shall then go to the mail fraud point and shall then return to the grand jury and the supervisory power points.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.484" offset="881351">On the grand jury point, the witness, Diego Heras, was in our submission, the Government's principal witness, the Government disputes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.681" offset="938088">His testimony occupied 23% of the record below about 1000 pages out of about 6000 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.896" offset="978944">The Court instructed the jury below that they might convict on the testimony -- on the unsupported testimony of an accomplice.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.808" offset="1022621">The Court instructed the jury that Diego Heras was an accomplice.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.380" offset="1056893">The Court of Appeals stated that Diego Heras' testimony contained many inconsistencies and contradictions and it's said that the jury might have considered him far from trust -- trustworthy, as we argue in our briefs, those are mild and gentle words.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.589" offset="1209762">Now, subsequent as I said, after the petition for certiorari and the Government's brief had been submitted to this Court, the Solicitor General filed a memorandum in this Court saying in fact, “Oops, we're very sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.193" offset="1288129">There is no transcript of Diego Heras' testimony before the grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.960" offset="1327208">That despite the fact that the distinguished prosecuting attorney, in the case in the District Court, Mr. Wilkey who was then United States Attorney in Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.402" offset="1381021">Mr. Wilkey had stated trice in the trial court, in response to inquiry that there was a transcript of Mr. Heras' testimony and there are yards of words that were spelled in the District Court and miles of words that were debated in the Court of Appeals on that assumption and the case was litigated by the -- by the defense on that basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.591" offset="1589687">Your Honor, there is no doubt I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.842" offset="1598777">Perhaps Mr. Wilkey will agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.113" offset="1607868">I believe there is no doubt that the Court was asking him, “Do you have a transcript of Mr. Heras' testimony before this grand jury?”</text>
            <text syncTime="387.213" offset="1652276">And that Mr. Wilkey said, “I do.”</text>
            <text syncTime="389.794" offset="1662516">When he was asked that question on two additional times, Mr. Wilkey said he has it in his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.944" offset="1687176">Now, we as -- say as I hope to show in a few minutes that this is a case that falls within the -- this Court's doctrine as laid down in Procter &amp; Gamble and Pittsburgh Plate Glass, that this was a case of ultimate and absolute need because of the critical nature of Heras' testimony and because of his demonstrated unreliability and because he was a witness beholding to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.466" offset="1833253">Now, I feel it necessary again as I profess here to state why we have suggested that this Court consider whether this case is appropriate for invocation of its supervisory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.264" offset="1904410">In the first place, if the Solicitor General's statement is accepted that Mr. Heras was examined before the grand jury in this case and his testimony was not reported, we believe that that calls for an exercise of this Court's supervisory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.587" offset="2013706">We do not contend that under the rules, it is necessary as a matter of law for the testimony of every witness before a federal grand jury in Texas to be reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.665" offset="2078072">We do contend that in the circumstances of this case, it was an abuse not to record the testimony of Heras as an example and now come to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.328" offset="2140662">The Government knew at the time that Heras was put on the -- on the stand before the grand jury that he had given an affidavit, sworn affidavit to the FBI concerning the petition of Parr, that he had subsequently, given a contradictory affidavit to the FBI on the same matter in which he had said that he had not told the truth in his first affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.274" offset="2256436">The Government knew and Mr. Heras had not been prosecuted as part of this great kettle of fish involved in this part of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.744" offset="2318399">The Government knew that Mr. Heras was dependent upon the Government's mercy.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.189" offset="2352149">Every other important witness called before the grand jury, I think there were over 75, the testimony of all except four of the witnesses called before that grand jury was reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.159" offset="2415992">Of the other -- of this four, one was Heras, then the -- there was another one who was the -- a postal inspector and there were two people who were not witnesses at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.602" offset="2461759">All the others were transcribed.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.459" offset="2589236">And the Government's brief says that the reason that Mr. Heras' testimony was not recorded, was first that it was well known to the Government so they did not mean a recommendation of it for their own use at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.176" offset="2668126">And second, that he was brought in at the last day when the case was fully developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.668" offset="2694040">Now, that second reason, I find singularly unpersuasive, because Heras was such an important and a key witness and to his suspicious mind and I suspect that I, as an advocate, must have one and who have one, then maybe other reasons for the Government's having delayed and delayed in bringing Heras in as a witness before that grand jury and then finally bringing him in on the last day.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.049" offset="2807620">But I am not -- I can't suggest any -- what -- what the -- what was in the Government's mind beyond what in its papers, I do submit, Mr. Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="716.757" offset="2970415">First, I want to say that this grand jury proceeding was prior to the Jencks case and prior to the rush of interest that has since developed in a -- by -- on a private defendant in obtaining grand jury transcripts, I think that is an important point for the prosecuting attorney on his side.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.844" offset="3058709">On the other hand, Your Honor, my point is that regardless of whether there were or were not sharp motives, that responsible prosecution in the particular circumstances of Mr. Heras, would certainly have caused the prosecuting attorney to see that his testimony was recorded, the testimony of over 70 witnesses before that grand jury on this same manner were reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.077" offset="3199666">Heras was a self-confessed liar, thief, embezzler, who had given the Government a false affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.968" offset="3251284">Certainly, the minimum of prudence, the minimum of proper procedure, in my submission, Your Honor, would have meant that the prosecuting attorney would say in the case of this witness, “Above all, we will have a record because it is my duty to see that this man who has perjured, who has falsely testified before does not perjure himself before the grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="894.400" offset="3680946">Well now, I should like to get to the mail fraud point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.951" offset="3699127">The Government agrees that the mail fraud situation here presents a “unique situation,” that is in quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.869" offset="3742804">They say that there is no case exactly like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.581" offset="3761716">It is our submission to Your Honors that the attempt to use the mail fraud statute in this case is not only unprecedented, but it's contrary to the law and that the result of the use of the mail fraud statute in this case, if it is sustained, would be to expand federal jurisdiction over whether are in substance local crimes, to an extent which would leave very little outside of the scope of federal jurisdiction in terms of the -- the heretofore local crimes of embezzlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.183" offset="3960142">Now, I'll have to just lay the facts out as briefly as I can, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.011" offset="3987414">The event in this case involved the Benavides Independent School District, which is located on the Corpus Christi Division of the Southern District of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.378" offset="4048854">This School District had to duty, under the law, to operate two schools and had the power and the duty to levy and collect taxes on property located in the district for the purpose of raising funds for school operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.162" offset="4132028">Now, there are 11 petitioners here, and six of them were officially connected with the School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.616" offset="4185840">One of them was the Tax Collector of the School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.246" offset="4200364">Three of them were on the Board of Trustees and one of them, for a short period of time, was the attorney for the School District and another was for part of the times, secretary of the School District, that's six of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.536" offset="4265566">The other five were connected with the fiscal affairs of the bank of the School District in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.894" offset="4302973">Two of the other petitioners are banks, one being the official depository for the School District, and then the remaining three persons who are the petitioners here including George Parr, were officials of the banks and it's also alleged that Mr. Parr dominated the affairs of the School District and there is evidence from which a jury might have drawn that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.554" offset="4433586">Now, the indictment herein and the evidence viewed most favorably to the Government, showed that some of the petitioners misappropriated and embezzled funds of the School District over a period of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.333" offset="4544658">They -- overpaid of approximately five years, there's some doubt as to when the embezzlement stood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.340" offset="4580707">Now, the technique by which the scheme to defraud the school operated was this, checks were issued to fictitious persons, nonexistent persons and checks were issued to real persons for a work that they did not do and the proceeds of those checks, the jury might have found, were turned over to the petitioner, Parr.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.101" offset="4719783">Now, this was the scheme, the scheme to which attention was directing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.640" offset="4745906">These practices, as I said, were indulgent from a period of about five, perhaps six years, the indictment come because of the statute of limitations, covers at period September 1, 1951 to December 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.598" offset="4829811">To give you an idea of the magnitude of -- of the embezzlement pursuant to the scheme, a Government -- the Government estimates that the fraudulent checks which I've just described in the five-year period amounted to about $190,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.260" offset="4920404">Now, because it maybe relevant later on, I'm going to divide that by the period of the embezzlements and suggest that mathematically, the embezzlements amounted to a little over $40,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.122" offset="4999816">Because I want you to consider that if you will, as against the annual receipt from school tax assessments which -- or the annual school tax assessments in which run from the amount of $400,000 in 1949 to $650,000 in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.773" offset="5090513">Now, in other words, this was just a small part of the school tax assessments although, it was a lot of money.</text>

            <text syncTime="1289.074" offset="5259682">To the present time, they have all either been acquitted or after conviction, their convictions have been reversed in the appellate courts of the State of Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.817" offset="5338676">Now, I've just described to you the central scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.241" offset="5360306">In addition to this scheme, there is some evidence that there were individuals among these petitioners and perhaps other persons, who engaged in sort of folics of their own, petty grafts, thievery, embezzlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.682" offset="5446092">There are -- the only ones that are involved in this case in that category of this sort of individual frauds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.062" offset="5487574">The -- the only instances involved the individuals Chapa, Garza and Oscar Carrillo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.124" offset="5523832">Those are the only individual cases in which a mail fraud is alleged, as I will come to in a moment, in addition to the general and pervasive scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.834" offset="5574719">The Government says that Chapa, who was the Tax Collector, took for himself some of the tax money belonging to the district, instead of this operating as part of the scheme, Chapa took it for himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.039" offset="5647548">The procedure which Chapa used to get this grant for himself was different from the scheme itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.259" offset="5692374">But the net effect was the same except that Chapa got the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.896" offset="5714944">In the general scheme, you will recall the checks, fictitious checks, were drawn against the general funds of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.859" offset="5762800">In Chapa's case, he being the Tax Collector, into the two instances that are involved in the indictment, he received checks by mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.780" offset="5810448">He then cashed the checks, as he had a right to do under Texas law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.726" offset="5834271">Under Texas law, it is not the checks, but the proceeds of the checks that belong to the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.380" offset="5860916">We've got that brief and I shall pause course to elaborate, that is the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.039" offset="5883486">And Chapa, instead of turning over the cash proceeds of these checks to the district, appropriated them for himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.588" offset="5921729">That's very bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.790" offset="5930506">It is not a mail fraud as we show in our brief and as I think, I'll -- as I hope come too in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.291" offset="5960495">The other individual frolic, if it maybe called that, involves an item that the Government itself in its brief says is quite small and that is that two of the people here, Garza and Oscar Carrillo got -- bought some gasoline for their personal use instead of paying for that of their pockets, they charged it to the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.958" offset="6099153">Again, this is no mail fraud violation as we show in our brief, but I want to come in the little time that I have to the central school, because I am confident that the case turns on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.030" offset="6175535">Now, the essential point, Your Honors, is that this indictment does not charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.673" offset="6214092">There is no evidence to show that anyone of the fraudulent checks drawn on the funds of the district was sent through the mails at anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.124" offset="6279920">It is not those fraudulent checks that are claimed to be violations of the mail fraud statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.997" offset="6319313">Actually, what happened is that all these people lived in and around this little town and the fraudulent checks were made out, they were then passed from hand to hand, passed over to the bank and then the proceeds were taken over by hand allegedly, to Mr. Parr.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.139" offset="6411891">So, the fraudulent checks are not charged as a mail fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.178" offset="6436133">Well, held us, where does the Government get a mail fraud in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.669" offset="6462046">Now, and here we are right at the nub of point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.069" offset="6483675">The Government says that some of these and some of these petitioners, the three members of the Board and the Secretary of the Board operating they say under the domination on this property, were in charged of the School District and had functions with respect to the collection of taxes for the School District, you say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.314" offset="6588583">And since some of those taxes came in by a mail, they say that is a use of the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.842" offset="6642709">Now, I quote the statute for the purpose of executing the fraudulent scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.062" offset="6683669">Now, they say that since one of the taxes were collected by mail since the proceeds of those taxes went into the general funds of the school, since persons stole from the general funds of the school, that therefore, the collection of taxes was a use of the mails for the purpose of executing the embezzlements from the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.142" offset="6795891">Now, every time I say that, it sounds a little complicated, but we have suggested and I believe what an important qualification the Government has been impressed by this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.246" offset="6856391">We have suggested that the Government's proposition here, as just -- is -- it is like to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.138" offset="6887946">Let us suppose that a doctor got a secretary and the secretary sends bills out to all the doctor's patients through the mail and some of the bills are paid by use of the mails and then the payments go into the doctor's account and the girl -- the secretary has a petty cash fund, and let us say every week she dips into the petty cash fund and takes 50 cents or $5 or $10.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.859" offset="7022843">Now, in the Government's theory, in this case, on the theory of this indictment, most embezzlements are a violation of the federal mail fraud statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3096.346" offset="12488808">I made the statement, I suppose the first time, thinking I had the transcript on June the 5th, 1957, a year and three months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.635" offset="12529873">And I will call your attention further that the case has been tried once before in November and December and that I did not have in the courtroom, the transcripts and it had been, I'm satisfied, prior to the first trial that I have had occasion even to refer to the grand jury transcripts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.600" offset="12621824">By the time of the second trial, in trial preparation, as counsel at the table, I had all of the information on all of the witnesses, pretty well reduced to notes that I could hold in my hand and use for examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.525" offset="12689429">In some instances, in this second case, I used a transcript made from the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.680" offset="12714088">But in most instances, I had (Inaudible) the thing down to the very essentials that we needed to present our case, and since we were doing it for the second time, we pretty well new what that was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.248" offset="12764348">And so, I did not refer to the grand jury transcript of errors or any Government witnesses and I don't think I had any occasion to do so, at any time during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.882" offset="12814921">I have no recollection, but I don't think there was any reason for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3183.647" offset="12837909">Now, in the files was a grand jury transcript of Heras and that I'm satisfied in -- looking back on it now, was both what I had in my mind when I say I had a grand jury transcript and secondly, it, along with the 12 or 14 statements that we have of Heras, was the reason that we made no transcript of this witness' testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.497" offset="12933308">This, I assure the Court, was not a selective effort to avoid making a transcript of Mr. Heras for any purpose whatever.</text>

            <text syncTime="3222.521" offset="12993494">We never thought of it that would've required us to make a transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.089" offset="13011780">Now, the petitioner says and admits that there is no requirement that the United States Attorney make a transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.059" offset="13047620">But they say, the extraordinary cases, they actually -- that this is an extraordinary case and therefore, under these circumstances, it was an abuse of prosecutorial discretion, not to make a transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.879" offset="13102895">Now, if we had a discretion, then the question is, whether or not, I exercise that discretion properly.</text>

            <text syncTime="4842.532" offset="19473533">And in December 1952, they discharged him from employment with the School District, although for, later on, for three -- three months period, they asked -- asked him to do some specialized work in concerning city lots of Benavides, in his own office and paid him for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4858.764" offset="19538422">I -- but the evidence is very clear that in July of 1951, the books in records were moved, Heras was -- meant he no longer had any part -- and in his responsible part, he had it no longer, any part in the basic elements of this scheme here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4881.170" offset="19628074">I want to say also that making a grand jury transcript is unusual in our district.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.619" offset="19653883">In fact, in most districts and the only reason that we made a transcript (Inaudible) was that this was a investigative grand jury, in which we were seeking information from witness which we did not have in full and therefore, we made records of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.586" offset="19717726">In the case of Heras, we had 12 or 14 statements and this grand jury transcript and we saw no reason to make another record of Heras.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.598" offset="19761716">And at that time, we had no idea that the Jencks decision was a year and a quarter away, or that any demand would be made for his transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="4951.952" offset="19911137">These are matters that we knew about when we put him before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4961.776" offset="19950425">As far as -- with the exception of those two, contradictory FBI statements, as far as we knew, he was reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.077" offset="19963695">He had told the truth that we have checked out, about this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.060" offset="19979577">Now, let's see that, Heras was the one who first in -- early in 1953, after he was discharged from the School District, he made statements to state and federal investigators in -- in regard to the fictitious names on the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="4988.880" offset="20058885">We checked that out with the postal investigators and the others, interviews with postmasters in this county.</text>
            <text syncTime="4995.240" offset="20084381">And at trial, we put on eight post masters and three or four other witnesses who testified that these names were indeed fictitious.</text>
            <text syncTime="5003.463" offset="20117191">And this we knew, as to the practice of cashing these checks at the bank, we didn't rely entirely on Heras for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.984" offset="20151359">We had Carl Williams, Edna Fitch, Cristine Ray and Reed Nunnally (ph) who had either dealt with Heras three of them had dealt with him and -- correction, two of them had dealt with him, the other one that seen him in there, and Mrs. Cristine Ray, who went to work November the 1st, 1951 taking Carl Williams' place, testified that she had never dealt with Heras and had never seen him in connection with this, but the fictitious checks kept coming in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.279" offset="20276537">And Reed Nunnally testified that Oscar Carrillo's visits to the bank increased noticeably and -- number at that time and he went to see Donald.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.556" offset="20313631">Now, the scheme at the bank as revealed by this eyeball testimony of this witness was that Heras normally went to Donald and Donald went the individual teller and picked up the bundles of cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.857" offset="20366817">So that was confirmed in every way, even the incident about Heras being shortchanged $1000 in which he had, one time, dealt with Mrs. Fitch.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.160" offset="20407986">She made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="5077.018" offset="20411434">She was interrupted by a telephone call and she put only $3000 instead of $4000 in the envelope.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.955" offset="20439228">And when he saw that, he had only three packs, he came back and she found she was $1000 over and he got the extra thousand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.399" offset="20476949">That was remembered by the other people, he took her a box of candy in gratitude, and as Carl Williams testified, he ate some of the candy, the whole bank knew of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.459" offset="20509236">This was no secret going on in the Parr bank desk.</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.870" offset="20522820">Now then, as to Benson, and Benson who was a much more jolting witness to the defendants then was Heras.</text>
            <text syncTime="5112.646" offset="20553958">Benson was the auditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5114.483" offset="20561272">He had handled some of these packages of money in one case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.296" offset="20584573">He had gone to the bank for Parr.</text>
            <text syncTime="5122.272" offset="20592410">In another case, he had conveyed a package from Heras to Parr, which Heras told us about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.030" offset="20615502">And furthermore, Benson had made out the income tax returns, not only at Parr, but at Chapa and Carrillo.</text>
            <text syncTime="5134.916" offset="20643088">And he knew about this extra funds coming in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5138.626" offset="20657925">And in 1953, long after, Heras have severed any connection with the School District, Benson testified as to the $19,667 of unidentified income in Chapa's return and a $10,200 unidentified on Carrillo's return.</text>
            <text syncTime="5160.950" offset="20747160">And there were others years prior to that in which you see the thing just building up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.099" offset="20771819">Now, as to obtain your signs, Mr Heras told us that signs and I think this was after the grand jury, but it confirmed the whole thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.038" offset="20819571">Then Mr. Saenz had an account with the Hebbronville Bank and we went down there and we found there the microfilm and you see the microfilm had disappeared for this five years from the two Parr banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5190.605" offset="20865755">We went down to the Hebbronville and we got this photostats of checks, which cover from 1949 to 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.380" offset="20896893">And they showed that Benson signed -- countersigned the checks until 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.323" offset="20916642">That George Parr countersigned thereafter, with exception of the last month or two when Milligan signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.142" offset="20939943">They show that Heras signed as makers, until June of 1951, that's the last check, June 1951 and thereafter, the factitious checks to the petitioners signs, which were in eight different names deposited to his account, were signed as maker by Oscar Carrillo and Octavio Saenz, which confirmed, what Heras said -- told us as to the practice in the office of who signed the checks and who prepared them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.435" offset="21057076">Now then, in addition to these checks, we had literary hundreds of documents, tax notices, receipts, deposit slips, annual reports and a great number this had the signatures of Parr, Chapa, Saenz, Oscar Carrillo, I think those four principally on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5262.038" offset="21151535">There are any others I don't recall.</text>

            <text syncTime="5281.164" offset="21228022">In every respect, as to what had gone on, as to the origin of the scheme, Heras was confirmed and furthermore, by all this evidence, we carried the scheme on during the period of -- where limitations had not run.</text>

            <text syncTime="7311.079" offset="29347715">And read -- and then say so, as that we have cited the court a case in our reply brief, Madely versus the Trustees of the Conroe School District, decided in 1939, by Court of Civil Appeals of Texas, 130 S.W. 2d 929, which clearly holds that it is not improper for a Board of Trustee to accumulate moneys at the end of the year and that case, they accumulated some $150 -- $200,000 of maintenance tax money, which the district used for construction of buildings which ordinary will be supplied by a bond issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="7348.492" offset="29497344">So, it is not illegal for a School District to set a budget which has a number of variable factors and that one would be the percentages of collections, the others would be expenditures, I serve as a School Board Trustee for six years, in the Brownsville District.</text>
            <text syncTime="7363.116" offset="29555858">And I know what any School Board Trustee knows that you can't set a budget with accuracy, you have some variables on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7370.015" offset="29583444">But under the Government's theory, if the School Board Trustee fixes a budget of lets say, were an expenditure of $10,000 is required for utilities, gas and electricity and so forth and so on, the tax bills are sent out and the money comes in, and only $5000 are used for that purpose, the other $5,000 in -- is embezzled, that would be mail fraud case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7390.430" offset="29665050">Now, Justice -- Mr. Justice Brennan asked the question -- asked us a question a while ago that I want to address myself to.</text>
            <text syncTime="7397.735" offset="29694307">Under Texas law, each year a Board of Trustee is required to fix a budget and the collections, that is tax collections, are based upon, one valuations fixed by a separate Board of Equalization to the rate which is fixed by the School Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="7615.854" offset="30566797">Either the taking or the placing of a letter there was a theory on Government's part to the taking and placing was caused over in Benavides, by the petitioners, 250 miles away.</text>
