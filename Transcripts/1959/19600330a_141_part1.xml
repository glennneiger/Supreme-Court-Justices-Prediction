            <label>Mr. William R. Frazier</label>
            <text syncTime="22.745" offset="194330">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice Warren, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.018" offset="211466">I of course, have -- have the opportunity to hear the rather voluminous arguments of my predecessors in the two cases, namely Evans and Hertz.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.452" offset="249187">And I'm very much interested in it naturally.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.006" offset="263398">I will attempt not to be repetitious as much as I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.518" offset="277400">Frankly, I think, the issues have been somewhat unduly clouded.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.530" offset="297462">Firstly, I would like --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="49.254" offset="300387">That's in understatement.[Laughter]</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_r_frazier" startTime="52.459" stopTime="256.583">
            <label>Mr. William R. Frazier</label>
            <text syncTime="52.459" offset="313240">First, Your Honors, I would like to make this comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.517" offset="329435">Apparently for some reason there, my client, Massey Motors, has gotten too hot to handle, as far as these three cases can -- are concerned, but I would like to point out Your Honors that I -- my case was a first of these cases won by a taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.646" offset="381994">And my colleagues, Mr. Bernhard here, was very, very willing to cite my case both in the Hertz case, before the lower court and it was -- and it was commented on, with approval, by the Ninth Circuit in the (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.988" offset="443329">I have other of these cases too, Your Honor, which they also cite in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.613" offset="457853">Namely, of Lynch-Davidson cases which are now on appeal before us -- Fifth Circuit and Davidson versus Tomlinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.250" offset="500381">To be in with Your Honors, it seems to me that this whole point involved here today, is as much a pure question of tax law as can be brought before a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.567" offset="549595">You can't completely, as I understand it, divorce the facts from the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.011" offset="567463">But in this situation, we come down to almost a pure question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.823" offset="594631">And I'll try to state it once again.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.326" offset="600691">The question, as I understand it, is for the purposes of depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.491" offset="617305">What?</text>
            <text syncTime="129.341" offset="620753">The term, “useful life” under the 1939 Code, met the physical or economic life to the asset as we, the taxpayer, contend or whether as the Government contends, it is the useful life as shown by the particular trade practices of a particular individual taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.148" offset="711973">Now, the question of salvage value, of course, is a reciprocal of the definition of useful life.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.621" offset="737886">It follows like day from night or night from day.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.329" offset="756694">Once you determine the proper legal definition of the term, useful life for purposes of depreciation under Section 23 (l) of the 1939 Code, the reciprocal factor, namely, salvage value, will follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.273" offset="824508">And I mean by this, if the Court should agree with the Government that for this purpose, the term useful life means the useful life in the taxpayer's business is undisputed that in the Massey case, our actual use was one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.271" offset="880410">That Your Honors is a trade practice in the automobile industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.529" offset="901517">All that you know, from your own common knowledge, that automobile dealers keep their personnel in current model cars and if that the manufacturers change these models approximately once each 12 months, sometimes a little more frequently, sometimes less frequently, but approximately one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.072" offset="959613">In this rental car business, it's clear that they do likewise.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.955" offset="975182">They must, as a matter of competition, keep their units that they're offering for rental, new cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.209" offset="1000260">They gain operating advantages by way of expenses that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.971" offset="1015306">They also, as a matter trade practices, make higher recoveries on the resale of those units.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.927" offset="1035055">And it has become almost universal practice in both the rental car business as well as the new car sales operation to use these cars one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.770" offset="1070477">Now, if the Court should agree with the Government that that useful life is one year, then we lose because the salvage value would necessarily have to be the amount that we received on the sale of the units.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.253" offset="1124394">On the other hand, if the Court --</text>

            <text syncTime="257.899" offset="1134947">Sometimes, am I correct that -- that salvage value maybe greater than the original cost?</text>

            <text syncTime="263.731" offset="1158248">And -- and my situation and I will touch on that briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.020" offset="1175489">Would Your Honor like me to comment on the point?</text>

            <text syncTime="269.572" offset="1181654">No, as your -- your own --</text>

          <turn speaker="william_r_frazier" startTime="271.584" stopTime="823.883">
            <label>Mr. William R. Frazier</label>
            <text syncTime="271.584" offset="1189700">On the other hand, if the Court, sees fit under the 1939 Code, to agree with us that useful life means as inherent or abstract or potential useful life, then it would seem to me, on this record that we are -- that the judgment of the Fifth Circuit should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.893" offset="1258977">And that we would be entitled to use an estimated useful life for purposes of computing straight-line appreciation of three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.678" offset="1294085">We, of course, would also have a question of salvage value which would necessarily cause the case to be remanded for the taking of testimonial on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.216" offset="1340270">And that arises this way, Your Honors, I think the history of this thing is of some materiality here.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.855" offset="1358764">My case is a fairly early one.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.234" offset="1368273">You will notice from the plaintiff's Exhibit 5, which is attached to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.767" offset="1382484">The examining agent raise this point on us in April of 1953, rather than go through other administrative procedures and remedies, we elected to pay this tax, forthwith, file the claim for refund, controverting the adjustment of the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.145" offset="1439953">And in due course, institute in our suit in the local District Court, seeking an adjudication of this matter by way of refund suit as opposed to litigation before the Tax Court, as was done in the Evans case.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.914" offset="1487078">The Hertz case went -- as ours did before the District Court in Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.750" offset="1506408">Now, if Your Honors would examine the first page or two, of the plaintiff's Exhibit 5, you will see that examining agent didn't raise any issue as to terms of estimated useful life or salvage value, because that wasn't the practice of the Treasury then, in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.430" offset="1577044">There affair was that inasmuch as we are admittedly an automobile dealer, namely, operating under a franchise from Chrysler Corporation, in the Jacksonville the Florida area and incidentally one of the largest Dodge and Plymouth dealers in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.488" offset="1637334">Since we were in that business, that these company cars remained at all time, stock in trade that they never changed their character to that of a depreciable asset and hence, we were subject, as a matter of law, to know depreciation and hence, the depreciation claim was disallowed in toto.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.344" offset="1712776">And our capital gain claims under Section 117 (j), were reversed to that of ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.495" offset="1741302">And that, Your Honors, was the practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.607" offset="1757811">I have a number of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.114" offset="1763871">One of them that I had was for a corporation known as Duval Motor Company, which is a Ford dealer in the Jacksonville area, which we elected to take the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.075" offset="1799711">In that case, they used a four-year estimated useful life, with no salvage value and the case went up on the issue as to whether or not, these cars were held primarily for sale or primarily for use in the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.526" offset="1849448">If they were held primarily for use in the business, they would qualify for capital gains treatment under Section 117 (j) upheld in service for six or more, under its expressed terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.600" offset="1893752">If they were inventory property or property held primarily for sale, then the school is out, so to speak for us, we didn't qualify for Section 117 (j).</text>
            <text syncTime="455.768" offset="1926457">And from the facts, the Tax Court concluded that the automobiles in question, were held primarily for sale and that was the end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.191" offset="1956133">Had the Tax Court held the units, held primarily for use in the business, we would have been entitled to our depreciation as claimed, because that was not an issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.351" offset="1992808">The first of these cases that arose was the W. R. Stevens Buick Company case which I think was decided in approximately 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.043" offset="2027499">There, a Buick Company, having these executive company cars, claimed depreciation on them in capital gains treatment, it was disallowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.187" offset="2056129">Namely, the capital gains element was disallowed, on the same theory, namely, stock in trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.801" offset="2078595">They went to the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.092" offset="2083715">The Tax Court agreed with the Commissioner's determination and they took an appeal, I think, to the Fourth Circuit, wherein a split decision -- the decision the Tax Court was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.397" offset="2124988">Interestingly enough, for the next years, the same corporation elected to pay the tax and went up through their own local United States District Court, where a contrary finding was made and they received the capital gains treatment and the Government took no appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.679" offset="2186115">The next of these cases was (Inaudible) Chevrolet Corporation, which is the same as our case and they -- accept it was Chevrolet dealership in Knoxville, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.812" offset="2222582">There, the Tax Court interestingly enough, following its prior decision in the -- in the Stevens Buick case, held that the cars were, in fact, held primarily for use of the business and the depreciation claimed a four-year straight-line with no salvage value, was automatically allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.993" offset="2287365">Now, I point this out to Your Honors, to show and I think almost conclusively demonstrate that this is in the nature of an afterthought.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.729" offset="2322265">This argument is the -- with which we are being presented here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.112" offset="2339819">I'll tell Your Honors, frankly.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.849" offset="2346820">I do not think that it was proper for this argument to be made in our case, because it had never, as far as I knew, up to the point that the record was closed in the District Court that we had any such issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.894" offset="2394990">The -- the case was tried on the theory that it was a (Inaudible) case namely, one of these cars were held primarily for use in the business or whether they were inventory property.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.376" offset="2436890">If used for business, we got our depreciation because they had been no disallowance of our three useful life.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.312" offset="2460609">They didn't say we should use four or five.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.563" offset="2469595">They didn't say it was one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.188" offset="2476074">They simply disallowed the depreciation in toto on the theory that it was stock in trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.851" offset="2494777">Now, as far as rental business is concerned, Philber Equipment Company is a leading decision in this field, is on the same footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.893" offset="2518915">There, the question was simply whether the rental cars were held primarily for sales, sets business practice showed that they were sold after approximately one year of use.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.394" offset="2560920">And there, the Third Circuit reversed Judge Ron's decision from the Tax Court and held the taxpayer was primarily holding those units for rental and hence, was entitled to capital gains treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.270" offset="2608462">Now, the same argument is being made here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.297" offset="2616508">It could have been made in the Philber Equipment case, but the fact to the matter is that the Philber case arose earlier than these present cases and hence, this afterthought had not been dreamed up at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.143" offset="2687979">Now, Your Honors -- specifically now, with respect to the resale price of these automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.485" offset="2709295">First, I would like to point out that the taxable years involved in my case for the calendar years 1950 and 1951, bearing in mind also, that my client is an automobile dealer franchised by Chrysler.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.911" offset="2763003">Hence, the units in question are purchased at factory list prices and, of course, are carried in to our depreciation schedules at that cost, which may run as much as 20% to 25% less than the -- than the normal retail price for the cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.866" offset="2822875">In addition to that, if Your Honors recall, the Korean War was in progress at that time and is common knowledge that economic conditions caused the automobile business to improve greatly, because the supply of cars was diminished and the demand accelerated very similar to the years immediately following World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.786" offset="2898526">Hence, we had a ready market for the cars and that, of course, is true in Evans too, they can't deny it.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.072" offset="2919633">Their cars were sold at slightly less than cost, but percentagewise, it's very small.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.218" offset="2940217">Our cars in the aggregate, for the two years in question, were sold for slightly in excess operational cost without regard to the depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.163" offset="2976057">And we say, Your Honors, several things in that connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.945" offset="2991104">One is -- as -- a point was made in the record in this case below that at the time the case was tried, that was not the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.657" offset="3022033">That economic condition had changed in the point that they were not recovering that full cost at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.240" offset="3052335">I would also like to point out it, Your Honors, that as far as we know, price fluctuations are not to be considered for purposes of depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.856" offset="3094758">For example, we know of no authority, which -- which would prevent a taxpayer from depreciating a building, for example, which happened to have been bought during the depression which today is worth many times its original cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.713" offset="3146271">As we understand it, the depreciation that's properly chargeable it's -- if it's a 25-year useful life, continues, notwithstanding the fact that the market value of the particular asset maybe great in excess of its cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.091" offset="3191724">Depreciation, after all, is - is basically a -- an accounting concept, a bookkeeping entry, if you will, where original capital cost are recovered over the estimated useful life of the asset.</text>

            <text syncTime="1487.766" offset="6054431">This matter before Your Honors today, even though my case is a small tax wise involves not too much money, it's mostly a matter of principle, has very far reaching implications as a matter of policy, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.348" offset="6120782">The -- by adopting the Government's theory, the Court will be injecting the subjective test, if you will, for purposes of computing depreciation on ad hoc method, an every man for himself method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.697" offset="6194134">Now, that's going to -- that's going to probably result in more loss of revenue than they're going to pick up out of this rental car companies and my company, and related companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.639" offset="6229974">Because the taxpayers will now be able to gain accelerated depreciation on a grand scale by taking assets which normally, under the old concept, carried a 10-year useful life and actually putting him into service for five years and charging them off in five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.020" offset="6291414">Of course, the statute of limitations would bar at least a portion of the years on reexamination as far as salvage values is concerned and the -- unless the Congress changes Section 1231, which is the present counterpart of Section 117 (j).</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.917" offset="6343032">There will be long-term capital gain treatment realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.004" offset="6359437">Conversely, it can work against the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.090" offset="6367692">He may, just as well, take an asset that would carry a 10-year useful life and everyone agrees that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.306" offset="6388590">But as a matter of trade practice or business judgment or necessity, he might sell that machine in five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.936" offset="6411160">Well, of course, he would report any gain or loss on that as the difference between his cost and the depreciation he'd taken on a 10% basis, if it were straight line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.948" offset="6443133">The treasury, they say, “Oh, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.503" offset="6449403">You can't do that because the useful life of five years, and even though you can't get a tax benefit for some of this, you've got to reduce that cost as if it they'd been set up on a 20% basis and hence, your capital gain is much larger.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.117" offset="6495796">So, it will -- it will add a great deal of confusion in bickering and we think, it is a matter which should be properly disposed off after due consideration by the Congress, rather than having the -- the Government seek to get a retroactive adjudication, which will hit taxpayers out of the blue, if you will, Your Honors, by -- by court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.521" offset="6581478">And it is for these reasons that we honestly urge Your Honors to see, if it all possible, whether you can adopt as the -- as the disposition on this matter of the theory and rational, but what I think is excellently recent decision of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.277" offset="6652531">And I think, the equally well-reasoned decision of the lower court, that is the trial court, in the Hertz case, wherein he held that under the -- the judge held, that under the 1939 Code, we would be correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.816" offset="6698611">If our case had come before him, he would have held for us, for holding that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1663.253" offset="6756394">First, there was testimony in both the Evans and Hertz cases, if I may advert to them for a moment, that in the past, the taxpayers had used cars in the rental business for five, six, and as much as seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.660" offset="6802056">So the absence of any -- showing here of the disallowance of the claim for depreciation, I think, has no weight whatever, until we know what precisely, the facts were with respect to the practice to any -- in any particular year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.330" offset="6856704">Of course, also, the Government is not contending for a rule which would provide that if, in fact, the taxpayer disposes of a particular asset at a certain time, that fixes its useful life.</text>

            <text syncTime="2343.789" offset="9478562">This Court stated, “The Congress has provided for deductions of annual amounts of depreciation, which along with salvage value will replace the original investment of the property at the time of its retirement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.759" offset="9526418">Well, how can you replace the original investment in the property, if you are not computing the time of retirement based upon the economic effects or facts which affect the taxpayer?</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.478" offset="9569259">If you based them on some abstract notion of time of retirement, you cannot recover the original investment.</text>
