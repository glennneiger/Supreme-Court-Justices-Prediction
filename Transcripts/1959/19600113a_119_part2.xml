            <text syncTime="81.134" offset="427865">But most of the statutes are declaratory to the common law in this respect, and stated in those terms, the courts there presented with virtually the same question that this Court is.</text>

            <text syncTime="119.381" offset="580942">On the other hand, we have cited the line of cases in our brief where -- where the husband has committed assaults against the wife and the courts have there held that it does come within the exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.409" offset="1372975">And it's important to point out to the Court that so far there has been no great extension of this principle to other than the Mann Act cases and the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.954" offset="1415189">None that is apparent from the research which we've done.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.605" offset="1801801">He opened the -- opened his argument by suggesting to this Court, I think, that the marital privilege which is before this Court is a very small matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.755" offset="1838373">It isn't very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.133" offset="1847881">And so if you whittle away at this privilege, the Court will not have done very much, because it's important to get convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.122" offset="1883826">This is as I viewed Mr. Connor's opening remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.131" offset="1899917">Well, I suggest to the Court that every privilege has the effect that the Government Counsel has suggested to this one and that the marital privilege is a very important privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.172" offset="1948087">It isn't one that someone has thought up yesterday or the day before.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.589" offset="1977762">And as Rule 26 says, it should take a lot of reason and a lot of experience before it's overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.648" offset="2025932">And Mr. Connor made some rather important remarks, I think, when he told the Court that the Government has never felt it necessary to go to Congress to get a change in the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.772" offset="2090506">This, it seems to me, is significant.</text>
