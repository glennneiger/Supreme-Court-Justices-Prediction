            <text syncTime="1198.046" offset="4895535">First of all, De Veau is not automatically disbarred from holding a checker's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.715" offset="4930226">The law of the Waterfront Commission specifically spells out that he has a right to a hearing and they placed a five-year probation period in there and a five-year disqualification of the felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.343" offset="4984769">So he is entitled to a hearing and in their discretion, they can't grant him a license to be a checker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.502" offset="5017370">It is to be noted that in all the -- all the occupations spelled out under the findings and the declarations namely longshoremen, hiring agents, watchmen and stevedores they're all provisions for hearings and provisions for notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.912" offset="5091035">They have a right to appeal to the courts if they're not satisfied with the determination of the Waterfront Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.580" offset="5117680">Section 8 goes much further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.851" offset="5126771">It gives them no right of hearing, no right to bring in witnesses, no right to show that he has over the years became -- become a citizen of good character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.415" offset="5177031">It's not based on character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.793" offset="5182568">It's based mainly for the purpose of punishment and for the purpose to be (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.225" offset="5212244">There's no other reason for this Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.250" offset="5228335">I'd like to point out also that we still maintain that Congress has given no -- had given no consideration of Section 8, the only place that it was brought up was in a committee hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.527" offset="5285491">Congress wasn't aware of Section 8, and the only -- even -- even in the state hearings and the recommendations before the state legislature, there was no recommendation that they should take any action against unions.In fact they took the opposite view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.836" offset="5346722">They took the position that Congress should be consulted and that there were revisions coming up before the Tart-Hartley -- under Tart-Hartley law, and that therefore they should present these changes to Congress.</text>
