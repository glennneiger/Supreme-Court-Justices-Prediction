            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">I came from the bench of the argument yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.150" offset="124008">Justice Harlan asked if the record revealed how long the jury was out.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.178" offset="140100">On page 405 of the original record on file with the clerk, it indicates the jury returned at 4:26 in the afternoon and returned with a verdict at 6:06.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.535" offset="193494">So they were out about an hour and 40 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.529" offset="213452">Some reference has been made to the fact that the trial judge before he submitted the substantive counts to the jury refer to the fact that it was a very slender case.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.939" offset="251173">He did say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.854" offset="254830">He said, “Off-hand, I think this is a very slender case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="42.561" offset="273638">After the verdict was returned, the motion for a new trial was made as to all 15 counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.851" offset="294745">He granted it as to five, but did not grant it as to the 10, which still remain in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.785" offset="318464">The issue of the sufficiency of the evidence was brought up to the Court of Appeals and was thoroughly reviewed there as the opinion reveals.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.176" offset="348035">It has not been brought to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.483" offset="357334">I would also say on the point that the full record contains somewhat more evidence than the printed record here that is, there is testimony of both witnesses for the prosecution and witnesses for the defense whose testimony is not included in the printed transcript, but it is included in the original transcript on file with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.804" offset="450539">Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked about the catch line with respect to the denial of the motion for production of notes on page 93 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.713" offset="494216">I have ascertained from the clerk that that catch line which is in the capitals on page 93 was inserted by the clerk of this Court in preparing the record for printing for the convenience of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.931" offset="547088">And it is done so that an index can be made up from the beginning for the convenience of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.101" offset="567777">The original record, as I said yesterday, contains just what we have here and has no indication of any deletions or elisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="639.955" offset="2663215">And that's why they are not properly usable in the impeachment process, which I will try to develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.152" offset="2687979">My understanding is, I maybe wrong, counsel may be able to correct me, that -- but that the prior trial was before a different judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.330" offset="2716714">Now, on the -- on the problem of the Jencks Act, our position is that it is quite clear that under the Jencks Act, that private uncommunicated notes made by a private witness, that is a Government witness who is not employed by the -- by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.073" offset="2779617">The office assistants of Dr. Needelman in this case, who were Government witnesses but not employed by the Government, that if they made private notes of their conversations with Dr. Needelman, which they did not hand over to the Government, that would not be producible under the Jencks Act, that's clearly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.342" offset="2844714">This would be personal uncommunicated private notes of those private government witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.092" offset="2867702">Our position is that when the witness involved is a Government agent and he has notes which he has made in the course of his investigation or -- or -- what the facts he has encountered, and he does the same thing that that private witness does, he does not communicate the notes to the Government but keeps them in himself, that he is in the same position and that his notes are not compellable under the Jencks Act as a matter of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.109" offset="2971773">We think this follows both from the terms of the statute and from the purpose of -- of the Jencks Act and from the basic character of notes, which I would want to go into.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.026" offset="3007509">The terms of the statute has been discussed with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.468" offset="3021197">And I would just like to say that the only -- the -- it's quite clear that subsection (a) and subsection (e) (2) refer to statements made to a government agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.130" offset="3087862">The whole basis of the -- of my opponent's position really is subsection (e) (1), which is on page 3 of our -- our brief and which says that a statement includes a written statement made by said witness and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.404" offset="3157034">Now, I would suggest that if merely because the agent's notes were in his own handwriting, if that were enough to make them producible, Congress would not have said a written statement made by the witness and sign or otherwise adopted or approved by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.099" offset="3227773">It would have stop with the statement of written statement made by the witness because everything in the witness' own handwriting would be included in the phrase, a written statement made by said witness, but Congress didn't stop there and went on to say, “And sign or otherwise adopted or approved by him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="799.251" offset="3300394">And we think that this means really that it's -- that the witness has to acknowledge responsibility to someone else for these notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.258" offset="3340413">He has to communicate them to someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.492" offset="3349295">It's not enough that he was writing a momento or a -- a mnemonic device to himself and that -- and this fits in really with the entire structure of the Jencks Act because what -- as the Court well knows, what the Congress was dealing with and what this Court was dealing within the Jencks case were reports or statements made by a witness to the Government, which the Government could use in the preparation of the case, which they could use in -- in the -- in knowing what the witness would testify to and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.636" offset="3469876">And the Court felt and the Congress agreed that it was -- it was consistent with the fair trial that that kind of statement should be made available to the defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.246" offset="3512404">But neither the Court in the Jencks case nor Congress in the Jencks Act were dealing with private uncommunicated notes which had been not been used by the Government in the preparation of the case or even were known to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.296" offset="3564544">And -- and there is a good reason -- before I go on to the reason, I -- I would say that we have support in the legislative history, we believe, for this possession, because not only was there a very explicit discussion at various points in the legislative history that what Congress was dealing with was reports made to an agent of the Government but in the house manager statement at the conference report, which is the Court recognized in the Palermo case last year, it's very significant with respect to the legislative history of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.473" offset="3689305">The house manager said that among the changes agreed upon with the Senate Conferees was to limit the types of statements and reports, which come under the provisions of the bill, the statements of Government witnesses or perspective witnesses other than a defendant made to an agent of the Government, and they italicized, they italicized in their report the phrase “made to an agent of the Government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="921.682" offset="3790137">So we think that -- that they indicated very clearly that they were talking about communicated information and not something which was kept within the agent's or the witnesses' own bosom.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.180" offset="3844054">And Congressman Cellar, who is particularly interested in this and Senator Ommaney were explicit on this point that its reports made to an agent of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.121" offset="3895881">One of the reasons they were interested in this, if I may say by the way, is that they wanted to make sure that the old rules, I think this is one of the reasons, the old rules such as the rule of refreshing recollection of the Goldman case, there were a witness understand uses materials to refresh his recollection.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.476" offset="3969233">They wanted to make sure that that rule was not cut off by the Jencks statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.519" offset="3985429">And Mr. Justice Brennan, if I -- I think that this is the explanation of the change -- of the omission of the original exclusive language at subsection (a) and the change in the conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.863" offset="4034853">I think this is the true explanation of that change because under the language, as it was originally worded, that is no reports would be producible except as provided in subsection (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="994.437" offset="4081142">And if you had some material or summary, for instance, which was not producible under subsection (b) because it was not a verbatim or substantially verbatim statement, but it was used by the witness om the stand to refresh his recollection at that time under the literal terms of this -- of the bill as it was worded before the conference, that would not have been producible to the defense counsel because it would have been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.750" offset="4174346">And I think that the true -- the true reason for the change in the language to which both you and the majority of the Court adverted in the Palermo case was to continue the rule of the Goldman case from materials which were used to refresh recollection because the rule, as I hope to be able to say for few minutes later on, the rule of the Goldman case is that where material is used on the stand, it's almost automatically producible not always, where it is used off the stand then it is producible within the discretion of -- of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.218" offset="4304227">And I think that this is what people like Congressman Cellar and Senator Ommaney were worried about that the Jencks Act might cut off an accepted rule which no one was challenging.</text>

            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="1065.157" offset="4363995">No, I -- I would cast a little warning on this that in our brief, we inaccurately say that Congressman Cellar opposed an amendment relating to refreshing recollection, that is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.207" offset="4416240">There -- the -- an original bill which was just read on the floor in order to have something else substituted contained this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.454" offset="4441213">They didn't -- any of them referred to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.226" offset="4448319">But they did refer generally to preexisting rules of law that everyone accepted that preexisted Jencks, I meant, or the Jencks case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.140" offset="4479979">And that no one wanted to do away with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.934" offset="4487084">And they were afraid that the Jencks bill, as it was originally formulated, would do a way with these old rules of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.473" offset="4521253">Now, why do I say that -- that there is a great difference between personal uncommunicated notes and the kind of statements which the -- the Congress was interested in -- in producing for the defendant, and which the Court in the Jencks case was interested in producing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.522" offset="4593455">We all know that personal notes that people make that -- that I make, that members of the Court make, that other people make vary with the personality and habits and everything else of the individual note taker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.608" offset="4641834">Some of them can be made on scratch pads and pieces of paper and written upside down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.170" offset="4664090">Some can be -- some people use just keywords that -- that reveal to themselves because, of course, they notice for their own benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.966" offset="4699199">A keyword may reveal a whole massive material to the individual because he doesn't have to worry about anybody else, it's for his own benefit only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.421" offset="4737024">The one word, saw Joe Smith, as I'll try to describe later may -- may recall the history of the entire conversation with Joe Smith even if he doesn't set out all of the things that Joe Smith said to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.635" offset="4789896">The Court may think that when government agents either the Narcotics Bureau or the Federal Bureau of Investigation go out that they have a kind of form for reports for their notes, I mean, and they followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.794" offset="4834513">That is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.036" offset="4839528">They -- they follow their individual event and some of them -- some of the notes are, I should imagine, very detailed because that is the way the agent does it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.130" offset="4875891">Some other agents have -- have sketching notes, fragmentary ones using keywords just to jot their own memory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.465" offset="4905253">And there are all kinds of gradations and permutations and -- and combinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.362" offset="4924792">It can -- it can depend upon the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.352" offset="4936808">If an agent is standing up at a place talking to somebody, he can't write something very adequately in his -- in the palm of his hand on a small card or a piece of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.863" offset="4974843">He may then go back to the office and write it up more fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.729" offset="4986337">Or, on the other hand, if he is interviewing a man in the office and the man gives him a desk to sit down at, he may take fuller notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.814" offset="5014653">It may all depend upon the situation, the needs of the moment, the time at his disposal and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.748" offset="5038373">Now, the general practice, as I understand it, both of the Narcotics Bureau which is involved in this particular case and of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is that these notes are -- are sources from which the agent then uses to continue his investigation and to write a more formal kind of report such a case report, which was written in this case, and which was transmitted to the Government for use in the prosecution and -- and to the defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.053" offset="5147564">There is a whole world of difference between the things that one writes for oneself because you only have to worry about yourself and you know your -- you know your own memory, and you know how one word may reveal something to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.227" offset="5204302">There's a whole world of difference between that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.383" offset="5212871">And when you want to communicate it to somebody else and have the other person know what you are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.464" offset="5241187">Let me try to give an example to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.340" offset="5256756">Suppose the note said, “I saw Joe Smith, I saw Joe Smith.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.247" offset="5276400">And the agent got on the stand and he testified that he saw Joe Smith at a certain time, certain place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.058" offset="5299597">And he -- Joe Smith told him this and he answered that and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.465" offset="5317256">And suppose this note was used in -- for impeachment purposes and the -- the defense counsel would say, “Well, you only wrote you saw Joe Smith.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.902" offset="5351006">And the witness would say, “But that's my practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.974" offset="5363231">The words saw Joe Smith will recall to my mind the entire conversation I had with Joe Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.358" offset="5384756">That's always been my practice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.314" offset="5392593">And the defense counsel says, “Well, how do you know it's your practice?</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.810" offset="5402624">It just says you saw Joe Smith here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.484" offset="5409311">It doesn't say that -- what he said to you and what you said to him or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.041" offset="5423522">How do you know it's your practice?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.883" offset="5430941">And the -- and the witness says, “That's always been my practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.390" offset="5440972">I have that kind of a memory.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.989" offset="5447346">And defense counsel says, “Can you prove it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.213" offset="5456227">Can you bring in your other notes?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.796" offset="5462601">Well, you will then get into exactly the kind of trial confusion and collateral issues which we think that Congress was trying to avoid in the Jencks Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.737" offset="5502307">There is a probable situation with respect to the -- to summaries and other recordations which were not substantially verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.101" offset="5535744">Congress was afraid in the end that material of this kind which contained the recorder's selection, perhaps the recorder's bias, perhaps the recorder's impressions or -- or suggestions that that was not proper material for impeachment purposes that the only proper -- because it would take too long to -- to, what shall I say, strain out that portion of this recorded summary, which was really properly attributable to the witness, and that which was not, which was the -- the recorder's infusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.834" offset="5686732">Now, of course, if men were angels, that we were all perfect, juries and judges and -- and defense counsel and prosecution, and we will -- no one was confused by -- by the things you could spend days, try to figure out precisely what was attributable to the witness and what was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.269" offset="5748485">The Congress decided and -- and the common lawyers has decided that men are not angels and there is too great -- a chance of confusion and too greater chance of collateral issues delaying and -- and confusing both the jury and the -- and the parties to the trial to allow long drawn out investigations of collateral issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.701" offset="5838137">And we think the same principle is applicable to -- to personal notes which can -- as I say, vary from fragmentary jottings to the kind of narrative notes that -- as I understand Judge Learned Hand made when he was a -- a trial judge and which we're very full and very revealing to anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.481" offset="5909295">And because you can't tell, you can't tell what the notes are like because a fragment -- you don't really know whether the note is only fragmentary or not until you really investigated and find out what the agent's practice is and what his habits are and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.219" offset="5976273">That, on the whole, there is too little to begin --</text>

            <text syncTime="1834.883" offset="7442892">And that that portion of the Goldman rule which survived the Jencks Act was the part which said that where something which is -- which is not producible under the Act, but which is used to refresh recollection is still producible in the discretion of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.374" offset="7508825">In other words, we would not say that the Jencks Act and I think the legislative history, though it doesn't bear this out affirmatively in its basic premises, bares out, as I said before, the notion that Congress did not intend to abrogate the rule as to refreshing recollection either on a stand or prior to a stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.655" offset="7577997">And so that what -- what you -- if I can summarize and perhaps made myself a little clearer, if you have materials that are producible as of right under the Jencks Act, they're producible whether or not they've been used to refresh recollection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.116" offset="7627839">If you have materials which are not producible under the Jencks Act because summary as held in the Palermo case, they are not producible even in the trial court's discretion unless they are used to refresh recollection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1919.900" offset="7783006">So I come to the question as to whether there was an abuse of discretion in -- in this case.And as the Court of Appeals passed on that issue and said there was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.586" offset="7837759">And as I've already indicated, what the defense counsel did get was this voluminous case report.</text>

            <text syncTime="1948.809" offset="7898572">He had the possibility of calling Agent Bellinger of Florida State Narcotics Squad, who was the only other person aside from Dr. Needelman present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.173" offset="7940054">We also know that he did not make any effort to find out what kind of notes these were, what they bore on, how extensive they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.305" offset="7980596">And whether or not that further inquiry by him was relevant to the question of what -- whether the Jencks Act required production as of right, we certainly think it's relevant to the issue of discretion, that is that we, the Government, are right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1989.890" offset="8062934">We certainly think that it's -- it's highly relevant to the issue of discretion that the defense counsel did not seek to go further as he could have gone to find out what these notes were about under what conditions they were made, what the relation to the case report was, how fragmentary they were, how full they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.184" offset="8136077">All these things which he could have -- have gone into but he did.</text>

            <text syncTime="2310.043" offset="9343561">So, in our view, the whole duty and obligation of showing an abusive discretion was not availed itself out by the -- by the defense in this -- in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.624" offset="9397896">There's one further fact that I -- I want to mention on the question of discretion, and that is, that we know from just reading the record that the -- the defense had the case report available to it which he had only asked for it at the very end of the examination of the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.112" offset="9459858">And that it had his -- his trial -- his testimony at the prior trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.991" offset="9483368">It didn't apparently make any use of this as far as we can say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.975" offset="9495280">And this also bears on the question of whether the request of the notes here was really a serious one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.806" offset="9526627">I have come to the conclusion, I may be wrong, reading this entire record that at the trial, it had a very small role.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.899" offset="9554944">And that when the appeal stage came, it loomed much larger and that's the right of the defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.296" offset="9580544">But I don't think that the defense counsel can take such a position and -- and rely on their own luck of -- of making a record as -- as was done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.524" offset="9625475">Now, we've also made the argument that even if these materials were producible either as of right under the Jencks Act or where there was an abusive discretion by the trial judge under the -- the portion of the Goldman rule will survives that -- it was harmless in this case because of the materials which the -- the defense counsel had his ability to -- to cross-examine the agent on the basis of the case report on the agent's prior testimony, the testimony of the other agent, Agent Waters, his ability to call prior to state narcotics agent Bellinger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.093" offset="9787747">And the fact, as I have just said, that he made -- as far as we can say, no use of -- of these materials which were available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.360" offset="9816795">Again, it's indicating that the -- the failure to receive these notes did not play a significant role at the actual trial as far as this record reveals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.559" offset="9873638">In closing, if I may, I -- I would like to make -- summarize really two or three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.396" offset="9917001">And one is that we think that it's very important that if defense counsel are to claim failure to receive certain materials that they have the burden of making a proper record so that the appellate court, the Court of Appeals or this Court can make a proper disposition of that claim, that they are the ones who are asking for the materials or the evidence and under the traditional rules, as I've said, it is their duty, their obligation to make the proper record, and that they cannot rely on a failure to make the record on the mercy of -- of the Court of Appeals or of this Court really to infer that a lot of things happened which don't appear on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.938" offset="10087111">And the -- the second final statement I would like to make is about the nature of these notes and that as I said, government agents are no different from other people but they make fragmentary notes, some of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.831" offset="10134653">Some of them may make full notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.865" offset="10142804">Some make fragmentary notes, jottings, things to remind them -- them of -- of events wholly unimportant for other people because the only person they are interested in at that time was themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.199" offset="10188152">They just want to remind themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.956" offset="10195153">And for a man as reminded by one word, that's enough for himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3126.005" offset="12607404">The Government seems to try to make their distinction on whether or not the notes were communicated, and I submit that the communication adds nothing to the value of the notes, the primary point considered by this Court in the Jencks case and I think the primary point of the statute is the fact that the witness himself has, at a time, when his memory was fresh, made a notation as to what occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.369" offset="12716805">And if he just puts that in his pocket and never looks at it again until he takes the witness stand, it still just as valuable to the defense and cross-examination and just as valuable in ascertaining the truth of what actually happened at the time that he made that recording.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.706" offset="12778245">Now, this Court in Jencks, of course, over turn the idea that we -- that the defense counsel had to show any inconsistency between the prior statement of the witness as a prerequisite to having it produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.999" offset="12835401">And I think the contention of the Government now to place upon the defense, the burden, if you wish to use that word, the burden of showing that the notes would be intelligible would fall within the same category.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.621" offset="12897886">It's our position that the Jencks' case holds very clearly and very precisely that the only thing which is necessary to be shown is that the witness has made a prior statement relative to his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.452" offset="12953161">And when that appears, everything which is necessary for production purposes has been shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.181" offset="12976044">This Court in Jencks referred back to the decision in the Gordon case and said for production purposes, it need only appear that the evidence is relevant, competent and outside any exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.937" offset="13027140">When it appears that the witness who is testifying has made a prior statement concerning his present testimony, certainly his prior statement is relevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3715.067" offset="14963649">I'd like to close with just an adoption, if I may, of the words of Mr. Davis which he used before this Court in argument on Lev versus United States and other connected cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.314" offset="15016626">In arguing with reference to summaries made by agents of witnesses' testimony, it was suggesting that counsel could call the agent himself and cross-examine him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.398" offset="15065004">And in response to a question to Mr. Justice Black, that if the agent denied the purpose contained in the summary, then Mr. Davis made the statement then the memoranda could be produced since it was the agent's own document and would be producible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.098" offset="15127803">And I think that very well sums up the entire law and reason applied to this case and to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.229" offset="15160299">The notes for Rudd's own document and since it was his own document, it would be producible.</text>
