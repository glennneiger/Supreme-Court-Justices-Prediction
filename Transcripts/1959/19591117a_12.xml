            <label>Mr. Robert W. Ginnane</label>
            <text syncTime="76.468" offset="409266">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.806" offset="430582">I am appearing on behalf of the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.427" offset="453047">I'm sharing the oral argument with Mr. Thomas who represents the Pennsylvania and Santa Fe Railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.516" offset="481468">We are supported, but in brief only, by the State of Illinois and by the shippers and communities along the line of the Toledo -- Toledo, Peoria &amp; Western Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.526" offset="533504">At the outset, I would like to bring out a few additional and geographical and transportation facts from the appellants' map, because this is truly a case in which a map maybe worth a volume of testimony and logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.660" offset="602049">Your Honors may follow it -- find it easier to follow in a rather simpler map which appears at page 148 of the record, that's in volume 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.264" offset="672475">First, I'd like to refer to the appellants' historical reference yesterday that joint control of Western by Burlington and Pennsylvania brought it to ruin.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.630" offset="733915">Well at that point, the suggestion was left that this happened, the Burlington connecting with Western only at the Western end as to Santa Fe.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.359" offset="784802">Actually then and now, Burlington connected with Western not only at (Inaudible) but by this route just North of Minneapolis route coming right into Peoria, with the result that Burlington was directly competitive with the Western half -- of the Western -- Western route just as Minneapolis would be under its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.531" offset="893471">Secondly, I'd like to point out that this Pennsylvania route here, which is colored so heavily simply is not a competitive service route.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.497" offset="949373">By that I mean in terms of the condition of the track, the grace, the curves the bridges and the proof of that in the record is that in 1955, Western interchanged with Pennsylvania at Peoria 240 carloads at Effner Western exchanged with Pennsylvania 55,000 carloads.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.788" offset="1058565">I'd like to point out also that two real competitors service routes coming from the East and the Peoria are Nickel Plate coming all the way east of Buffalo and New York Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.308" offset="1120632">Now they are real competitive service routes coming from the east in the Peoria.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.589" offset="1141739">Competitive routes in the practical sense that they are fourth and fifth respectively in Western's interchange of freight.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert W. Ginnane</label>
            <text syncTime="301.830" offset="1310699">Nothing of any consequence and I don't know of any.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.210" offset="1320208">They are independent competitive carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.744" offset="1342360">The Commission found that Western now is a well-managed independently operated railroad furnishing a valuable rail transportation service to the public, and had found that the policy of Western has been and now is to maintain strict neutrality between all connections, and to participate in any haul of traffic long or short.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.815" offset="1430653">Commission characterized Western as an overhead carrier through Peoria as an alternative route bypassing the congested terminals of Saint Louis and Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.586" offset="1469733">It found that Western provides a vital direct way essential to the type of true service which is increasingly important to shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.710" offset="1506200">More than two-thirds of Western revenues are derived from overhead or bridge traffic, that is traffic which both originates and terminates on other lines and much of its remaining traffic is interline traffic, that is traffic which originates or terminates on other lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.298" offset="1592613">The Commission found that much of Western's conspicuous success as a bridge line dates from 1927, and for the first time it acquired a connection with Santa Fe at Lomax and since then the cooperation between Santa Fe, Western, and Pennsylvania has provided a highly successful competitive through route.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.894" offset="1682996">And the result of that cooperation through the years was that by 1955, Western derived 70% of its total revenues from faith interchanged with Santa Fe and/or Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.168" offset="1748093">Now Mr. McNear, the former owner and President of Western died in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.492" offset="1773380">This entire case arises out of the fact that the trustees of his estate for the diversification purposes desired to sell most or all of the Western stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.611" offset="1821863">Apart from that fact practically everybody concerned with Western's existence and operation would be quite content to see at State and the status in which it was under Mr. McNear's leadership.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.086" offset="1879751">It was against this background that the Commission had before it three proposals, the proposal of Santa Fe and Pennsylvania for 50-50 joint control through stock ownership, the proposal of Minneapolis for sole control of Western and the application of Nickel Plate in Rock Island to be included in multiple ownership with any successful applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.007" offset="1987375">A consolidated hearing was held on all of these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.515" offset="2005452">Ultimately the Commission authorized acquisition of control by Santa Fe and Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.487" offset="2037321">Minneapolis and Nickel Plate, which is no longer in the litigation, challenged the Commission's order before a three-judge court in Minneapolis and that court after a thorough review of the Commission's order, sustained it.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.156" offset="2096044">Now, I'd like to emphasize here, contrary to the suggestion in the appellants' briefs, that the District Court's action was not perfunctory, nor wasn't it an abdication of the judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.816" offset="2150588">That court in Minneapolis patiently heard all of us for six hours and we submit that its opinion goes to the heart of the issues presented to that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.427" offset="2201057">Now, the issues have shifted from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.845" offset="2210774">For example, the principal issue litigated in -- in the District Court was the contention that there was a violation of Section 10 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.061" offset="2251630">Here the principal contention seems to be that the Commission denied Minneapolis of fair hearing by determining that the public interest requires so far as possible, that continued separate and independent operation of Western under its present policies be assured and Minneapolis contends that that approach deprived it -- deprived it of a fair comparative hearing on its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.404" offset="2356955">We contend that the Commission proceeded properly under the statutory standards and the standard in Section 5 where one or more carriers seek to acquire a control of another carrier is consistent with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.468" offset="2413275">That is defined somewhat further in Section 5 which says, “The Commission shall give weight to the following considerations among others.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.601" offset="2441801">First, the effect of a proposed transaction upon adequate transportation service to the public, the effect of the public interest upon the public interest to the inclusion or failure to include other carriers -- other carriers in that same general territory, total fix charges resulting from the proposed transaction and for the interest of the carrier employees affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.364" offset="2532812">Stated briefly under the National Transportation Policy, the Commission must take into account every relevant interest of shippers, carriers, employees and the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.886" offset="2578892">The Commission's report starts out by discussing Western's physical facilities, its traffic, its roll in the transportation system, and its revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.224" offset="2616299">Then the Commission describes the applicants and the intervening carriers, and their positions, and the -- and the respective applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.166" offset="2652035">The Commission noted that the Santa Fe, Pennsylvania proposal contemplated that Western would continue to be operated as a separate and independent carrier with its separate management continuing to be at Peoria.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.887" offset="2710967">The Commission found that the Minneapolis proposal contemplates the disappearance of Western as a separate carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.904" offset="2738970">For all practical purposes, the Commission said, “Western will be integrated, consolidated, and merged into the Minneapolis for ownership, management and operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.253" offset="2772407">Western's headquarters would be removed to -- from Peoria to Minneapolis and the combined railroad operation would be run from Minneapolis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3920.588" offset="15785775">I was planning to direct most of my argument to this question of motivation and economic interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.354" offset="15824750">Mr. Ginnane has covered it at some extent and we discussed a great deal yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.418" offset="15853066">The appellant says that the economic motivations of the Santa Fe and Pennsylvania are adverse to Western's route.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.364" offset="15892877">We say that they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.831" offset="15902699">We say that those economic interests of Santa Fe and Pennsylvania will lead to the future development of Western's route, and that they will lead to its preservation as a bridge line working closely with all its connections and therefore avoid harm to the other carriers now interchanging traffic with Western.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.109" offset="16003845">Mr. Ginnane said the motive of the Santa Fe and Pennsylvania were selfish and they quite agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.733" offset="16030281">The Commission, of course, has to assume that, but the Commission was aware of the fact and it said so in this report that the Santa Fe had established the interchange at Lomax in 1927 and the success of Western dated from that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.710" offset="16110216">And the Commission knew that Santa Fe had cooperated with Western on the west and the Pennsylvania on the east and that that had developed a large volume of interchanged traffic between those two roads in Western.</text>
            <text syncTime="4018.355" offset="16176776">Now, it's quite natural when the Santa Fe and Pennsylvania learned that Western stock was going to be sold, they wanted to buy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.452" offset="16217213">To buy that stock to submit, they're already close relationship with Western, it's not for self interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.283" offset="16244485">They didn't want that relationship disturbed or destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.417" offset="16257024">It was a good thing and it was going well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.738" offset="16270294">As a matter of fact the president of the Santa Fe seriously considered purchasing Western as far back as 1942 when it was shutdown by a strike and they noted the effects of the lost of the Western service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.649" offset="16338004">So the thing was in their minds for a long time and the mind of the Santa Fe's president.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.109" offset="16355767">The Pennsylvania was less interested in purchasing Western more satisfied with things as they were, but when the time came and the stock was available, they felt they wanted to purchase it purely out of self interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.556" offset="16413550">The Commission fairly understood that because it said in substance that it had recognized in other cases the fact that they desire to protect interchanged traffic was a valid reason for purchasing a carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="4125.567" offset="16605602">There was no evidence to show that it was feasible economically that these any shippers would desire it or use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.068" offset="16635695">It was just that Mr. Sims had not wanted to have such a line competing with Pennsylvania and the reason he didn't is obvious and it goes right to this protection of interchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.322" offset="16692642">The Monon which would be part of that plan comes down here in (Voice Overlap), down here crossing in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.125" offset="16731826">Now, the idea was for Minneapolis to be combined with Western and to have a route over here to Monon and on up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.913" offset="16774980">Now, this line between Logan Port which isn't well shown on this map that is right here, and after -- under Pennsylvania, exists solely to maintain Western's connection with Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.538" offset="16829524">There are 58,000 carloads a year going over that line, that was figure for 1955 and Pennsylvania spent a million and a quarter dollars, in recent year upgrading that line to provide faster service solely in connection with Western.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.287" offset="16888560">Now, if Western is connected with this line over here, this line just goes out the window.</text>
            <text syncTime="4203.016" offset="16915414">At least, there's a serious danger that enough traffic would be lost so it wouldn't pay to maintain Logan Port line.</text>

            <text syncTime="4287.098" offset="17251767">It finally went bankrupt, but actually its revenues increased during that period of ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.515" offset="17273396">They didn't decline but its -- no go was made of it and the reason was that Burlington, with a direct line into Peoria wouldn't have any interest into supporting this west end of the line and if you want to get interchange here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.776" offset="17326477">It also has a line in Chicago and a line of Saint Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.838" offset="17338702">So the Burlington just didn't have the incentive and in the decision in which the Commission approved the Santa Fe's construction with Western of the Lomax interchange, it said that the proposed construction would aid in sustaining the west end of Western's line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.139" offset="17431907">And the story we have today, the history of the development of that interchange of the Santa Fe shows that it did.</text>

            <text syncTime="5256.247" offset="21128338">That parity policy is pretty much -- I think mixed up on -- in this argument so far and I intended to say something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.015" offset="21163447">The counsel for appellant said that this whole concept of parity was a hoax designed to mislead the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5273.274" offset="21196466">And the Commission was lead to believe that Santa Fe and Pennsylvania were going to solicit for Western and actually they wouldn't solicit a pound of freight for Western and counsel said that the Commission relied on our brief for making its parity finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.937" offset="21263130">This is not the precise answer to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, but I'll get to it in a second -- I do want to bring it out since the question came up.</text>

            <text syncTime="5301.582" offset="21309733">This is the brief before the Commission on parity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.778" offset="21326451">In explaining the proposed change in policy, it begins, now, the policy that you've mentioned was in effect on the Pennsylvania, and on the Santa Fe the policy was to solicit for Chicago but not to make any objection if the shipper decided he'd give it to Western.</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.104" offset="21415790">In substance if Santa Fe solicitor said, “Give us the freight to Chicago” and the shipper said, “I've got -- I want to give it -- I'll give it to you at Lomax” and then Western and Santa Fe says, “Alright” that was the past policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5343.899" offset="21479006">Under the new policy I'd better describe it before I read this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5347.456" offset="21493217">It's in this description.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.812" offset="21498650">I'll come to it just after I read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5351.326" offset="21508681">In explaining the proposed change in policy, Traffic Vice President Duffy stated that shippers will be advised that the Santa Fe will be satisfied with routing either via Chicago or Lomax.</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.673" offset="21558105">In other words no choice, it's up to the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.926" offset="21571062">This does not mean that the Santa Fe will solicit traffic for the T.P &amp; W.</text>
            <text syncTime="5372.808" offset="21594572">That would otherwise move by the Santa Fe to Chicago, but what it does mean that the T.P &amp; W. and its connections will be in a better position in soliciting for that traffic against the Santa Fe's Eastern connections at Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.189" offset="21652146">Now, I think that pretty well kills this hoax idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.776" offset="21674506">This does not mean that the Santa Fe will solicit traffic for T.P. &amp; W. -- for Western.</text>
            <text syncTime="5398.035" offset="21695509">Certainly the Commission was not mislead and it didn't find that Santa Fe or the Pennsylvania would solicit for Western.</text>
            <text syncTime="5405.725" offset="21726229">What it found was that the parity policy would make it powerful for Western solicitors to secure more traffic and that is what the policy means.</text>
            <text syncTime="5416.854" offset="21770742">We've covered it at pages 34 and 35 of our brief where we have reviewed the testimony that's supposed to be in contradiction of what Mr. Duffy said and in view of the time I refer you to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5430.285" offset="21824554">And then I think if you read all the testimony about parity and read the -- the transcript references are shown we'll find that it supports Mr. Duffy's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5442.812" offset="21874604">The -- the situation is simply that when the shipper knows that Santa Fe is satisfied with either Lomax or Chicago and that Pennsylvania is satisfied with either Effner or Chicago then when the T.P. &amp; W., the Western solicitors comes to this shipper and says, “Give it to us at Lomax” they will go Lomax.</text>
            <text syncTime="5469.450" offset="21981184">Maybe a shipper -- maybe a solicitor from the Erie Railroad at Chicago comes and says, “Don't give it -- give in T.P &amp; W. at Lomax, give it to us, because we don't connect to the T.P. &amp; W.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5480.245" offset="22024338">Maybe the shipper will give some of that to the Erie but it's up to solicitation by the railroads of beyond and any pressure of the Santa Fe or Pennsylvania to route -- to get the traffic routed to Chicago and not available for Lomax and Effner is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.427" offset="22097063">That is the substance of parity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.887" offset="22110960">Before I close, I want to comment very briefly on the public support to the Santa Fe-Pennsylvania application.</text>
            <text syncTime="5512.205" offset="22152234">Two briefs as Mr. Ginnane said were filed here, one, by the State of Illinois, and one by the municipalities and shippers along the line -- my time is up.</text>

            <label>Mr. Max Swiren</label>
            <text syncTime="5552.195" offset="22312103">I would like at the outset to lay one ghost, and that's the matter of reprisals by other lines for breach of neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5563.308" offset="22356616">If those are sufficient to restrain the powerful Pennsylvania and Santa Fe Railroads, how can they be less effective on the little line like the Minneapolis?</text>
            <text syncTime="5578.087" offset="22415757">And let me say to that these fine built-in checks and balances and these assurances did not prevent the Santa Fe from announcing from the witness stand that it would degrade, degrade the connection and service at Nimmo so that it can get more out of the divisions on the Lomax connection and it would cost the Minneapolis well over $1 million and subject to another $6 million of traffic to pair with.</text>
            <text syncTime="5611.788" offset="22550549">Now, the testimony given by Vice President Duffy was that he -- that Nimmo would cease to be on a parity with Lomax in his colorful words, “Service wise and every otherwise”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5626.014" offset="22607391">And if that's equality, if that's preservation of rights, I don't understand this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.688" offset="22626095">And let me say to, that the only two items of our application upon which the Commission made any findings, they didn't make on -- on service, they didn't make any -- that is on service on the public interest, they made -- a finding that on this Western, Peoria to Lomax are studies confirmed the usefulness of the property and we had no intention of abandoning it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.726" offset="22722226">And there isn't an intimation in the report that we intend to degrade it in any way and we wouldn't have any purpose for doing it, it is much, much denser.</text>
            <text syncTime="5665.110" offset="22763813">There are many of the lines in South Dakota and Minnesota, the counsel for those States are here to defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="5671.199" offset="22788159">I'd like to in the brief time I have answer three questions that you, Mr. Chief Justice put, that I don't think were met.</text>
            <text syncTime="5681.812" offset="22830582">First, was there a comparative finding? Did the Commission say, the -- the Pennsylvania-Santa Fe application is more in the public interest than the Minneapolis?</text>
            <text syncTime="5691.076" offset="22867675">The answer is no and my friend of Minnesota called attention to that in the briefs and got no response.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.530" offset="22897455">Secondly, with respect to the prior ownership, there was no comment by the Commission whatever and all this loose talk in the Commission report, in this Court and in the briefs about how the progress of Western dates and that's the word they used from the Lomax connection is contrary to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5719.858" offset="22982823">Now Mr. McNear told the Commission what happened when he asked for approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="5724.011" offset="22999437">He said, not that they didn't have a good Western connection, but he said, “It was against the interest of the controlling companies and I interpolate Pennsylvania-Burlington to develop the property because it competed for traffic with their lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="5740.217" offset="23064221">That was the reason and that was the history”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5743.000" offset="23075401">Now, there wasn't any testimony in the figures that justified the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5748.319" offset="23096613">Mr. McNear came in, in 1927 and by 1928 Western was moving 68,000 cars as against 38,000 in 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="5760.413" offset="23144991">And the total contribution of the Santa Fe at this very important Lomax connection was less than 6000 cars and those figures simply belie any notion with the rate change that took place with the Santa Fe connection and I may say that those figures do not show how much traffic had been carried by the Burlington on its Western connection and which was then lost by the replacement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5791.063" offset="23267662">A third question raise by -- by the Chief Justice that required answer and that was the finding on savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5798.882" offset="23298905">The Commission never evaluated the proposed saving program.</text>
            <text syncTime="5804.608" offset="23321788">It never said that it was wise or unwise to -- to stop using two yards and triplicate switching and duplicate facilities for repairs and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5816.167" offset="23368077">It never said that the figures we gave were not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5819.567" offset="23381661">It made no effort to meet the standard of the Interstate Commerce Act, Transportation Policy which seeks efficient economical transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5833.150" offset="23435995">With regard to this degrading at Nimmo, let me say that this is a -- this was a matter of tremendous importance and yet the Commission satisfied itself with two statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5843.941" offset="23479150">The first was that it did not know the basis for the percentage of loss which our witness testified to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5853.545" offset="23517602">Let me illustrate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5855.754" offset="23526379">There are $700,000 worth of traffic between Peoria and Nimmo on Minneapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5862.524" offset="23553442">The witness testified that he expected a loss of 75% and that went into the total of a million one and then he expected a lost of 50% on certain shipments from the territory of Santa Fe and the territory of Pennsylvania and then as to the bulk of the rest he expected 10%, 5% and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5886.741" offset="23650304">Now, the Commission -- the counsel didn't cross examine on that, he presented the figures as they asked him to, no word of cross-examination and obviously if there ever were an area in which the Commission's expertise cried out for utilization it was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5903.380" offset="23716864">If they didn't think it was 75%, they could have a judgment as to whether it were 80 or 50 or 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="5909.692" offset="23742151">That was a field in which it could function.</text>
            <text syncTime="5911.392" offset="23748942">Obviously, this is opinion, it can't be anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="5914.995" offset="23763362">Secondly the Commission says, “Let's not worry about this.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5918.718" offset="23778200">Although, they were worried about the Wabash possibly losing minute amount of traffic the details of which the Wabash did not elect to furnish, they said, “Let's not worry about this because the service is inferior.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5932.949" offset="23835146">Well the truth of the matter is that Western the service at that time was 15 minutes faster on Minneapolis, Saint Louis and it made the connection was with the same train 59 on Santa Fe that Western met.</text>
            <text syncTime="5949.747" offset="23902333">It was bad coming eastward insofar as the connection with Western's concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5955.266" offset="23924485">They have difficulty integrating their schedules, but that -- represented a very small part of the traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="5960.835" offset="23946742">Indeed it represented only 13% of the total connections at Peoria.</text>
            <text syncTime="5968.000" offset="23975372">So that the amounts involved so far as the greater sums were concerned were clearly related to traffic that moved competitively and I might say that the schedules been improved so that the (Inaudible) movement is two hours faster which shows what can be done under -- under the pressure of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5990.073" offset="24063666">I may say too that this fear of what the great Pennsylvania and Santa Fe could do is not without foundation in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5998.456" offset="24097207">The president of Santa Fe said that in solicitation their effort -- their utmost effort as he would it -- would be tremendous, and of course it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="6013.281" offset="24156453">With respect to Section 10, I should like to say that the Government went -- went to great lengths quoting from the legislative history and the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="6021.436" offset="24189158">Today they abandoned that and the reason is perfectly simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="6024.956" offset="24203160">The statute first of all was directed as the President's statement shows and the report show to strike at the concentration of economic power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6037.901" offset="24254986">This wasn't to protect one carrier or purchase price or anything of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="6042.565" offset="24273586">And one of the features of that attack on concentrated power was to attack inter corporate directorships and the first draft of the bill simply prohibited transactions between related corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6059.510" offset="24341400">There were proposals prohibited of -- interlocking directors and finally they put in a -- a saving clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="6069.508" offset="24381419">They put in the $50,000 limit and of saving clause in order to meet the special emergencies but that did not change the purpose of the act which taints this transaction from its very inception.</text>
