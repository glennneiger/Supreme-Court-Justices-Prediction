            <text syncTime="473.271" offset="1996466">This case based upon the Florida statute was brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.954" offset="2051218">Following an effort to dismiss the case and also following a motion of the summary judgment which was denied by the District Court, the case was tried and judgment was added for the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.121" offset="2131884">Following that, various motions were made and denied by the District Court and it was appealed to this Circuit Court for the Second -- Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.203" offset="2208162">There, at the argument before the court by 2 to 1 decision, this District Court was reversed on the grounds that by recognizing the Florida's -- the Florida statute and the fact that the -- the suit clause in the contract was a property right that the insurance company had been denied the due process -- had been denied due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.514" offset="2357478">The State of Florida, since a statute of the State had been, we might say, to a certain extent or declared unconstitutional, has been contrary to the Due Process Clause the Constitution of the United States, then filed a motion for rehearing as amicus curiae, but the rehearing was denied and the matter came to this Court on our petition for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.304" offset="2508570">Gentlemen, may it please the Court, we find only one case absolutely on the point apparently all to the case at bar, and that was the suit in the State of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.644" offset="2605955">It was the suit of Galliher versus State Mutual Life Insurance Company, 150 Ala.543, 43 So.833.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.023" offset="2655483">In this case, in Alabama, there was a policy written in Georgia, of far, a resident of the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.030" offset="2699473">The resident State of Georgia subsequently moved to the State of Alabama and there died.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.918" offset="2739075">There were certain reasons why no suit was prosecuted within the 12-month limit and the State of Alabama -- the Supreme Court of the State of Alabama took the position that the State of Alabama had sufficient interest in the -- in the suit so that the statute of Alabama, which is parallel to that of Florida and is quoted as the Alabama Code of 1896, Section 2802, so that the -- the laws of Alabama would control rather than the laws to the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.447" offset="2945128">It is our contention that the State of Florida had a final interest and such an interest in this matter to where the laws of the State of Florida should control, rather than the laws of the State of Illinois in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.534" offset="3013465">The policy while written in the State of Illinois, within two months, became the property of the resident of the State of -- of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.852" offset="3050768">All the property was in the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.909" offset="3062993">The loss took place in the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.386" offset="3076890">The respondent was qualified to transact business within the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.919" offset="3103013">The investigation by the insurance people was made within the State of Florida and the denial of -- of the claim was made within the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.473" offset="3157243">Now, the respondent had claimed that the only thing that -- the only interest that the State of Florida had in this -- there was the payment of the loss, if the loss had been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.186" offset="3216071">Certainly, if a resident of the State of Florida -- if the policy had been purchased in Florida, it could've had no more interest than they have under this policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.449" offset="3277197">And under the public policy of the State, which is definitely set out in Section 95.03, Florida has a right to protect a citizen of the State against a clause in any policy where -- that maybe written, which is prohibited within the State of Florida.</text>
