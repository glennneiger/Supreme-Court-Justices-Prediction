            <label>Mr. W. Lee McLane, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="10.983" offset="147310">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.549" offset="157550">Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked at the end of the last session whether we were relying upon the literal language of the statute and that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.565" offset="197674">However, in the brief, we've attempted to add some small amount of legislative history to the literal language of the statute in an effort to aid the Court in determining how this particular section should be interpreted today.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.015" offset="255457">And I would like to emphasize before I sit down a little bit of that legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.495" offset="285341">In the first place, when this Section 272 (d) was first inserted into the Revenue Act of 1926, it was the act of thought not apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.256" offset="336436">In other words Section 272 is a procedural section by which a taxpayer is afforded a method of going to the Tax Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.977" offset="387323">It is not a section which restricts the Commissioner from collecting the tax under certain circumstances as a matter of emphasis I understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.269" offset="428492">But then when Section 272 (d) was added to the Act in 1926, it provided, and I'd like to read directly from the Senate Finance Committee Report, that the law provide that where deficiency is assessed, there shall be assessed at the same time interest at the rate of 6% from the time the deficiency should've been paid to the date of assessment, in order to commit the taxpayer to pay the tax and stop the running of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.954" offset="555238">The Committee recommends in Section 274 (d), which was the predecessor of 272 (d), of the bill that the taxpayer at any time be permitted to waive in writing the restrictions on the Commissioner against assessing and collecting the tax, but without taking away the right of the taxpayer to take the case to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.197" offset="652204">Now, it is our view that since there is only one way that the taxpayer may take the case to the Board of Tax Appeals, i.e., a statutory notice of deficiency having been issued that this language simply means that a taxpayer wants to have the right to waive the restrictions against assessment and stop the running of interest after he had first received a notice of deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.418" offset="749066">In 1933, the first of the decisions of the Ninth Circuit which held these waivers to be premature and invalid was handed down and that was the case filed Mutual Lumber versus Poe.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.025" offset="799431">The position of the Court was reaffirmed in 1935 in a case entitled McCarthy versus Commissioner and those were the only two cases dealing with the validity of these waivers under Section 272 (d) until about 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.499" offset="877380">At that time, a Subcommittee of the Ways &amp; Means Committee of the House of Representatives proposed, and I quote from the language of that report, “As the result of two decisions of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Mutual Lumber versus Poe, McCarthy versus Commissioner, a valid waiver cannot be given by a taxpayer prior to the formal determination of the Commissioner as evidenced by a 60 or 90-day letter that there is a deficiency in tax.”</text>
            <text syncTime="223.233" offset="996289">Although that report was issued, no amendment was made in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.566" offset="1017605">Then in 1942, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue proposed an Administrative Procedural Code in which again, there was a provision proposed to remedy this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.262" offset="1068387">That code or proposal was not adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.342" offset="1084792">However, in 1954; the Congress finally did make a change in this section which is now before the Court, Section 272 (d), and they added the words whether or not a notice of deficiency has been added.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.357" offset="1144769">Now, the taxpayer submits that this legislative history sustains the proposition that these waivers could not be valid unless a prior notice of deficiency had first been issued.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.285" offset="1208508">-- the practice of the -- of the Commissioner between the time this 1938 proposal was made and the 1954 change in the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="288.781" offset="1258454">Did they continue to use these waivers in the manner they've been used in this case or not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_lee_mclane_jr" startTime="296.494" stopTime="370.484">
            <label>Mr. W. Lee McLane, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="296.494" offset="1289383">Yes that is correct Your Honor, except there is one interesting feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.277" offset="1304430">I was at one time with Chief Counsel's office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and at that time, they were used in the manner in which they were used in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.992" offset="1335359">However, I would like to point out to the Court that in almost every case which the Government has cited here, the waiver form was entitled at the top; waiver of right to file petition in the Tax Court of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.662" offset="1393977">Then, as a result of some of the decisions, the form of the waiver was changed and the provision at the top provided waiver of restrictions on assessment and collection of deficiency in the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.051" offset="1451551">So, that while it is true that the Commissioner has used these waiver forms in the manner which they were used here, I think the question was at least that the taxpayer knew, that is the taxpayer who was not represented by counsel, what he was waiving, because there is nothing in the terminology of the waiver form which advices a taxpayer who is not a lawyer that he is waiving his right to appeal to the Tax Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.608" offset="1557817">All it says is that he's waiving his right, waiving whatever restrictions there are on assessment and collection of the deficiency.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.284" offset="1672547">Well, of course Your Honor it's our view that it can't be waived until the notice has been issued and there has been a determination of the deficiency.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.800" offset="1802533">Well, Your Honor, it seems to me that if-- if you view these waiver forms that's concerning to an assessment or agreeing to default, in other words, that one is inclined to say that a taxpayer should not be permitted to stand upon a technical position as no notice of deficiency has been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.691" offset="1878183">I don't view them as such and I suggest to the Court that the Commissioner does not view them as such, because the very terms of the waiver itself provide that they are not a determination of the taxpayer's tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.596" offset="1933772">The note that follows at the bottom of the waiver forms states flatly that they are not the final closing agreements and that further deficiencies may be determined.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="466.200" stopTime="482.968">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="466.200" offset="1968149">You don't question about that, you can pay stopping interest, the next day buy reclaim for refund when and it's denied six months expire whichever first occurs to (Inaudible) your money back.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_lee_mclane_jr" startTime="482.968" stopTime="647.107">
            <label>Mr. W. Lee McLane, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="482.968" offset="2035231">That is true Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.831" offset="2038680">Assuming the taxpayer has the funds to pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.600" offset="2049755">In this case, there were no such funds and that's why the Commissioner was forced to sue in the District Court for judgment, in order to have that judgment in the event the taxpayer subsequently obtain funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.448" offset="2101164">I -- I know that this argument that the Commissioner makes that really this is not such a disastrous situation because taxpayer can pay the tax and subsequently sue for a refund is valid to the extent that it has a taxpayer involved who has the funds to pay a tax but there are many who do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.589" offset="2185697">And I would say that in reply to Mr. Justice Black's question that if you look at this as though it were a contract or an agreement despite what the language of the section provides that you may say that the taxpayer should be bound by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.464" offset="2277230">However, I would like to emphasize that the waiver form itself states that it is filed pursuant to the provisions of Section 272 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="552.810" offset="2314637">And now we are back to 272 (d) which gets us to the point that Mr. Justice Stewart, I'm sorry Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Brennan raised that in Section 272 (d), it states that the taxpayer shall have the right at any time to waive the restrictions on the assessment and collection of the whole or any part of the deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.289" offset="2436577">And it is the two words, “the deficiency,” which the taxpayer relies on Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.304" offset="2460609">The words “the deficiency” it seems to us must be interpreted by referring to Subsection 272 (a) which is the same section and you will find those two words in the second sentence of Section 272 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="605.732" offset="2526333">They are the last two words.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.672" offset="2542111">It says, “For a redetermination of the deficiency.”</text>
            <text syncTime="613.676" offset="2558098">A reading of that sentence refers one back to the first sentence of Section 272 (a) which states, “If the Commissioner determines that there is a deficiency in respect to the tax.”</text>
            <text syncTime="627.472" offset="2613269">And it was the view of the Ninth Circuit and it is our view that those words qualify Section 272 (d), that is, there must be a determination of the deficiency before a taxpayer may waive or file a valid waiver under Section 272 (d).</text>

            <text syncTime="669.989" offset="2783378">However, let us assume that that was the case Mr. Justice Whittaker, the -- the 30-day letter creates no rights to go to any Court to litigate or to dispute the matter except within the confines of the Treasury Department itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.207" offset="2864149">Now, the Government has used the number of taxpayers and the amount of revenue that's involved here as some indication of the importance of this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.496" offset="2949308">I of course cannot compete with the millions of dollars that may be involved but I would like to point this out to the Court that this decision, this view of the Ninth Circuit has been the law in that Circuit since 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.854" offset="3026840">The other decisions in conflict thereto had been the law since about 1939 or 1940 I think Moore versus Cleveland Railroad was decided in 1940.</text>

            <text syncTime="893.049" offset="3675617">Now, one other and final point that I'd like to make and answer to a question that was raised was whether -- I think Mr. Justice Whittaker raised that, whether a taxpayer didn't obtain a great deal of (Inaudible) by virtue of the fact that the tax could be assessed immediately after the waiver form or at the 90-day letter had been issued, immediately after the 90-day letter had been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.091" offset="3779688">The -- the Commissioner is not required to assess the tax once the 90-day letter had been issued, he may wait until the appropriate statute of limitations has expired before assessing the tax if there's no waiver form executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.941" offset="3839143">That is if a 90-day letter is issued and a taxpayer does not appeal to the Tax Court, he may wait until a year or two years has gone by assuming there is that much time left and the running of the statute of limitations for the assessment of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.821" offset="3910614">It is his practice however to assess the tax fairly shortly after the 90-days has run.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard A. Heffron</label>
            <text syncTime="1044.328" offset="4280717">I'd like to quote from the respondent's statement of the problem which gave rise to the statute under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.366" offset="4304854">He says, this prohibition is referring to the prohibitions against assessment created a problem for the taxpayer who did not wish to file a petition in the Tax Court within the 90 days but who desire that interest stopped running on a deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.619" offset="4361801">We agree with that and we say the way that taxpayer stopped interest from running on a deficiency was by filing the waiver without waiting for the 90-day letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.804" offset="4394611">If by hypothesis, he doesn't want to go to the Tax Court, why do we have to send him on and insist that he pay interest during that entire interval?</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.934" offset="4427107">That is what the position of the Government comes down to in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.437" offset="4441109">Now, there is a clear distinction between a notice of deficiency, which is the 90-day letter and the deficiency itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.266" offset="4472456">That's made very clear in the statute which defines deficiency in tax -- in Section 271.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.422" offset="4497011">As used in this chapter, deficiency mean the amount by which the tax imposed exceed the excess of the amount shown on the return, the amounts previously assessed, and this would be an amount previously assessed, or the amounts previously collected without assessment as where the taxpayer pays voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.796" offset="4574542">Now, on the other hand, the other provisions clearly distinguish the notice itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.030" offset="4595440">The deficiency is simply the liability which the Act itself creates, it doesn't matter who determines it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.139" offset="4619891">It may never be found out but the deficiency is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.582" offset="4633684">It is the true liability of the taxpayer less what he has acknowledged his -- his tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.566" offset="4657612">For example, 272 (c) provides that the taxpayer does not file a petition in the Tax Court, the deficiency, notice of which has been mailed to him shall be assessed which clearly distinguishes the deficiency itself from the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.986" offset="4727306">The very section we're discussing here distinguishes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.619" offset="4741831">It says, “No assessment of a deficiency shall be made until notice has been mailed to the taxpayer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.892" offset="4778924">So, the deficiency is a concept entirely distinct from the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.563" offset="4793657">And it's the Government that is relying on the definition as contained in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.718" offset="4818213">When the waiver provision says you may waive restrictions on the deficiency, the deficiency is not a notice of deficiency it is the liability which is created by the statute less the offsets such as whatever is acknowledged on the return or has been previously collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.532" offset="4893550">The entire administrative process, the Internal Revenue Service, from the moment an agent appears on the premises to examine the return is designed to procure one of two results, either to procure agreement from the taxpayer that he will pay the proposed additional amount of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.615" offset="4969827">In which case the taxpayer signs an 870 to stop the running of interest, because since he's already agreed to pay this amount, there is no reason to go forward with the rest of the administrative procedure and provide him with a 90-day letter or if the taxpayer does not agree to the proposal, he has successive layers of review within the Internal Revenue Service, he can go to a group chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.699" offset="5062196">He can file -- get a 30-day letter and protest and go to the Appellate Division which is part of the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.902" offset="5086960">If all of these means avail not to reach a settlement of the dispute, he receives a 90-day letter, so that he can go to the Tax Court if he wants to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.469" offset="5121233">You are making perhaps another fact that if the deficiency was there, all the notice does is to identify it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1263.066" offset="5155610">The notice is the identification by which the taxpayer can go to the Tax Court and dispute something alleged by the Commissioner as due over and above that, which he has acknowledged is due on his return or in some other way as by the waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.145" offset="5211930">But at every stage of the administrative process as these -- these literally thousands and thousands of controversies between agents and taxpayers are resolved, at every stage the taxpayer's afforded an opportunity, if he agrees with the proposed additional tax, to sign a waiver that closes the case out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.472" offset="5285282">There is no need to go to the Tax Court; there is no need to issue a 90-day letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.720" offset="5302209">We're stopping the running of interest on behalf of the taxpayer because the Government can immediately collect it and if the Government can collect it, then there's nothing to take to the Tax Court because there is no deficiency.</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.911" offset="5387055">Well that is the difference between the two routes Congress has established to contest tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.635" offset="5405863">Now, there's no question here as respondents seem to imply of whether the taxpayer understood this waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.525" offset="5433448">He had full opportunity below and the District Court to raise any question of a stopple of misrepresentation of anything which would impair the binding effects of the waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.067" offset="5475662">That was not done; there is no question of that sort at all in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.373" offset="5492903">As the Government sees that the only question here is construction of the statute and whether when Congress said that no assessment shall be made until a notice has been mailed whether that notice is not a restriction which the taxpayer can waive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.339" offset="5552776">Now, we say it is clear under the statute that that is a restriction that the taxpayer can waive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.106" offset="5579839">Now, the respondent has also referred to a Committee report of 1938 which indicates that these cases in the Ninth Circuit had held, there was an invalid waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.482" offset="5637308">Committee also said, “Your Subcommittee, while feeling that the language of the statute is already sufficiently clear, feels compelled to do precisely what was done in the 1954 Code just to make sure.”</text>
