            <text syncTime="28.279" offset="216482">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.983" offset="227349">We come here from the Third Circuit on certiorari, extremely proud that Chief Judge Biggs and Circuit Judge Hastie agreed with us in this three to two decision under the Hobbs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.114" offset="303835">The charge under the Hobbs Act was an obstruction or interference with interstate commerce by extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.630" offset="329853">The sufficiency of evidence of extortion is not here today, but just at the beginning I think I should say it was hotly contested and you should know that this alleged extortionist was paid by check and paid his income tax on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.318" offset="396622">He's a labor leader accused of having shaken down a manufacturer by threatening him with labor trouble, but none of the labor leader's men worked for that manufacturer, none of the labor leader's men worked for his suppliers and none of the labor leader's men worked for his customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.522" offset="477497">As I say, the defendant was indicted for obstructing or interfering with commerce between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.846" offset="506755">Our first point of our two points here today is that he was indicted for one obstruction of commerce, but the jury was permitted to convict him of another obstruction of commerce for which he was never indicted and our second point which is two-fold, involve the arguments that they admittedly purely local actions of the defendant had no sufficient effect upon commerce between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.763" offset="646457">The evidence showed that there was sand in the bottom of the Ohio River between West Virginia and Ohio and a company called the Ducane Sand Company dredged or dug it up and sold it from out of Ohio or West Virginia or both to a company in Pennsylvania called Ducane Slag Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.839" offset="810715">Another company called Crane Brothers brought the sand up the Ohio River and then up the Monongahela River to the Brady Street Yard of the Ducane Slag Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and maybe once or twice to another place, but in general to the Brady Street Yard of Ducane Slag Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.494" offset="925341">Ducane Slag Company, which had a lot of other customers also, sold some of this sand to a man named Rider, who was a manufacturer of concrete and the sand was sent over from the Brady Street Yard to another property of Ducane Slag at Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania where Rider did his business of manufacturing concrete on property owned by Ducane Slag.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.634" offset="1081866">At Belle Vernon the last place I named and no interlocking relationship in the ownership between the Rider Supply Company and either of the -- or in any other company in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.940" offset="1131081">The indictment which appears at page 6-A or commences there is one that the Government construes differently than I do and therefore in this case I will take a moment to say what's in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.694" offset="1202134">The indictment, page 6-A, charges a part of the commerce between the States was the transporting of materials used in the construction of a steel mill and that this man Rider who is going to turn out to be the alleged victim of the alleged extortion had caused a movement of such material in commerce toward his concrete manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania and that the defendant had obstructed commerce and the movement of the aforesaid material in it by extorting $30,000 from Rider.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.699" offset="1362213">Now the defendant, none of whose men worked for this man Rider or his suppliers or his customers said that he had obtained a very profitable contract for Rider and that the checks on which he paid income tax was preventative commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.270" offset="1420413">He will notice in the indictment that Stirone, the defendant appellant was indicted for obstructing the receipt in interstate commerce of sand to be used in manufacturing concrete and that all he was indicted for.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.184" offset="1504110">So far what some people sometimes call a technicality, that's all they had any right to try him for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.793" offset="1542562">The only obstruction of commerce they had any right to try him for, was the obstruction of the receipt of sand, moving toward the concrete manufacturing plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.646" offset="1593971">Of course, it's a technicality of great importance and unless it continues to exist as an important part of our Law, it will just mean that the baron shouldn't have bothered to go to any meeting in the first place because he could only be tried for something he's charged with.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.800" offset="1662621">But over objection at page 51-A, and the objection was based on the ground of materiality which seemed to me would have been exactly the right ground, other objection, the Government at the trial of this indictment was allowed not only to produce evidence that the receipt of sand that they're receiving him might have been obstructed or interfered with, but was also allowed to produce evidence that that sand was used to make concrete and that that concrete was supplied by this man, Rider, to the prime contractor and was used by the prime contractor to help build a steel mill, the Pittsburgh Steel Company and then after the steel mill was built, it shipped hot -- it's called hot room sheet and strip metal from Pennsylvania to the automotive industry, principally in Michigan.</text>

            <text syncTime="549.076" offset="2299695">We say that that was very lacking in any element of due process of law and that if anything went to this jury at all, it should only have been an obstruction or interference with sand at the receiving end.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.986" offset="2363329">The Government says that the matter was not made an issue at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.045" offset="2379525">I can only answer that questioning if we only know of one way to plead the general issue and that's by a plea of not guilty and we've entered a plea of not guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="937.831" offset="3854712">But not as completely as I make it here, as to the steel after he mentioned the sand.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.824" offset="3886686">Now the other question in the case involves whether this alleged interference was the purely local activity of manufacturing concrete had such an effect on commerce between the States that it could be the subject to this prosecution and of course I should start with the fact, I know perfectly well that by scholastic reasoning involving what somewhat -- someone called abstract notions, everything affects commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.439" offset="4029106">And that the statute in this case is very sweeping at what it tries to reach and probably reached about as much as any statute one could possibly pass but I still claim that the effect upon commerce in this case was not only too distant, but also too unsubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.119" offset="4107891">That has two aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.684" offset="4114160">First as to the sand, you remember that Rider, the alleged victim of this extortion, was in Pennsylvania and that in Pennsylvania, he purchased the sand from Ducane Slag Company which was also in Pennsylvania which had lots of other customers and that Slag Company was the one who purchased sand from Ducane Sand Company in another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.290" offset="4244564">Now, the theory by which the trial judge and by which today the Government says that extortion directed against anyone as remotely connected with commerce between the States that this man Rider can be tried in federal court appears at pages 306-A and 307-A of the record where the Trial Judge in his opinion frankly said, starting five lines up from the bottom of 306-A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.616" offset="4401821">That statement was based upon a premise that a deliberate act which tends to prevent Articles from being used, once they have reached their destination, after being shipped in interstate commerce, then it is up the stream of commerce and delays and obstruct and defect interstate commerce as surely as though the same act had cut off the supply at short.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.018" offset="4503489">So what they're really contending here today and they cite United States versus Sullivan as they contended in their brief, what they're really contending here today is that an extortion or a robbery because the Hobbs Act covers robberies also, an extortion or a robbery which would prevent a corner druggist from selling something to a customer which had originally come from another state is an extortion or robbery which can properly be made and has been made the subject of federal jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1516.608" offset="6169788">And those two judges were also with us or if one Chief Judge and one other judge were also with us in the (Inaudible) which is that if I must assume as I hate to do, that it was alright to submit the issue of interfering with the shipment of steel products to this jury, if I have to assume that, then I say that under the decisions of this Court, the shipment of those steel products from a plant which had been built partly out of concrete by a prime contractor for whom Mr. Stirone -- pardon me, for whom the subcontractor who was the victim of the alleged extortion has made the concrete is again a matter in which the relationship between the alleged extortion from Rider who made the concrete or rather mention the prime contractor who made the factory with somebody else placed machines that makes steel products that went to somebody else from Detroit was again not close enough in its relationship to interstate commerce to use one part of Mr. Chief Justice Hughes' phrase and as well as not being close enough, it wasn't substantial enough in its relationship to the shipment of the steel product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.161" offset="6488064">For one reason, as Judge Hastie points out, there's nothing to show that there were plenty of other resources of concrete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.538" offset="6517530">This is no question of a monopoly as in your Sherman Act cases and when supported properly going to authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.691" offset="6550131">I should add one more thing that at the time of the extortionate demand, no sand was being received directly from other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.154" offset="6587956">It was coming in to the Brady Street Yard of the Slag Company, was being unloaded and piled up there, mixed with other sand from Pennsylvania and then eventually sent away by railroad car to Rider, the alleged victims at the time of extortionate demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.505" offset="6649396">Later on, the sand moved in the way I told Mr. Justice Whittaker when I responded to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.582" offset="6669667">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.114" offset="6695790">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.094" offset="6707702">As counsel for the petitioner says there's no question here about the fact of the extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.561" offset="6725569">We're concerned only with the commerce element.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.755" offset="6738422">He's giving you most of the facts and I would to like to clear up a few details particularly in the sand commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.166" offset="6764022">The relationship of the companies I believe Mr. Justice Whittaker asked about, the sand, the Slag Company owns 49% of the sand company which does the dredging.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.382" offset="6816893">The other 51% is owned by the towing company, the Crane Brothers who own the tugs that handle the barges for both companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.273" offset="6860466">It's true that the sand was sold by the dredging company to the slag company and not directly to Rider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.010" offset="6891395">That was by the relationship between those two companies, all of their production was taken by the slag company and also by the terms Rider's lease, he was required to take his sand from the slag company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.994" offset="6955342">So the slag company did buy the sand from the dredging company and paid for it and then charged Rider for the sand that was directed to go to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.057" offset="6995571">Now the physical movements however of the sand were in most cases direct from the barge from the dredge in West Virginia to Rider's plant in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.105" offset="7051786">The barges were taken upstream by the towing company, pass Brady Street which was the plant of the slag company in Pittsburgh and then up another 25 miles to Rider's plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.559" offset="7105599">Sometimes they were docked temporarily in Pittsburgh at the Brady Street Yard and thereafter picked up by the towing company and taken on upstream but they were never unloaded nad we don't think it makes any difference that the barges did stop temporarily at Brady Street but that some of them did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.431" offset="7189086">Also, as to the matter of the shipments at the time of the extortionate demand, I think it is probably true that at that time the shipments were by rail that however was because the dock wasn't finished at Rider's plant, that was finished in October of 1951, the contract went on until well in the 1954 when the extortion continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.132" offset="7311862">On the steel commerce, the only fact that was necessary to establish was that the steel mill upon completion would sell its goods in interstate commerce and that testimony was given.</text>
