            <text syncTime="12.836" offset="154728">Members of the Supreme Court, this is a negligence case under the Federal Employers' Liability Act and the action was tried in Summit County town police court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.297" offset="208541">A verdict was rendered for the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.260" offset="216377">A general verdict was rendered for the plaintiff and in addition to the general verdict, there were two interrogatories submitted by the railroad and the first was, “Do you find the defendant was negligent?”</text>
            <text syncTime="41.079" offset="267682">The answer by the jury to that special interrogatory was, “Yes, in part.”</text>
            <text syncTime="45.816" offset="286595">And the second interrogatory was, “In what -- if your answer to interrogatory number one is in the affirmative, then in what respect do you find the railroad was negligent?”</text>
            <text syncTime="57.916" offset="335078">And the answer was, “In failing to provide enough protection.”</text>
            <text syncTime="63.127" offset="355871">The Court rendered a judgment on the verdict, the town police court did and the railroad appealed to the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals reversed and rendered a final judgment, took the judgment away from the petitioner, rendered the final judgment in favor of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.149" offset="427969">This accident occurred at a railroad crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.815" offset="442598">The plaintiff was a crossing watch and he was in the performance of his duty when he was struck by an automobile at the crossing while the train was passing over the crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.992" offset="495365">It -- it was the most unusual crossing in that Tallmadge Avenue is a main highway on Akron, extending in an easterly and westerly direction and Home Avenue is -- is a highway extending in a north-easterly and south-westerly direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.656" offset="562030">They intersect one another and the railroad tracks of the defendant or the respondent, three of them, intersect both highways right in the middle of the intersection.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.980" offset="607274">So that we -- we have a situation there where Home Avenue intersects Tallmadge Avenue, west of the tracks and it also intersects Tallmadge Avenue, east of the tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.581" offset="653667">There are actually two intersections there, thus providing a cutoff for automobiles that are proceeding in a northerly direction on Home Avenue into -- into Tallmadge Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.822" offset="706644">On this particular night, there was a train, a train that was travelling in an easterly direction north geographically and it was the watchman's duty to take his position on the westerly side of the railroad track and face the train for the purpose of watching for another train which was due out of Ravenna, Ohio and which had left Ravenna, Ohio by 15 minutes before that time, and in order to not clear the crossing before this other train arrived in the event it did arrive before the train which is on the crossing passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.591" offset="865782">While he was standing there facing the train, the train that was passing was -- the caboose was going over the crossing and he took a step backward and went to turn, when he was struck by an automobile, which was being driven in a northerly direction on Home Avenue and the -- the driver was making a left hand turn on this cutoff which is located west of the railroad tracks, struck the watchman, a 67-year old man and seriously injured him.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.330" offset="992737">And he -- we sued the railroad -- the railroad was sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.443" offset="1017187">The driver sped on.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.312" offset="1024606">He was a hips -- hit-skip driver.</text>

            <text syncTime="600.709" offset="2506167">Does that answer your -- I think that's the -- now, the Court of Appeals in -- in reversing and taking the judgment away, held that because this man violated traffic ordinances or traffic statutes that the defendant railroad was exculpated from any liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.816" offset="2614627">They said the -- the approximate cars of this accident and the injuries to this watchman was the negligence of a man by the name of Ball who was driving this car and that in view of the fact that he violated several traffic laws, that -- that exculpated the railroad company.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.112" offset="2695816">Now, Your Honors, in -- in the case -- have passed on this matter before and the case of Cahill, Cahill versus New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, at -- in that case, which went up from one of the New York courts and the Court of Appeals reversed and held that the -- the negligence of the automobile driver, the violation of the ordinance exculpated the driver in a 2-to-1 opinion, this Court reversed and remanded and gave the verdict back in that case as I remember, gave the judgment back.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.897" offset="2858924">The -- the -- there were -- there was a minority opinion in the Court of Appeals and in the minority opinion, the Court stated that he -- he didn't think that as a -- the Court could say as a matter of law that had this man, this watchman then permitted, our claim here is that if this watchman had been permitted to face the traffic, face Home Avenue and face Tallmadge Avenue, he would have had an opportunity to step aside or take a step backwards and avoided being injured under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.504" offset="3013360">Now, the evidence in this case is that he had to face the train to watch for this other train which was coming due there from the opposite direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.549" offset="3061530">Although he did not testify to the fact, the conductor, a witness for the railroad, conductor on the train was -- which was passing over the crossing, testified that he also had the duty to watch for hot boxes, as that train was proceeding on the crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.148" offset="3135927">Now, it's our claim that under the evidence in this case and there was positive testimony here of the fact that this -- that the petitioner had to face the train and was facing the train at the time this occurred, there was -- the testimony here, the pictures and the map shows the -- the extra hazardous condition of this particular crossing and specially in the night time.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.280" offset="3260479">We say that under all of those facts, this was a question for the jury as -- and those were all probative facts for the jury and certainly there were enough facts here to justify the inference that the railroad company failed to exercise ordinary care to furnish this man, this plaintiff or petitioner with a safe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.854" offset="3358804">I think I'll reserve the rest of my argument to Mr. Kelly.</text>

            <text syncTime="821.835" offset="3390673">Mr. Chief Justice, Members of this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.347" offset="3416795">At the very upset we wish to say that I think this case must be determined on the law as laid down by the Rogers case, with which you are all familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.534" offset="3493491">Now, the test which was prescribed in that case which at the outset, I wish to quote if I may is simply this as stated by Mr. Justice Brennan, speaking of the FELA statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.506" offset="3557439">You there said and I quote, “Under this statute, the test of a jury case is simply where that approves justifiable reason, the inclusion that the employ of negligence played any part even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought.”</text>
            <text syncTime="885.798" offset="3646568">The time of the trial of this case, the Rogers case had not been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.184" offset="3680110">However, upon appeal to the Court of Appeals and upon an appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio, the Rogers case was unsuccessfully erred by counsel for petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.228" offset="3748237">It was and is our position and it's a very simple one that the facts of this case do not show or do not make a jury question under the test laid down in the Rogers case.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="929.373" offset="3820857">Does the Court of Appeals opinions cite the Rogers case?</text>

          <turn speaker="william_a_kelly" startTime="931.555" stopTime="1401.137">
            <label>Mr. William A. Kelly</label>
            <text syncTime="931.555" offset="3829635">It does not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.400" offset="3836949">But it was -- Rogers case was urged in the briefs in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.444" offset="3861191">Now, why do we say that and what is the basis for that statement?</text>
            <text syncTime="946.964" offset="3891179">This is a long record, but from this record, we have attempted to call for this Court certain facts concerning which here can be no-dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.481" offset="3953246">And those facts are related in perhaps, greater brevity in the opinion of the Court of Appeals and constitute or set out the basis for the opinion reached by the Court of Appeals in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.534" offset="4013537">Let us look at the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.164" offset="4023986">This crossing was adequately equipped with a two-way signal system which indicated to the watchman, both inside and outside the watchman's shanty of the approach of any train from either direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.769" offset="4106428">This signal system went into operation when a train, a northbound train or an east bound train was pointed too hard in 15 feet east or west of the crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.961" offset="4163166">The signal system went into play when a westbound train was approximately 2000 feet in the crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.343" offset="4192737">This system had been in existence for many months and was well known to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.867" offset="4218859">The east and westbound tracks in this area were equipped with an automatic signal system, so that the block signal where east of the crossing, could be lighted when an eastbound train was 2250 feet -- 15 feet west of the crossing and the block signal west of the crossing could be -- would be lighted when a westbound train was 3450 feet east of the crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.361" offset="4340799">Now the petitioner had full knowledge of the operation of that block six system -- signal system in that particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.481" offset="4377266">The crossing was equipped with a four-way, highway automatic electric flashers which would activate when an eastbound train was 2000 feet from the crossing and which would seize to activate when that train was suddenly 5 feet east to the crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.864" offset="4462843">Now on each street, there were statutory highway railroad crossing signs as prescribed by the law of Ohio, visible to travelers on the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.705" offset="4526164">And the petitioner had knowledge of those highway signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.190" offset="4548106">Tallmadge Avenue was a statutory and municipal through or main highway clearly marked with properly erect statutory signs as required by the law of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.583" offset="4605680">And under that law, it was a duty of travelers, before proceeding onto Tallmadge Avenue from the south or the north to bring the automobile to a stop and to yield the right of way to vehicles on Tallmadge Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.139" offset="4671927">Now, Mr. McGowan has mentioned the element of lighting, the record of this case by the admission of the petitioner himself shows that this crossing was well lighted and not only that, when he stood there, two or three feet west of the west of the westbound track, he stood within the full rays of an automobile whose headlights were directed east and were so apply -- were -- were signing right on the petitioner and the photographs and the plots show the location of the lights in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.134" offset="4831901">The atmospheric and weather conditions were clear and dry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.255" offset="4852381">Petitioner was an experienced watchman, he had worked at this crossing for about seven years and for the past three years he had worked at night from 11:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. -- 7:00 a.m.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.477" offset="4925315">Petitioner was in good health and in full possession of his mental and physical faculties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.937" offset="4955094">Respondent has provided the petitioner with lanterns, fuses, whistles and other safety devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.680" offset="4998144">Petitioner was familiar with the train schedules and knew when and how to look for the approach of trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.907" offset="5030954">The train involved in this accident only incidentally, consisted of a steam engine, 80 gondola cars having a weight of -- having a height of seven to eight feet and was moving the speed of 12 to 18 miles per hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.678" offset="5090095">The duties which petitioner was performing at this time were no different than those which he had performed for many, many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.531" offset="5129488">Now, petitioner was standing as has been indicated, at the west side of the tracks and in the position so testified by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.884" offset="5166895">And while in that position, keeping in mind that his claim, that his attention was diverted to a westbound train coming from this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.899" offset="5207019">If he was in that position as he says he was, then all he needed to do was to look at the signal block to the west and to the signal pole with the light on at the shanty and observe the presence of a train.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.854" offset="5270758">Not only that, he had not heard any whistle, he knew that a train had left Ravenna, a distance of some 15 or 18 miles, if I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.671" offset="5322062">Now, what happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.225" offset="5336273">Plaintiffs -- petitioner says this, he says that as he stood there, he looked to his right or to the west and in so doing, he would have to look right at Home Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.104" offset="5407744">And when he looked at Home Avenue, he saw vehicles proceeding northerly on Home Avenue, come up to the crossing and stop, pursuant to the flashers and the other signals there existing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.335" offset="5472737">He says this, that after he saw the caboose back at Home Avenue crossing or about 100 feet from where he was, if that be true and he says he looked at the block signal, then he could have seen that there was no westbound train approaching at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.739" offset="5562284">There was no evidence in this lawsuit, nothing to suggest that the respondent in anyway violated any federal or state or local law or any applicable rule or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.689" offset="5618082">No watchman had ever been injured or killed on this process, nor was their any evidence that there had been any other or similar occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.052" offset="5671581">Now, what happened, what was the cause of this accident?</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.138" offset="5691956">The cause of this accident was simply this --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1401.137" offset="5707943">Mr. Kelly, before you proceed, how do you -- how do you read the testimony that call our attention or you'd rather -- hearing on page 68, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.873" offset="5746813">In connection with the statements you just made that there was no evidence at all of any similar occurrence?</text>

            <label>Mr. William A. Kelly</label>
            <text syncTime="1416.587" offset="5769697">I interpret that in this fashion, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.881" offset="5786937">This witness used the expression, “jumping the gun.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.489" offset="5813373">Now, this petitioner had worked on this crossing for seven years and at nighttime and at daytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.010" offset="5851408">He didn't testify and there was no evidence, there's no evidence -- there is no evidence in this record that a person who would be travelling northerly on Home Avenue, approaching Tallmadge Avenue, would suddenly cut to the left and move in on this 15-foot strip, that's my interpretation of that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.842" offset="5950777">If that had been a practice, if that had existed, if that had happened in the past, certainly the plaintiff or the petitioner would have had some knowledge of that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.169" offset="5996022">Jumping the gun, I assume is nothing more or less in what we see people do when they come up to a -- a stop sign or a railroad crossing, somebody is in a hurry to get out ahead of the procession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.601" offset="6049729">Now what happened here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.095" offset="6059760">Here, we have an admitted, intoxicated driver, a hit-skip driver, the testimony shows that he pulled up within that line of traffic and he was in the second or the third or fourth car, south of the railroad crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.457" offset="6137187">There were other cars back of him, now what does he do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.423" offset="6157040">All of a sudden after the caboose cleared Home Avenue crossing, this man takes off and he goes up and the record shows this, the record showed, he goes up about to the first rail of the most westerly track and then he suddenly swings to the left and runs right into the petitioner, turns off his light and speeds away in the nighttime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.224" offset="6272293">He was intoxicated and the record so show.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.197" offset="6288175">Now when this man did that, he violated and this as appears in the record in the Court of Appeals so found and Mr. McGowan does not dispute it, this man violated five traffic regulations or laws of the State of Ohio and yet, we are charged with the failure to foresee conduct of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.855" offset="6386813">Now, that's his lawsuit, gentlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.683" offset="6402069">This Court has said the access that negligence is a basis of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.069" offset="6431640">Furthermore, it is the law that there must be causation between negligence and injury or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.475" offset="6477302">Any way you look at the record in this case, can it be said that the railroad company, the employer here, failed to exercise his judgment?</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.705" offset="6542190">It's common sense, its fair beliefs in not providing this man with a safe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.198" offset="6576149">It is significant that over all the years so far as I can find and apparently so far as Mr. McGowan has not able to find any cases in which this Court has said that a watchman has a right to recover damage or has a right to submit his case to jury under circumstances such as we have on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.588" offset="6681684">The absence of such cases, indicate it's rather absurdity of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.610" offset="6701850">On the contrary of that --</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.524" offset="6753468">Sometimes the Public Utilities Commission makes an order requiring a watchman to be maintained at certain crossings, but there's nothing in this record to indicate that any such order was made by the Utilities Commission as to -- with respect to this particular crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.110" offset="6839777">Now, briefly and I shall close.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.325" offset="6864645">We have been able to find and we cite in our brief, three cases in which two in North Carolina and two in Ohio for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals before, Your Honor, Judge Potter was on that Court in which the Court held as a matter of law, there was no liability upon the part of the railroad company for injuries sustained by a watchman or a member of a train crew even, due to the conduct of a traveler on the highway who comes out in the light or out of the daytime and runs into a railroad employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.549" offset="7045517">Now, some mention has been made by Mr. McGowan about the Cahill case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.959" offset="7067251">That can be answered very briefly and simple that Cahill case was simply a case where a 21-year old inexperienced brakeman, was a member of a train crew and working and switching operations in a street, I believe, up in New Haven and he was injured by a traveler on the highway or motorist on the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.109" offset="7163800">In that case, there was evidence of -- of nine similar prior accidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.227" offset="7196296">We do not have any of those elements in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.718" offset="7214268">Now, the sole proximate cause of this accident was a negligence of this drunken driver, the only person who was negligent was this drunken driver and therefore, is it any reason why the Court of Appeals can conclude it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.595" offset="7297755">And why do (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <text syncTime="1815.539" offset="7365569">The only way I could answer that, Your Honor, is by referring to page 4 of the reply brief of the petitioner, the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.331" offset="7412694">It -- I'll look down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.588" offset="7429726">In other words, keeping in mind that petitioner had the opportunity to see and did see there was no question about this in his record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.993" offset="7487300">Traffic on Home Avenue, the only thing that's left as I view this case, is whether or not it can be said that there is a jury question because of the failure of the railroad company to have another watchman somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.114" offset="7575803">And so I close and I ask this rhetorical question, is it to be the law of this Court applicable to FELA cases that a railroad employer shall respond in damages because of a failure to have a watchman to watch the watchman?</text>

            <text syncTime="1897.630" offset="7693876">If the Court please, here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.800" offset="7702549">Mr. Kelly raised a question about the signal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.901" offset="7722924">Now, there isn't any question, but what he was supposed to watch were the other train that was coming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.656" offset="7742046">They claim that there were signals there and that he could've looked at the signals, but in any event, he would've had to have his back to traffic on Tallmadge Avenue and traffic on Home Avenue, had he watched the signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.968" offset="7791261">But he states why he -- he couldn't see the signal on this particular night because this was a long freight train and he -- and he says on page 17 of the record, “What was your reason for looking towards (Inaudible), the answer, “One, to see if there was a reflection of the headlight coming around the curve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.648" offset="7862000">I couldn't see the light down at East Avenue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.865" offset="7874853">Question, “Why couldn't you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.320" offset="7880704">Answer, “The eastbound train was blocking it, so that he had look to the left and when he looked to the left and in the north, his back had to be to Home Avenue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.040" offset="7931486">Now, then he says -- Mr. -- Mr. Kelly says what can they do, what could they do to protect this man?</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.864" offset="7962833">Well in the first place this was an extra hazard at crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.204" offset="7980178">If they permitted this man to face traffic after -- after that train started across the crossing, if they wouldn't have shouldered on him, the additional duties of -- of watching for this train which was coming in the opposite direction and the additional duties of watching for hot boxes and their conductor, Mr. Peterson, stated that he -- that was one of his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.389" offset="8108910">Now then, if they would've permitted him to face traffic, face traffic on Home Avenue and Tallmadge Avenue, it's our contention that he would have been able to step aside or do anything to avoid being struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.127" offset="8171917">Now, one of the members of the Court asked about this drunken driving.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.149" offset="8191979">There was one witness that the railroad brought in, a man that -- that was driving behind this person that testified about three or four blocks away and it's in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.655" offset="8242030">He had -- had gotten up and had an argument with this man and that he smelled liquor on his breath and that in his opinion, he was intoxicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.162" offset="8284035">That's the only evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.386" offset="8288946">Mr. Inman was taken to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.161" offset="8296051">We have no way, we didn't know who this witness was, but that was -- that was the only evidence of any intoxication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.248" offset="8328338">Now, then, in addition to that, if the Court please, we have evidence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.128" offset="8363865">There's evidence in this case that -- there's ample evidence in this case that if this man, if this man's -- what actually happened there is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.467" offset="8441292">The negligence of this fellow Ball was enlarged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.701" offset="8454144">We claim his negligence was enlarged by the fact that --- that the plaintiff, the petitioner had to have his back to traffic at this particular intersection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.314" offset="8492596">Now, Mr. Kelly made a statement that there wasn't any evidence that traffic ever made a left hand turn from Home Avenue into -- into Tallmadge Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.285" offset="8536482">Now, we'd like to refer this Court to the exhibits in this case which are found here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.171" offset="8564067">The -- the contour, the street and the tracks on the street show that traffic was heavy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.785" offset="8586533">Plaintiff's Exhibit 11, page 216 of the record and even the defendants, one of the defendant's exhibits, shows that traffic was heavy and that exhibit number is defendant's Exhibit E, which is found at page 227.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.283" offset="8672528">That shows that traffic was heavy on the intersection west of the railroad tracks from Home Avenue into Tallmadge Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.835" offset="8714742">Now, we claim that under all of this evidence, there was a factual situation there for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.614" offset="8737834">The jury resolved the facts in favor of the plaintiff and under the decision of Judge Brennan in the Rogers case, all of these facts, the condition of this crossing the nature of it, the fact that there were -- that this intersection come in from Home Avenue into Tallmadge Avenue and was not blocked-off thereby permitting traffic to move and make a left hand turn while that man was on duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.355" offset="8844831">All of those were factual situations along with the fact that he had his back to traffic which the jury had a right to consider and they resolved those questions in favor of the plaintiff and the Court of Appeals presumed to take it upon themselves to overrule the jury and incidentally, they -- they -- the Rogers case had been decided before the case was heard by the Court of Appeals, but instead of referring to the Rogers case, they cited the Ohio jurisprudence on negligence.</text>
