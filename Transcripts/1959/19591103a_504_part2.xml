        <section startTime="0" stopTime="2195.837">
          <heading>Argument of J. Lee Rankin</heading>
          <turn speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="0.000" stopTime="358.578">
            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- to answer a question for Mr. Justice Frankfurter and I was trying to describe a little bit of the problem in regard to trying to furnish to you on whether or not plans that are not struck could furnish it.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.708" offset="226200">I think one of the difficulties in regard to the affidavits in this case is that the union's affidavits very largely treat steel as though it was a fungible commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.449" offset="281161">It is of course when you deal with the ingots but when you get beyond that, you have so many and very great problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.258" offset="316374">There are so many shapes and forms and sizes, thousands of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.739" offset="338317">And then you've also get into qualities of various kinds of stainless cobalt and alloys, some 35 different alloys that to try to assume that just because a supplier either a plant -- steel plant as they call it or a warehouse had any such material that you needed for defense contract just because they had a thousand tons of items that were steel is an impossible assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.023" offset="487424">When the contractors are seeking a particular commodity, they need something that will fit the design but they're given by the defense department and it isn't the right shape or form, if that's the problem of course, it's of no value.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.461" offset="549177">One of the problems we have now, with a large inventory which is not bound completely it's around seven million tons from about almost 25 that it was at the beginning of the strike and it's going down at some five million a month, it's the figure that is given.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.652" offset="634023">Even with that, there are many items that contractors are unable to find that will fit with the things that they have in supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.852" offset="682820">And it's of course useless to try to have just a half a car or a railroad wheel when you need axle to go with it or other parts of the steel product that you're trying to develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.085" offset="751679">So that has to be kept in mind in examining this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.081" offset="767666">Now, there are also are steel suppliers who are qualified by the defense department.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.175" offset="804028">And anybody that wants to come forward and qualify for these various -- the supply steel is very welcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.503" offset="841435">And they have had all kinds of procedure in regards to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.736" offset="862333">And they so certify it when they are qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.802" offset="874559">Now, many of these cases, some steel plant will come forward and say, “We'd like to qualify.”</text>
            <text syncTime="200.670" offset="906010">And it maybe as much as six -- as six or eight months before they demonstrate their ability to produce the quality of steel that the defense department contract requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.235" offset="968286">So that -- that is one of the problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.946" offset="983124">It was some of the mills that are not struck at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.051" offset="999528">Another problem is that many of those mills have got all the business and that they can handle in the form of defense contracts they're now supplying their ability to take care of defense contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.501" offset="1061386">The -- and then there -- the special items that I referred to in regard to missile and the other top priority programs that none of the mills that are struck can supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.893" offset="1110915">So, in dealing with that problem, I just wanted to demonstrate the fact that there was in effect, in accordance with public regulations, a system that was taking out of the unstruck mills everything that would contribute to the defense effort without any further order on October 16th.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.033" offset="1195551">Now, on October 16th at least say in our brief a counsel referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.862" offset="1214777">We did, the Government did through the allocation administration put out this order to take care of the mills if a settlement was reached or if the injunction or when the injunction became effective to terminate the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.168" offset="1284054">At that time, there would be a considerable problem in the whole industry of the plants that had been struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.488" offset="1321357">The problem would be whether hardly it would deal with this top priority items that had accumulated during the time of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.373" offset="1360854">And the order expressly provides that they shall have a little leeway to try to meet these requirements for defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.318" offset="1408606">Instead of having to -- prepare a batch for a particular defense item and if they have another item that's top priority too, then they close down the whole works instead of finishing that batch out and make the next one which would become so economic -- uneconomic, that the Government would have to pay tremendous prices for steel that -- within a very limited time in the ordinary course of doing business could be produced at reasonable prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.222" offset="1780276">There is a factor of replacement of plant and all of those elements that is not in that figure, as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.509" offset="1813400">That as each defense contractor has to put in new machine tools from time to time, replace his rolling -- his rollers and another things in the plants and that requires steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.848" offset="1858748">And that is not enough to figure but that would not be a large sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.859" offset="1874840">Now, the reason that the figure is not as large as a -- was before is because of the change in the whole defense program that's involved in the change from World War II to our present plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.215" offset="1936280">While it's -- it's a very substantial amount, it's more crucial in special items than ever before.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.180" offset="1968044">One example is in regard to missile program, the skin for the missile is of the special stainless steel to resist the conditions of the atmosphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.686" offset="2018095">And that has to be rolled out by some of the leading mills between two sheets of other steel in order to make this steel skin otherwise it wouldn't hold together during the rolling process.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.522" offset="2073475">That's part of the problem and then the whole research and development program is also involved in all kinds of special new items that our -- our industry is adopting as rapidly as it can but only a few had been able to qualified to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.519" offset="2141497">And it's -- you just can't accept inferior product in the process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1848.607" offset="7497749">The injunctive power is one that's come to courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.631" offset="7513945">We do not tie the injunctive provision of a lay counsel has to the other actions in the statute because we think that the Congress deliberately chose the injunction for the purpose of trying to protect the public during this 80-day interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.281" offset="7596492">They chose the 80 days or a period of, as defined in the statute in order -- they call it possible cooling off period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.562" offset="7641631">They didn't -- they hope for settlement during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.517" offset="7657409">They didn't indicate that it was going to be accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.891" offset="7682905">And they discuss the fact that whether or not there should be compulsory arbitration or some other device at the end to that period to solve the strike and Senator Taft advised directly that he was opposed to that, that he felt the Congress should examine the thing upon the report of the President in each case much as the common law and determine what should be done to solve the situation at the end of the injunctive period, if -- if the strike was not settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.901" offset="7814980">And -- so, it was not conceived that this would settle all the strikes and Senator Taft was very careful to point that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.303" offset="7864613">But he did feel when -- that the Congress could handle the matter and devise a program for each incident as occurred from time to time upon the report of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.338" offset="7920724">Now, the elements of -- for judicial action are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.794" offset="7946533">The issue is to whether or not the country is in peril by a strike that satisfies these requirements of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.240" offset="7984358">It's a factual situation that the courts do deal with in some areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.977" offset="8023228">We think it's comparable to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.547" offset="8033573">The courts regularly are asked to deal with in regard to the anti-trust laws, in regard -- determining whether is a tendency toward a trend, toward monopoly or whether there's the other elements of economic and financial control involved in some of those case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.506" offset="8129390">And that there has to be a determination as -- not only as to the present condition but what the effect may -- might be or will be in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.233" offset="8168260">And that the courts have traditionally been called upon to do that and Congress thought it was asking the court to do something that courts do traditionally and have that the form is one that the courts have been called upon, to act upon in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.029" offset="8247463">The Tubin (ph) case is one example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.474" offset="8261256">We think that the power of the Government to acquire property under statute and the authority Congress has given there is another where there is no duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.868" offset="8306813">There is certainly no duty on the part of the owner of the property, invade the property before the action is brought in condemnation proceedings and -- and the other case that we have indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.934" offset="8355088">We think the Debs case is another support for this traditional way of handling procedures in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.239" offset="8408377">And that it supports our position that there is nothing to the constitutional argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.706" offset="8474206">I'd like to say final that I think that the Congress was trying to develop a remedy in this situation that would protect the public interest that they were not trying to put their hands upon the scale and health either labor or management.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.979" offset="8583293">That it -- the construction suggested by counsel would cause it to have a very inequitable arrangement if there could be some of these plants opened and others remain closed because, presumably, either those that were close and were unable to satisfy their civilian business would lose that business or they would have to settle immediately and pay a higher price to the business in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.056" offset="8715577">And if you follow the -- that through the -- in the practical economics of business, you'd see that Congress didn't have anything like that in mind, it didn't intend to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.877" offset="8762911">It was trying to address itself to the protection of the public in this kind of situation and see that throughout the period they define which they hope would make it possible to resolve the conflict but they recognized that at the end, it will have to be accorded to the Congress and that if it wasn't determined, the Congress would have to settle it in each case for itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2260.418" offset="9145031">I would like very briefly to reply to my friend, the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.639" offset="9165928">Mr. Justice Stewart, you asked the question of where we got our 1% figure from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.217" offset="9188289">If you'll look at page 92 of the record, you will find that the source is the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization of the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.056" offset="9227577">It's less by quarters, starting first quarter of 1958, the amount of shipments of steel products for all defense purposes, it is less than 1% over the last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.421" offset="9289017">And I think that's an appendix statement of the Government's need in the defense they're at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.166" offset="9324022">Mr. Justice Black, you inquired as to legislative history on health and safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.982" offset="9359339">There is some illumination in this area that we haven't adverted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.105" offset="9383790">Senator Smith was a distinguished man or member of the Senate Labor Committee, later it became the ranking republican member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.767" offset="9418480">In the debates, in this discussing this, he said, “Furthermore, entitled to the bill, we provide for extreme cases which threaten national paralysis.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.853" offset="9462784">To me, the industry-wide stoppage of some kind which may cause injury to the health or safety of 140 million people, such as a transportation strike or a coal strike, we have set up special machinery which will unable the Attorney General on his own initiative to petition the courts to prevent either a shut down or a walkout until remediation processes have had time to function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.786" offset="9570513">That's in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.110" offset="9579813">The -- it's compiled by the board, 2 Legislative History 1145.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.016" offset="9607398">I referred earlier that I have also at page 1270, where Mr. Smith, in response to questions, makes the same essential statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.455" offset="9653164">I referred earlier to Senator Taft's statement where he dealt with the automobile situation, which is also in the legislative history and where he again says “The national health or safety or condition, which either is anticipated, will not often occur.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.178" offset="9744071">Now, there is another reason that the statute in this area ought to be construed very narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.136" offset="9771865">My friend, Mr. Solicitor General, adverted to it in passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.632" offset="9785866">I would like to emphasize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.265" offset="9796420">This statute is engrafted on the Labor Management Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.711" offset="9814183">And Section 13, protecting the right to strike, is still an important and indispensable part of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.108" offset="9847829">This is a limited exemption to the broad right to strike protected by Section 13 of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.101" offset="9895790">Statement was made in this Court about the number of plants by the Solicitor General will -- which might have to be opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.673" offset="9938108">This is the first time to get information on this subject in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.432" offset="9961096">The record doesn't contain one piece of evidence on any construction of evidence giving the best -- best credence you can to opinion evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.332" offset="10008743">But as I understand the rules, nevertheless, must be base upon fact as to this particular fact which is now given to us about the seven plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.678" offset="10058062">The record does show that over 310 steel plants of varying types of seven-dozen loom has a large number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.228" offset="10096306">And in the specific response to the question as to whether the steel can be produced by the plants now on strike, there is the conclusion to this effect by the Secretary of Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.131" offset="10159940">But there are no names, no numbers, no specification of this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.460" offset="10197243">Now, it is true that steel is not a completely a fungible commodity, it is a largely a fungible commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.982" offset="10239352">When I talked about carbon steel, that's a fungible commodity, structural steel is a fungible commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.029" offset="10275506">The type of steel that is not a fungible commodity by and large is steel alloy, steels made out of electric furnaces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.975" offset="10319287">It is not entirely true that we don't know the companies that make these in the sense that this is not a publicized fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.091" offset="10363695">The brochures of many companies openly say that we make steel of this type for the missile programs for Polaris, for Atlas, for Titan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.285" offset="10412492">I saw a couple of dozen of them in my offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.195" offset="10428165">They -- and they're -- all we have to do is pick up Time magazine this week, and we will find many companies advertising the fact that they make this steel for these high priority highly confidential events.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.273" offset="10492426">The problem we have and have confronted and confronted with throughout is that the Government does not specify in any of its affidavits what these companies are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.116" offset="10543835">So, we have had to do a job of reconstruction which we attempted to do in our brief, in this document filed with the clerk, metal selector, October 26 and in the appendix to our brief, we have tried to take the alloy steel by its composition which is described here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.983" offset="10639339">And companies are in -- in the metal selector in industry magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.028" offset="10659506">And we try to demonstrate by these published documents that the electric steel of the various types used for the defense program is made in the plans not on strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="3129.255" offset="12620361">Every steel company, not every, but of many steel companies operate under priority systems of the -- under the defense production.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.621" offset="12669889">And the non-struck companies as well as the struck companies have operated traditionally under that priority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.535" offset="12705520">And under that priority system, when the strike took place, there was an existing amount set aside for defense on the state for illustration, 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.862" offset="12766856">Now, the non-struck plants have that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.646" offset="12773961">That was there normal set-aside for defense purposes when the strike broke up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.227" offset="12800293">My complaint against the Government was that despite a great strike, despite the length of that strike, nothing was done to change that set-aside until October the 16th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.979" offset="12879287">On October the 16th, they were told by an order which is attached to the brief which we files on the District Court, which is part of the record here, we transmitted it in orders in the record, they were told that they must accept for delivery during the fourth calendar quarter of 1959, more orders even though the applicable set-aside has been reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.583" offset="13021706">So they were told that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.004" offset="13031424">What they were not told, this is the point I meant to make, was that the rest of their steel as they -- that -- and it's all specialty steel in many of these plants, should be set aside for filling other orders of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.062" offset="13111672">Of course, this is what was done in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.342" offset="13128704">All of their specialty steels were frozen so that defense requirements could be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.629" offset="13157857">That would mean that under the Defense Production Act, that steel could be sequestered for some of these manufacturers that Mr. Rankin adverted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.298" offset="13212609">Now, when my friend, the Solicitor General says that they need a lot of steel for transportation, that statistic includes automobile, and it is a great question as to whether the automobile industry is necessary or detrimental to the health of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3336.361" offset="13448861">It makes tanks, guns, armored vehicles, military trucks, jeeps, missiles and a variety of ordinance required through -- for the defense of the country.</text>
