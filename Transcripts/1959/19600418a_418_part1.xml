            <text syncTime="21.611" offset="189837">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.136" offset="207914">It's always a pleasure to be here in this spot.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.721" offset="226304">This case comes here from the Sixth Circuit by way of writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.132" offset="251904">The principal question for the decision of -- of the Court is whether or not the order of the Labor Board which was enforced by the Sixth Circuit is too broad and that it enjoined the petitioner, both petitioners from interfering with restraining the employees of any employer including of the -- of the primary employer and those of any other employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.295" offset="392547">The question is whether or not the language or any other employer is too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.112" offset="423790">The rule which was announced by this Court in 1941 in the Express Publishing Company case has stood and has been adhered to in all subsequent decisions of this Court and of the Courts of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.710" offset="490245">It's all for that rule in substance was that the order of the National Labor Relations Board and towards the decree of the Sixth Circuit, to paraphrase, must be bottomed in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.669" offset="558059">The evidence must authorize a conclusion that the unfair -- or they must authorize the Board to issue an order and that the evidence must show what unfair labor practices were committed and the order should be restricted to those unless there are other circumstances of such as a past history of misconduct of a similar type or an affirmative showing on the record that the respondent before the Labor Board intends to extend the conduct to some other employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.435" offset="733080">Otherwise, this Court has held that the scope of the Board's order must be restricted to the parties involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.862" offset="762859">It's the position of the petitioners as the -- I think the primary collateral question for decision which goes into the principal one that there was no evidence in the record, either by way of direct evidence or by way of history from which a -- a broad order could be based.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.142" offset="855960">And that the counsel for the National Labor Relations Board, when they -- and for the first time injected into the case by way of their briefs in the Sixth Circuit the fact that there had been two previous compromise settlements of other Labor Board cases in which one of the petitioners here, the Communications Workers, had been a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.826" offset="970689">Those were compromise settlements and it is our positioned if there was no evidence in the record other than those compromise settlements which should not be considered by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.504" offset="1017396">The case arises out of a strike at Ohio Consolidated Telephone Company in Portsmouth, Ohio which began in July, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.794" offset="1062536">The Communications Workers of America was the collective bargaining representative for the employees of the Ohio Consolidated Telephone Company for a period of 14 years previous to July 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.649" offset="1121991">The Communications Workers of America is a National Labor Organization operating through out the United States and also in the Dominion of Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.072" offset="1163682">It has about 730 local unions and it has contracts with over 100 different employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.604" offset="1197746">It also -- seeks to organize and to represent the employees of other employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.876" offset="1238915">The scope of the order enjoining it from interfering with or restraining the employees of the Ohio Consolidated Telephone Company in the exercise of their rights under Section 7 of the Act or the employees of any other employer would authorize an extension of the order to cover all of those 100 employers and their employees throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.718" offset="1362213">When the strike occurred in July of 1956, three local unions who administer the contract with Ohio Consolidated Telephone Company went out on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.857" offset="1418846">The petitioner here, Local 4372, it res -- is -- has jurisdiction or has as its members, those employees who reside in Portsmouth, Ohio and vicinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.869" offset="1478823">The other two local unions who were not made respondents before the Labor Board also went out on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.988" offset="1523336">During the course of the strike, Ohio Consolidated continued to operate its telephone facilities enforcement and elsewhere in Ohio by using supervisory employees who were, carried on his own payroll, his own supervisory employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.076" offset="1607659">Its confidential secretaries to management officials -- management officials and other employees possibly appeal -- grow more of -- of a clerical nature who were not represented by the Communications Workers and its local unions in their bargaining capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.937" offset="1691146">It also used in order to carry on the telephone operation during the strike supervisory employees of other affiliated telephone companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.046" offset="1739525">The record shows that Ohio Consolidated Telephone Company is one of the subsidiary companies or sister companies as referred to of the General Telephone System which is a system of telephone companies roughly comparable or not in -- so as to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company which operates of course a nationwide telephone system composed of a number of operating companies and other facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.816" offset="1874631">General Telephone Company is substantially similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.656" offset="1889991">Among its subsidiary companies are General Telephone Company of Ohio, General Telephone Company of West Virginia, General Telephone Company of Pennsylvania, General Telephone Company of the South West and I believe there's one in Illinois and Ohio Consolidated Telephone Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.894" offset="1967000">During the period of the strike, supervisory employees from these various sister operating companies were loaned to Ohio Consolidated Telephone Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.116" offset="2027813">During the period of the strike, they worked side by side with the Ohio Consolidated's own supervisory employees and were under the direction and control of Ohio Consolidated Management.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.449" offset="2097194">They did not take any orders or did not receive their orders from the -- their primary employers, the other companies of the general system who carried them on their payroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.557" offset="2153618">They -- the record shows that they were paid for this work by their primary employer, all of the primary employer did direct the performance of the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.968" offset="2215267">However, the primary employer with various other operating companies of the general system build Ohio Consolidated for the salaries of their supervisory employees for the work which was performed during the strikes and Ohio Consolidated retained its sister companies for the work performed so that substantially, they will -- the -- borrow the employees were carried on Ohio Consolidated's payroll for all practical purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.768" offset="2366464">It's the contention of the Labor Board as I understand it that the fact that these supervisory employees were the regular employees of some other employers, justifies the extension of the order to cover other employers than those or the employees of other employers than the (Voice Overlap) primary employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="691.033" offset="2867493">There were a number of instances of -- of threats and -- and some actual violence on the part of the members and officers of -- of the petitioner, Local 4372.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.660" offset="2917961">There was no act of violence shown in the record of intended or alleged by either of the other two local unions who were on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.112" offset="2955786">Only the members and officers of that one local union engaged in any acts of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.890" offset="2982954">All of the acts of violence which are shown in the record with one exception were directed towards the supervisory employees of Ohio Consolidated and the -- those of the sister companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.805" offset="3058604">There was one exception, and Ms. Maynard who was a confidential secretary to the vice president of the telephone company was interfered with in going into an exchange on one occasion and she said she didn't want to work anyway and -- and left and came back and went to work later.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.705" offset="3138226">But there was a lot of publicity, Mr. Justice Harlan, in answer to your question concerning these various acts of violence which were directly towards supervisory employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.590" offset="3201755">The -- the Labor Board contended that because employ -- as I construe their contention that because employees of other employers disassociated from the labor dispute may have heard through the radio, the newspaper, of the fact that there was violence at Ohio Consolidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.865" offset="3290781">They were put on the notice that the employees were -- would engage in an act to violence to prevent somebody from working during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.595" offset="3329755">Now, that I hadn't given much consideration to as been a substantial argument at all because these people, members of the public in general were not in the relationship of employer and employee or labor union to employee of the disputants.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.649" offset="3413974">And in that -- all I can say to that is if the Labor Board can -- can restrain, issue a broad -- broad order on that basis, it -- it means that Congress has given to the Labor Board that primary function of controlling violence in -- in general.</text>

            <text syncTime="1763.156" offset="7155963">These coercive tactics included not only violence -- not only threats of violence but also actual violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.949" offset="7183130">On various occasions, union agents followed the company personnel to their homes in an effort to intimidate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.656" offset="7213955">They also prevented access as well invest and egress to and from the company premises to employed company personnel who were seeking to perform services and also to make deliveries.</text>
