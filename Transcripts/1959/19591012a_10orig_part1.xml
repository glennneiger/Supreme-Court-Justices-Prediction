            <text syncTime="19.146" offset="179911">The orders of the Court are hereupon the list certified by the Chief Justice to be filed with the clerk.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="42.105" offset="271757">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.424" offset="293073">This case involved the issue of whether the United States is entitled to the lands, minerals and other things under the sea within the distance beyond three miles seaward of the low watermark or the limit of inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.820" offset="398608">This Court by its decisions in the cases of United States against California, United States against Texas and United States against Louisiana determined that all of the lands, minerals and other things under sea from the low watermark and the outer limit of inland waters, belong to the United States or at least that the United States had paramount rights and power over such properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.229" offset="528280">So that without further action, there'll be no question here, but what all of that land or those lands, properties, minerals and so forth, belong to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.016" offset="583450">The question then before the Court is what kind of a relinquishment the United States may, to give to the States some rights in such properties and the extent of that relinquishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.102" offset="647816">The only relinquishment that the Court needs to deal with at this time is that made by the Submerged Lands Act of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.891" offset="686895">And what were the intents and purposes of the Congress in the passing of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.243" offset="752306">The Act is set out on pages 31 through 34 of the Government's brief, insofar as the crucial parts of it are concerned, that the Court needs to turn its attention to during this deliberation and argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.295" offset="844570">The grant was made by Section 3 that appears at the bottom of page 31.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.230" offset="892322">And it defines the nature of the grant titled to and ownerships of -- of the lands, beneath navigable waters within the boundaries of the respective States and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.278" offset="944462">And the right and power to administer such land and properties and the United States hereby releases and relinquishes onto the States such properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.668" offset="990020">Then you have to turn to Section 2 to determine the definition of what lands beneath navigable waters are defined to be under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.836" offset="1042683">And that recites where, in any case, the boundary line of each such State or in any case, such boundary as it existed at the time such State became a member of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.108" offset="1103809">Now, that will become during this argument, a crucial language that the Court will have to determine the meaning of and if it is not entirely clear from the language itself what the Congress intend, which can be drawn from the congressional debates and the other actions by the Congress before the passage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.462" offset="1197223">It also goes on indeed to say, includes the seaward boundaries of a State or its boundaries in the Gulf of Mexico or any of the great lakes as they existed at the time such State became a member of the Union or as heretofore approved by the Congress or as extended or confirmed pursuant to Section 4 hereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.185" offset="1288129">Some of the issues involved will be what -- when at the time the State became a member of the Union means.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.543" offset="1321566">Whether it meant the time that the State became one of the number of the States of the United States, whether it meant just prior to that time, the claim is made that that language is open to the construction that meant prior to the time it became a member of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.092" offset="1407770">Or whether it is that exact moment when the State enters upon its respective rights, duties and limitations as a member of the Union or the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.697" offset="1466180">Then there are some questions that will be dealt with during the argument in regard to Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.008" offset="1499408">Section 4 was intended and says in so many words that it -- purpose is to give to the States that do not have a three-mile boundary, the right to extend their boundaries out to three miles and confirms those boundaries expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.701" offset="1590209">And then leaves open, the Government of the United States contends, the question of whether or not, they got the beyond three miles as to whether the States of the Gulf and that -- those were the only States that are allowed the opportunity to establish that they had a boundary at the time they became a member of the Union, beyond three miles up to three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.318" offset="1712671">The law is very clear that they limited the grant, so that it could not in any case, be beyond three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.039" offset="1751542">But they are given the opportunity, the -- the United States contends.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.437" offset="1801070">We think that it's clearly recognized in the briefs in this litigation now, that the Act does not permit anything beyond the three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.258" offset="1848404">The provisions of Section 4 do preserve, the United States concedes or agrees the right for them to claim for other purposes that they at the time they became a member of the Union, did have a boundary beyond then -- the three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.381" offset="1932936">But under the Act, it is recognized by the briefs of the parties that no claim can be validated or found to be valid by this Court beyond three leagues, because it expressly limits it to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.071" offset="1995630">Now, during the debates there was --</text>

            <text syncTime="476.310" offset="2008586">The reason for my question was -- my recollection to the original argument in this case where Louisiana was the sole party was that were was a claim made to be extended beyond three leagues up to the Continental Shelf, that claim has been abandoned?</text>

            <text syncTime="500.990" offset="2107329">There is still a contention by Louisiana that it did have rights or did have boundary claims --</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="526.738" offset="2210356">On page 34, there is a language that nothing in this section is to be construed and that's in Section 4, page 34, at the top of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.324" offset="2260720">“As questioning or in any manner prejudicing the existence of any State's seaward boundary beyond three geographical miles, if it was so provided by its constitution or laws prior to or at the time such State became a member of the Union, or if it has been heretofore approved by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.576" offset="2341700">The United States takes the position that that is a no-prejudice sentence in Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.258" offset="2376391">And was expressly put into the statute, so that there would be nothing, no construction, conclusions or interpretation drawn from this particular Submerged Lands Act Law that would prejudice, that would go against any State as to its claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.455" offset="2465207">But the United States also contends, which is contrary to the State's contention and I want to call it your attention as we develop it in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.207" offset="2500211">That there was no purpose to create affirmative rights by that provision that it didn't declare, affirm or confirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.222" offset="2552247">Now, the first part of Section 4 does confirm such boundary claims up to three miles that have been made prior to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.324" offset="2596655">And that was the scheme of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.214" offset="2608253">That all of the States that would have a maritime boundary, would have such boundaries perfected and confirmed either if they had them already or if they further -- if they later extended them to three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.893" offset="2670947">And then the question came as to what about the three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.866" offset="2690800">And the Congress carefully provided that this Act was not to prejudice such claims either for the purposes of this litigation or any contentions under this statute or any other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.476" offset="2745240">But it didn't confirm -- give any validity or make valid any such claims beyond three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.213" offset="2780244">Now the contention of the States just stated and we'll develop in the argument, is that this -- the purpose of this was to validate such claims to three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.978" offset="2827264">And that by reading this particular provision about no-prejudice, they tried to take the words, “prior to,” or at the time such State became a member of the Union, in that particular sentence and read them back into the other section of Section 2, so as to put, “prior to” in Section 2 where it very clearly says, “Not prior to at all, but at the time it became a member of the Union”.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.311" offset="2960593">And the Government of the United States contends that Congress did this carefully and deliberately trying to relate itself in the no-prejudice, where they could claim this extended boundary for many other purposes in regard to their State activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.197" offset="3036139">But as far as this law was concerned, they said, “If you want to come within this law and get three leagues or three miles, you must comply with this provision.”</text>
            <text syncTime="752.433" offset="3113148">The three miles was -- confirms, so we don't have to bother about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.240" offset="3132374">But beyond three miles, you have to show that at that time you became a member of the Union, you had a boundary beyond three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.736" offset="3198307">And then you can get, if you can prove it, what you can prove between three miles and three leagues and no more.</text>

            <text syncTime="800.045" offset="3303528">-- by reason of -- because at them moment I think we can deal with it for a moment in our thinking by taking the States of Alaska and Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.582" offset="3349713">Now, in the instance of Alaska, Congress wanted to deal with the question of certain properties, prior to the time it became admitted in the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.111" offset="3399868">And it said so, “Certain governmental installations and other properties of that kind.”</text>
            <text syncTime="829.723" offset="3422229">And it expressly provided that, “prior to” was the measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.158" offset="3439992">And it said that that kind of control of the United States over those properties, that it had, prior to, should continue after the new State very carefully done showing Congress knows how to do those things exactly the way it wants to.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.601" offset="3573739">But they did it precisely, deal with that question of “prior to”.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.186" offset="3592129">Now, here they say with -- explicitly in Section 2, “At the time they became a member of the Union and on the non-prejudice, they deal with the words, prior to, in addition showing their ability to distinguish in treating the two matters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="891.536" offset="3669556">But in dealing with the question of, at the time, in trying to answer Mr. Justice Black's question, at the time it became a member of the Union, there are all kinds of legal incidents that proceed out of that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.852" offset="3734758">And this Court has passed in various times in the past upon the rights of individuals, of States and of the United States, proceeding out of that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.634" offset="3789928">The moment before it became a member of the Union, Texas for instance, which was an independent country, the others were territories before they became members of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.033" offset="3843532">It had the power to regulate its own foreign affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.357" offset="3864848">The moment it became a member of the Union, it lost that power and it recognized it.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.314" offset="3888671">In correspondence with the British Foreign Office, Texas said when they were asked, “What is going to happen to our treaties when you become annexed to the United States, the treaties that the Republic of Texas had with -- with the -- the British?”</text>
            <text syncTime="966.865" offset="3970800">And they responded and said, “Of course, we'll live up to our treaties, just as we always have in the past, up to the time we've become annexed to the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="979.455" offset="4021164">And from that time on, you will have to address yourself to the United States, because it will have charge of our foreign affairs from that date on.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.375" offset="4064841">Now in addition to that, citizens of the Republic of Texas had certain rights under the laws of that republic, certain provisions of their constitution and statutes that they're entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.870" offset="4130879">They had no rights to protection or to privileges or benefits as citizens of the United States, until they became a member of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.913" offset="4183019">At that moment, they lost their position with whatever privileges and limitations they had as citizens of Texas and they became automatically citizens of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.383" offset="4244877">Now, that this Republic of Texas as an independent country, had all kinds of rights that they had, by reason of annexation and they had certain limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.046" offset="4295555">They recognized one as to their foreign affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.622" offset="4309870">They couldn't conduct their foreign affairs for one second after that moment when they became a member of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.804" offset="4346546">They couldn't call upon the United States to defend them against Mexico, against the British or any other -- of the family of nations.</text>

            <text syncTime="5811.165" offset="23348015">For instance, with -- with Russia when they asserted the right to inspect vessels out 12 miles was really related to smuggling or at least that's what they claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5824.197" offset="23400155">We did protest against it, saying they were limited to three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="5828.090" offset="23415724">They wound up claiming the whole 12 miles as general jurisdiction and a right and then apparently our Government thought that might be the outcome if we didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="5838.207" offset="23456162">So that -- and then we had an assertion by Mexico of 20 kilometers at one time and we protested that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5846.881" offset="23490853">And then they said, “Well, that same thing you're doing four leagues.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5851.916" offset="23511019">And he said, “Well, we don't do it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5853.725" offset="23518229">We only inspect vessels that are coming to our ports and it's a matter of convenience.”</text>
