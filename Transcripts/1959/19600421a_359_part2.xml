          <heading>Argument of Joseph A. Maun</heading>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="5.319">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">You may proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.926" offset="123068">Mr. --</text>

          <turn speaker="joseph_a_maun" startTime="5.319" stopTime="294.371">
            <label>Mr. Joseph A. Maun</label>
            <text syncTime="5.319" offset="124635">Mr. Chief Justice, the opinion of the Eighth Circuit in this case adopted the same view that the Government has pressed and that is that the -- what Government did in this case was merely take over control in regulation of these carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.611" offset="193808">In the Eighth Circuit opinion, it states, “It -- it took limit to possession in control of petitioner's transportation system and other property used therewith.”</text>
            <text syncTime="31.669" offset="230066">But it specifically left titles to the properties and in the other assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.983" offset="247306">Now, that is the very same argument made in the Mine Workers case and I'll just quote to you just a statement made -- made by Justice Black in that case and he said that, “The fact that it -- it, talking about the Government, utilized the managerial forces of the private owners does not detract from the Government's complete authority for whatever control, the Government agents delegated to the private managers, so as the agents have full power to take away and exercise themselves.”</text>
            <text syncTime="63.537" offset="357543">Now, perhaps the Eighth Circuit was misled.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.384" offset="364857">I argued the case there and in the Fifth Circuit and I would concede that I did not brief it as well in the Eight Circuit as I did what I got to the Fifth.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.390" offset="396936">The argument had made -- has been made time and time again that this, an involuntary conversion provision, the 117 (j), cannot apply because title or it wasn't taken, all he had was use.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.853" offset="450748">Well, this Court has recognized in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.807" offset="462555">That are two ways in which a Government can proceed when it takes property under it's -- even their main authorities, in the (Inaudible) cases, these cases were -- was rules are set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.131" offset="507904">One way, the Government can enter into -- and take property by seizure as it did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.523" offset="529429">And this is typically a case of seizure as pointed out by Justice Frankfurter in the Youngstown case where he specifically states that Midwest takeover cases -- this typical case of seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.206" offset="572165">The other way is that the Government can follow ordinary court procedures, go in and take a declaration and have a declaration of title made through that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.257" offset="604348">On the latter situation, of course then, there is a sale or exchange title passes.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.591" offset="625768">But in either case, the Government has taken power, a property under its eminent domain authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.742" offset="654294">Now, there was a time as government counsel pointed out that there had to be a sale or exchange in order for the involuntary conversion provisions of 117 to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.072" offset="703613">This Court in the (Inaudible) case held that proceeds derived from insurance policies, as result of fire, were not entitled the capital gain treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.487" offset="745305">Well, as a result of that decision, Congress amended the law and at that time we were in the brink of going into World War II and there were hearings in Congress on what was happening to private property as a result of war time seizures and requisitions?</text>
            <text syncTime="175.089" offset="803715">And our brief contains a considerable amount of materials relative to those hearings, but the fact is Congress is cognizant of the fact there would be seizures and there would be requisition as a result of World War II and it was right at that time that at 117 (j) was adopted as amendment to 117 generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.748" offset="886366">Now, Congress specifically established the Motor Carriers Claims Commission for two purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.712" offset="910190">One purpose was to determine if there was a taking of properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.193" offset="924191">And the other purpose was to determine if properties were so taken, what should be the amount of the award?</text>
            <text syncTime="211.783" offset="950523">Now, the Commission specifically set up for this purpose heard these cases and it came to the conclusion that property was taken and that award under the Fifth Amendment should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.330" offset="992737">Now, we believe that the cases hold that you shouldn't look to the nature of reward as made by the Commission set up for that purpose in order to determine what the tax consequences are.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.947" offset="1043205">We do not say that the Motor Carriers Commission's determination in (Inaudible) do -- can determine the tax consequences, but we do say you must look to that award to find out whether it was something received because of the conversion of property by the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.448" offset="1113213">And that authority did so determine that.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.543" offset="1129514">Now, on the (Inaudible) case in the Second Circuit where there was a recovery for antitrust damages, capital gain treatment was accorded, are results of a goodwill being destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.266" offset="1176430">Now, the Court didn't say that the antitrust suit settlement, itself, determined capital gain treatment should be accorded, but it did say that the decision in the lower court which hadn't set up to make that determination did determine the nature of the judgment or the nature of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.263" offset="1244453">And in this case, the Motor Carriers Commission has determined that this award was for property values transferred from this petitioner to the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.987" offset="1395336">Well, as I understand in the Fifth Amendment, compensation can only be made as the result of the taking of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.484" offset="1429295">Now, if there's a contractual arrangement, either it could never be a suit under -- under the Fifth Amendment for just compensation.</text>
