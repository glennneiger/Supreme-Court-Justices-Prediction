            <text syncTime="39.659" offset="262040">If Mr. Justice Brennan and Court will indulge me, I would like to make a brief background statement with regard to these additional facts which I think ultimately will show that this identical conduct of appellants, the identical acts of appellants which I held to be a crime in this case have been held by the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina to represent their constitutional rights and that the acts of State's agents which the State has held to be lawful where an unlawful denial of these constitutional rights under the Federal Constitutions solely on the grounds of race and color.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.864" offset="474781">Now while the appellate process was running its course in connection with the first set of warrants toward the first opinion of the State Supreme Court in this case to which Mr. Justice Stewart referred yesterday, these appellants as plaintiffs have sued in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina against State's agencies, City of Greensboro, Greensboro City Board of Education who held title of the land and Gillespie Park Gold Club, Inc. which was operating it and with -- about which they have no question of -- they've also became agents of the State.</text>

Hayes in response to request for two types of relief which the appellant's plaintiffs here asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.691" offset="810088">First was a declaration of the rights of the parties concerning these identical conduct here, these are identical acts of playing golf on this golf course and the right of appellants so to play and also the rights of the parties with reference to the conduct of the State's agencies in interfering with that right.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.989" offset="1011336">Upon the trial of issues, the appellants prevailed and a declaratory judgment was issued declaring number one but this -- these identical acts represented the constitutional rights of appellants and second that the acts of the defendant's agent says interfering with that right to play was unlawful under the Constitution of the United States and that it was done solely on the grounds of race and color.</text>

            <text syncTime="2242.182" offset="9072097">It's the same practice that all lawyers have to follow and it's the same thing that's been followed all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.544" offset="9101563">The same thing is true about their questions -- they had some question over there if the -- beginning when he was raising this part about closing mouths of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.846" offset="9146807">(Inaudible) those were our witnesses that they were cross examining and the prosecutor simply objected to evidence of -- he tried this case like any other trespass case this record shows it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2283.382" offset="9236877">At that time, they had never told the Court that now we wish to make a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.462" offset="9257253">They had filed a motion to quash.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.012" offset="9263417">I'm not overlooking that but the motion to quash is relying upon the efficacy of this declaratory judgment obtained in the Federal District Court and they rely on that as an estoppel among other things and of course an attempt to raise a question on form of jeopardy and various things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.207" offset="9352234">But in the motion to quash, I -- I there have set forth in my brief case after case to show Your Honors that the motion to quash is not the way to raise a question and that pertains that matters that appear on the face of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2404.196" offset="9720142">Greensboro and the City Administrative unit which is an educational unit leased the land to Gillespie Park Golf Course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.038" offset="9759535">Now, it wasn't as bogus lease, a straw lease or a fictitious lease I say for this reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="2438.226" offset="9856293">I have in my set forth in my brief a list of things that these gentlemen are now raising for the first time and were not presented to my courts, who you're now passing upon, one of them was the sufficiency or the adequacy of the rules where they too nebulous and too broad and did they contain too much arbitrary discretion?</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.110" offset="9943855">They haven't raised that question, the trial judge didn't pass on that, the Supreme Court of North Carolina didn't pass on such questions as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.217" offset="9972276">Now, they had a rule that people could play that were belonged to golf clubs affiliated with the Carolina Golf Association and as to the rules themselves as stated in the bylaws, there is -- I can consider some ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.016" offset="10055450">I don't see them right now but when you look at them, there is some ambiguity and it -- here in the Article I, membership in this corporation should be restricted to members or approval to Board of Directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.498" offset="10105396">For membership in the club, there should be two types of membership and that was the $60 plus taxes and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.325" offset="10136639">And then, they said the golf course and its facilities should be used only by members and invited guests, members in good standing of other golf clubs, members of the Carolina Golf Association and people -- or the professional and his invited guest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.975" offset="10195257">There's an ambiguity there as to whether that golf clubs who affiliate with the Carolina Golf Association or whether it's a person who is a member in good standing in the golf club can -- would also be entitled to play in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.381" offset="10248861">In either case, it makes no difference in this case because these gentlemen, three of them who weighed something around 100 pounds had decided to got down there and play golf and -- they didn't go down there and say, “Now – here is a letter showing that we're in a good standing with the Nocho Golf Club” which one of them says they belonged to, only one of the defendants testified, they presented no letter to the pro or anybody else like that, saying “We are members in good standing of this golf club.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.677" offset="10374040">They just came down -- 75 cents down pushed in and said “we're going to play golf” and they were prosecuted for trespass which Judge Hayes said it was a -- he seems to think in his opinion according to the federal supplement that it was a matter of discrimination.</text>
