            <text syncTime="23.975" offset="199241">This is a seaman's case and it comes here on a certiorari from the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.951" offset="243127">The facts of the case are this, substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.329" offset="268727">Mr. Mitchell, the petitioner, as a seaman and a fisherman and a member of the crew of a fishing vessel, Racer, which is a fishing trawler out of Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.280" offset="332466">In April 1957, he was a member of her crew and at that time, she came back to Boston after having made a 10-day fishing trip to the fishing grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.966" offset="379277">In accordance with the usual practice, the catch was then to be unloaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.048" offset="411564">During the spawning season, there is both spawn and fish to be unloaded and in accordance with the custom, the spawn is unloaded first.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.615" offset="457853">On that day, the spawn was unloaded by the deckhands and in the unloading of the spawn, Mr. Mitchell, the petitioner, worked in the hold of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.822" offset="510621">When the spawn was unloaded and in accordance with custom, the dock and the deck and the rail are customarily washed down and those of the crew who wish to go home, then do so and the balance of the catch is taken out by those of the crew who wish to work and other persons who are hired to do the job, people known as “lumpers”.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.035" offset="627545">On that particular day when Mr. Mitchell, the petitioner, finished his work in the hold, he came up on deck and then proceeded to the (Inaudible) where he change his clothes, his working clothes, changing into his shore clothes, came back up on deck, intending to go ashore.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.406" offset="729004">And in further accordance with custom, he stepped up from the deck onto to the rail of the vessel which was alongside the wharf, intending from there to grasp a ladder which is attached to the side of the wharf and in that manner, to make his way ashore.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.063" offset="799640">When the petitioner stepped onto the rail of this vessel and was reaching for the ladder, he slipped in some, what he described as slime and gurry.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.763" offset="958464">And to keep himself from falling between the vessel and the dock into the water, he thrust his arm through a rung of the ladder and he hanged there for a brief period until he was able to work his back -- way back to safety aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.876" offset="1058879">When he hanged there by his arm, he suffered serious permanent injury to his arm.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.694" offset="1086151">This case was tried in the District Court of Massachusetts and there were three counts.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.994" offset="1155323">The jury returned the verdict for the defendant on the first two counts and for the plaintiff on the third count and it was in charging the jury, that the judge stated what the petitioner considers to have been the error in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.029" offset="1223450">He stated that notice was not -- notice was -- he stated that notice was necessary with respect to both the unseaworthiness and the negligence counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.208" offset="1280188">He stated that the -- he made no distinction between the charge with respect to negligence and unseaworthiness and charge that in order to recover on either count, the petitioner had to show that the slime was on the rail for a period of time long enough for the respondent to have known about it and to have the opportunity to remove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.027" offset="1391470">Counsel for the petitioner made an oral request that the Court distinguish in his charge between negligence and unseaworthiness and in particular requested the Court to instruct the jury that insofar as the unseaworthiness count was concerned, notice was not a necessary element.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.451" offset="1457194">The trial judge denied the request.</text>

            <text syncTime="4581.932" offset="18431143">The only requirement, I believe it shows on the evidence in the record, was that they so stole the spawn that it could be unloaded first so as not to impede the unloading of the catch of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.256" offset="18484433">The -- the record further shows in the evidence that the mate nor the captain assigned any jobs nor have the authority even the same -- assign the jobs to these 12 crew members amongst themselves in unloading the spawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="4608.585" offset="18537723">One of them voluntarily went on deck, one voluntarily went on the hull, one went up (Inaudible) to catch the baskets as they were swung ashore.</text>

            <text syncTime="4634.434" offset="18641063">The money and the accounting did not go through the owner's books at all but was sold on the fish exchange by one of the crew members for the 12 members.</text>
