            <text syncTime="25.519" offset="205406">The question before the Court in these consolidated cases is the right of three Indian fishing communities in Alaska to maintain fish traps where the Federal Government has specifically authorized them to maintain these traps and where the State has made it a crime for them to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.763" offset="294431">It is this conflict between state and federal jurisdiction, between the assertions of state and federal jurisdiction, which is the common question to the two dockets.</text>

            <text syncTime="65.704" offset="366216">The two dockets differ on a question of the origin of Indian rights here asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.039" offset="387532">And it will be my purpose to address myself first to the common questions and then to the specific question in Docket 326.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.149" offset="431940">As far as the general background is concerned, all three communities as I've indicated are fishing communities, their whole economy resting on fishing and canning.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.781" offset="490454">A key element in this economic setup of these communities are -- is a maintenance fish traps.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.975" offset="531310">Fish traps constitute an efficient way of catching salmon which has proved inexpensive or less expensive in the long run in maintaining of boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.472" offset="589302">The right for that -- of Metlakatla to maintain fish traps has been authorized by the Secretary of the Interior, for many years and most specifically, was authorized in 1959 and proposed regulations have been issued for the fishing season of 1960, which is about to start authorizing them once again to maintain these traps.</text>

            <text syncTime="3632.635" offset="14633880">The United States appears in this proceeding as amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.721" offset="14654255">It appears in support of the position of appellants.</text>

            <text syncTime="3646.680" offset="14690095">I would like at the outset of this argument to comment briefly on the jurisdictional question that this Court reserved in its order of December 7th, setting this case for argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.328" offset="14744639">I would agree with Mr. Schifter, that the brief most recently filed by the State of Alaska has rather much resolved all the questions that may have existed in December.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.759" offset="14790405">I would, however, like to put the position of the Government on this jurisdictional point, because the Government is satisfied that in this case, the United States Supreme Court does have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.101" offset="14851741">The brief for Alaska, adopting the position that the United States took last July, when it was asked to comment upon this case, concedes that under the Statehood Act and under the existing laws of Alaska, the court below was created as a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.077" offset="14927705">Moreover, that the court below was the highest court of the State of Alaska, the time of judgment below was entered, at the time the, restraining order was requested and granted by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3942.420" offset="15873024">Position -- this position is borne out both by the language of the statute and by its legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3950.191" offset="15904162">Now, the precise terms of Section 4 from which the Government relies and they are set forth in our brief at page 13 are these, they're very short.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.292" offset="15940524">“Lands or other property including fishing rights, the right or title to which maybe held by said natives or is held by the United States in trust for said natives, shall be and remain under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the United States until disposed of under its authority.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.778" offset="16026520">There's the statutory language upon which we relied to give us absolute jurisdiction and control over Indian fishing rights in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.614" offset="16065808">Now, it is the position of the United States that the phrase, “fishing rights,” of which Section 4 speaks, are not true property rights, legal rights, proprietary interest, the taking of which would create a duty of compensation under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.295" offset="16140518">Rather, we use rights and rights were used in that statute for our intention, in a broader sense, in the sense of fishing privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.407" offset="16180955">Now, in this very area, its not -- it's not uncommon to speak of nonproprietary interests as rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.261" offset="16216377">I might point out that this Court in the Tee-Hit-Ton case, a case decided just before -- shortly before the language in here was affirmed up as -- as to be permanently in the Statehood Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4046.220" offset="16288266">This Court had the occasion to say in Tee-Hit-Ton, speaking of Indian title which is a -- a privilege based on aboriginal use and possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.319" offset="16332675">This is not a property right, but amounts to a right of occupancy which the sovereign grants and protects against intrusion by third parties of which right of occupancy maybe terminated in such lands fully disposed of by the sovereign itself without any legally enforceable obligations to compensate the Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.053" offset="16423581">Tee-Hit-Ton is a case, when you read the legislative history of a Statehood Act that was right in the forefront of the minds of the legislators.</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.128" offset="16455868">They knew when they spoke of rights in Alaska, in Indians, that they weren't talking about compensable rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.728" offset="16494320">Now, as I have said, our construction phrase, “fishing rights,” accords with congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.520" offset="16521488">Let me comment for a moment on some of that legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.707" offset="16538206">The phrase including fishing rights was put in to Alaska Statehood Act in the Senate, in the 81st Congress and the report of the committee that framed this -- of this section, reads as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.033" offset="16603512">I'm speaking of the bill that it provides, “For transfer to the State of highly important Alaskan fisheries and wildlife, except those which are subject to international agreement or are included within the reserved native rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.682" offset="16690134">In the 84th Congress, the Congress before the Alaska Statehood Act was enacted, the House report on the bill, the same language had survived through the 81st and on into the 84th Congress, had this to say, “It is provided that no attempt will be made to deal with the legal merits of the indigenous rights, but to leave the matter in status quo for either further legislative action or judicial determination.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.892" offset="16798908">Those very words were picked up in the House report in the 85th Congress, the Congress that enacted the Alaska Statehood Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.907" offset="16830986">The substance of those words were picked up in the report of the Senate Committee in the 85th Congress that voted out the Alaska Statehood.</text>

            <text syncTime="5397.766" offset="21694464">Alaska was one of the few territories which were discriminated against in the control of its fishing game as a territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5404.768" offset="21722467">The Organic Act of 1912 prohibited the territorial legislature from enacting any legislation whatsoever concerning the fisheries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.782" offset="21762487">Consequently, Alaska never challenged anything that the Federal Government did as a territory because it was expressly withheld from us into the plenary power of the United States to provide for the Government of its territories and possessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5429.723" offset="21822255">In Alaska, the salmon industry, the commercial salmon industry and we're not talking about subsistence here and there's a great difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5437.209" offset="21852244">The commercial salmon industry, according to our Appendix 2, in Southeastern Alaska, and that is the pan handle, what we call the pan handle, the little strip of land which comes down along the coast of Canada, landlocked Canada actually in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5455.017" offset="21923401">85.9% of the natural resource products of the region are the commercial fishery, 89 -- 85.9.</text>
            <text syncTime="5468.104" offset="21975751">The commercial fishery, under the Federal Government, it's probably one of the wealthiest, most fantastic fisheries in the world fell from a peak productivity in 1918 of seven million cases to less than two million cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5487.607" offset="22053804">The fishery is practically destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5492.309" offset="22072613">There is enough seed left to rebuild it and the people that live in Alaska, regardless of how it happened in their federal management that this fishery was practically destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5504.137" offset="22119946">The facts are -- the statistics are that that is what has happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="5628.729" offset="22618258">We need not to argue it too much, but we can make the same observation that the Solicitor General did in the case of the United States versus Winans, concerning the fish wheels on the Columbia River and that is this, that they take tons of fish that not only is the device depleting the industry, the resource, but threatens to destroy it.</text>
