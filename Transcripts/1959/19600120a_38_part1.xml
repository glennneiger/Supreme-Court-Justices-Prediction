            <text syncTime="22.388" offset="192972">This case comes to this Court by a writ of certiorari from a decision of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals which was handed down on August 29th, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.476" offset="241246">The opinion was written by Judge Cameron and Judge Reeves dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.886" offset="258905">Rehearing was denied on September 29th of -- 1958, certiorari was filed on October 24th of 1958, and this Court granted certiorari on March 2nd, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.177" offset="316061">It also granted petitioners leave to proceed in forma pauperis and I was appointed as counsel for the petitioner by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.904" offset="350960">In -- on June 6 of 1959, petitioner finished serving his sentence in the Huntsville Penitentiary with time off for good behavior.</text>

            <text syncTime="74.663" offset="402056">That was three months after certiorari was granted and at that time, he was dismissed from the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.809" offset="430582">I informed the Court of this dismissal and suggested that there might be continuing legal effects of this conviction of his and that if the Court wished me to argue the possible applicability of the Pollard case, I would be happy to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.088" offset="491708">The Court has informed counsel through its clerk to add mootness to the issues to be argued in the brief and in the oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.113" offset="523786">As in the briefs, I'd like to turn first to the question of denial of due process because I believe that this may effect in some way because -- which the Court may want to take in its discretion on the question of possible mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.649" offset="585958">The question of course is as Your Honors are aware, the denial of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, by denial to this petitioner and the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.631" offset="637889">The colloquy in which this occurred is set forth in the brief for petitioner on pages seven and eight.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.535" offset="673520">The Court called him for trial, asked if he was ready for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.093" offset="687731">He replied yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.014" offset="691388">The court says, “Do you want a trial by jury or without a jury?”</text>
            <text syncTime="150.617" offset="705808">Parker says, “Well -- and it's immaterial to me judge, I don't have any attorney.”</text>
            <text syncTime="154.831" offset="722735">The Court, “Well, you're going to have to make up your mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.968" offset="731199">It is certainly immaterial to the Court?”</text>
            <text syncTime="159.917" offset="743006">Parker says, “I guess a jury then.”</text>
            <text syncTime="162.702" offset="754186">“Do you have a lawyer hired?”</text>
            <text syncTime="163.834" offset="758680">“No, I don't.”</text>
            <text syncTime="165.317" offset="764635">The Court then advised the petitioner that the law does not require the Court to appoint an attorney to represent a defendant and a -- when -- where he has a trial by jury and it's not the practice of this Court to appoint any.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.936" offset="819075">It's up to him to arrange for his own counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.679" offset="830046">If he wanted a suspended sentence, they would arrange perhaps for him to have counsel as to that particular question but not as to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.021" offset="863483">And Mr. Parker said, “Well, he didn't have a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.332" offset="876648">Alright, he's ready for trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="196.700" offset="890128">It is the position of petitioner that under the long established line of cases of this Court in the cases such as Johnson versus Zerbst in 304 U.S. and in Uveges versus Pennsylvania in 335 U.S. that this was certainly not a knowing denial of the right to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.227" offset="1428250">I don't mean that the Court really should if in this case, but there is a distinct absence of any question by the Court as to whether or not he could afford counsel as to whether he hadn't taken any steps to obtain counsel or could do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.786" offset="1606510">It's still on the statute books, but fortunately, as I mentioned later in this brief, there has -- since the grant of certiorari in this case, an amendment to the Texas statute authorizing right to counsel in any felony case by anyone so accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.028" offset="1683519">So that the provision for suspended sentence now, I suppose is a dead letter which will not be impealled -- appealed but fortunately will no longer may need it.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.850" offset="1742764">Requiring it under the circumstances set out in the statute, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.394" offset="1756975">This appears in my brief on page five where the amendment is -- the amendment is set forth that when it is made known to the Court at an arraignment or any other time that an accused charged with a felony is too poor to employ a counsel, the Court shall appoint one or more practicing attorneys to defend him, who will have ten days to prepare for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.146" offset="1860002">And it then goes on to say that in the bill, enacting this amendment that the fact that the previous article applied to capital cases and does not apply to ordinary felonies, creates an emergency and an imperative public necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.531" offset="1913501">That means that it must go immediately into effect upon its signature by the governor and this amendment is now in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.615" offset="1949863">As the trial progressed, it became perfectly clear and I think it will become clear to anyone who -- who reads this record that this petitioner was way beyond his debt, impossibly helping to cope with the intricate complex legal problems that were presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.014" offset="2031470">The very indictment refers only to a forgery by him of the signature of -- Elsie Quattlebaum wherein fact it was a forged check drawn on Phoebe Quattlebaum by Elsie Quattlebaum.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.027" offset="2095522">In this connection, it should be noted as Judge Reeves noted in his dissenting opinion that the Quattlebaums were partners-in-laws and that Elsie Parker -- Elsie Quattlebaum had been an enemy of his for years and it's set forth in an affidavit later coming in the habeas corpus proceedings and this fact was never made known to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.097" offset="2171800">Now, and of course as -- as -- and be assured that Parker could have made this known if he'd had any idea of its significance, but he did not and it seems that it's the kind of a thing that a counsel certainly would have made known and would have tried to inquire further to find out just what was really involved in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.279" offset="2468446">Here is another situation where an error of the judge in the trial is highlighted, and one which competent counsel should have been able to call attention to.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.197" offset="2516198">There is also, Your Honor, a statement in this record where the sheriff says that -- that Parker admitted signing the checks and the -- this is one of the elements in this case that just amazes me more than any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.054" offset="2583594">Here, we have the -- the square language or Article 727 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure which we set forth on page 5 in our brief that the confession shall not be used if at the time it was made, the defendant was in jail or other place of confinement, nor while he was in the custody of an officer, unless made in the voluntary statement of accused taken before an examining court or made in writing and signed by him after all kinds of warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.680" offset="2702085">And not only did this come in the testimony, it was relied upon by the Court of Criminal Appeals in affirming his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.370" offset="2740851">It was stated by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in denying his writ of habeas corpus and is referred to twice in the brief for respondent in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.952" offset="2783169">Now, granted it came into evidence and certainly, it has been relied upon ever since then to the detriment of this petitioner and I submit that it would never come in if petitioner had had a counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2097.598" offset="8493746">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.387" offset="8520913">It is the contention of respondent in this case, sir, that the real question before this Court embodies the question of whether the Court has lost jurisdiction because the question has in fact become moot as was discussed by Mr. Wozencraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.723" offset="8618297">Certain things have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.262" offset="8628433">On June the 6th, 1959, petitioner was freed from all restraint and that respondent here and Mr. O.B. Ellis, who's the General Manager of the Texas Prison System, freed him, has been -- no longer has him in any type of custody or confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.721" offset="8710248">It is the position of respondent that the purpose of the great writ of habeas corpus is to be used by one who is unlawfully confined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.034" offset="8767509">Now throughout the record, petitioner asked for one thing in his application, to be freed from unlawful restraint and imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.114" offset="8815783">That restraint or imprisonment, lawful or unlawful, no longer exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.138" offset="8843891">Calling your attention to Title 28, Section 2241 of the Code where it in Subsection (c) it states that, “The writ of habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisoner unless -- paragraph 3, he is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.171" offset="8952038">If I may, I would like to briefly quote from the concurring opinion by Mr. Justice Stewart in the case of Heflin versus United States where he stated, “The very office of the great writ, its only function is to inquire into the legality of the detention of one in custody.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.538" offset="9045556">It is unnecessary to paraphrase here Mr. Justice Stone's penetrating discussion in McNally versus Hill, 293 U.S. 131, or to incorporate the thorough review of legal history there contained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.906" offset="9115042">It will suffice to note only the Court's decision -- Court's conclusion, excuse me, without restraint of liberty, the writ will not issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.060" offset="9163630">Equally without restraint which is unlawful, the writ may not be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.939" offset="9191111">A sentence which the prisoner has not begun to serve cannot be the cause of restraint which the statute makes the subject of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.929" offset="9231130">And I might add to that, that a sentence which has already been served is no longer a restraint which the statute makes the subject of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.516" offset="9289435">I should also like to call the Court's attention to the case of St. Pierre versus the United States which is a case almost identical in point to the case before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.775" offset="9346487">There, Pierre -- St. Pierre was convicted of contempt of -- having contempt to court rather and was assessed five months in the penitentiary or in -- he was assessed five months in confinement and he asked for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.539" offset="9417540">And before this Court could decide the question involved, he had been discharged and the mootness question arose in that case and this Court held in that case that we are of opinion that the case is moot because after petitioner's service of his sentence and its expiration, there was no longer a subject matter on which the judgment of this Court could operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.939" offset="9539166">A federal court is without power to decide moot questions or to give advisory opinions which cannot affect the rights of the litigants in the case before it and they're citing some cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.025" offset="9599457">And the Court continued, the sentence cannot be enlarged by this Court's judgment and reversal of the judgment below cannot operate to undo what has been done or restored to petitioner the penalty of the term of imprisonment which he has served.</text>
