            <label>Mr. Clendon H. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="94.946" offset="483140">Well, the Government did not raise, at any point, the issue of corporate capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.700" offset="506128">Now, if they were to raise that point either under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 or Federal Rule 9, then they would be in a position to raise that point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.588" offset="545729">The manner in which they've raised it, they're asking this Court to create a nationwide body of corporate incapacity in complete violation and in complete conflict with the Erie Railroad against Tompkins, they're asking this Court without having the charter, the colonial charter of Trinity Church here, on appeal on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.870" offset="638830">They're asking this Court, in effect, to do away with the Dartmouth College case when Trinity Church is not a party to this proceeding.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="141.351" stopTime="154.784">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="141.351" offset="668818">Well, I -- I didn't suppose that the corporate capacity would come directly under review, but -- but might it not be -- might it not be important to determine whether it was a gift or not?</text>

          <turn speaker="clendon_h_lee" startTime="154.784" stopTime="467.006">
            <label>Mr. Clendon H. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="154.784" offset="722526">The Government could have raised that point, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.927" offset="731094">And the Government stipulated on trial in the reply brief that's referred to on record pages 18 and page 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.618" offset="809880">The Government stipulated that the only question involved was the question of the nature of the payment to Mr. Stanton.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.053" offset="839555">Now, here, they have purported to raise a question of corporate capacity and they have done that not through the familiar process of stating that Congress, for purposes of bankruptcy, for purposes of taxation, for so many purposes, may describe the legal incidence of certain transactions, may say what consequences flow for the purposes of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.198" offset="936208">They have said, “Instead, we must go back and find an inherent corporate incapacity to make a gift.”</text>
            <text syncTime="215.260" offset="964420">And they have done so by citing a few cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.306" offset="976645">We only got the Government's brief and printer's proof form of 78 pages plus 30-page appendix on last Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.341" offset="1000782">And I'm afraid I haven't been able to deal in detail with all their points.But they cite questions like Rogers again Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.662" offset="1026069">Hill is relating to eluding the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.252" offset="1040384">I don't think they have any bearing on this point at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.829" offset="1054699">This inveterate principle of federal corporation law apparently wasn't clear to the Government just a few weeks before, when it did the Duberstein brief and they're asking this Court in the first instance, to promulgate this federal rule of corporate incapacity and we submit that it's wholly improper for that question to be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.070" offset="1139649">And the Government attempts to put this Court in that position by conceding all the evidentiary facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.623" offset="1169847">The case of Mr. Stanton is not referred to in the Government's brief until page 77.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.870" offset="1190849">They concede the evidentiary fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.095" offset="1199731">They expressly concede, on page 77 of their brief that the vestry and director who is part of the corporation necessarily, intended to make a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.632" offset="1253857">And I think they must necessarily be understood as also conceding that the majority in the Court of Appeals below made certain patent errors in reviewing the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.839" offset="1306728">Now, one of those particular errors, I -- I should like to refer to at some length, unless this Court perhaps, not perceive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.966" offset="1343195">The resolution awarding the gratuity to Stanton, which appears on page 4 of the main brief -- page 5 of the main brief, “Be it resolved that in appreciation of the services rendered by Mr. Stanton as manager of the estate and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.585" offset="1409755">A gratuity is hereby awarded him of $20,000 and so on.”</text>
            <text syncTime="334.234" offset="1440266">And then, there's a proviso, “Provided that with the discontinuance of his services, the corporation of Trinity Church is released from all rights and claims to pension and retirement benefits, not already accrued up to November 30, 1942.”</text>
            <text syncTime="355.778" offset="1526471">Mr. Stanton resigned on November 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.582" offset="1549667">His -- this resolution was adopted November 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.197" offset="1576208">The effective date of his resignation was November 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.366" offset="1596792">Under this resolution, any treatment of the gift to him, as anything other than a gift, was precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.628" offset="1645902">If Stanton had died, his legal representatives could never have maintained that further pension rights accrued after the effective date of his resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.539" offset="1689579">He no more gave up anything under this resolution, than he gave up future salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.434" offset="1717060">There is -- the resolution itself is really the -- the copper riveting, so far as the vestry was concerned, to preclude its being treated for corporate purposes or by legal representatives as anything other than a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.439" offset="1793128">Now, having referred to that one particular error and the Government having conceded it on its brief in this Court, I think that it might have been perhaps preferable if they had joined in petitioner's petition for rehearing in the Second Circuit to permit the Second Circuit to correct that error.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.648" offset="1885915">And then consider its opinion in that light, rather than trying to precipitate the issue in this Court with the Duberstein case at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.432" offset="1933145">Now, I shan't, at this point, refer to the clusters of evidentiary facts which are recited on pages 24 and 25.</text>

            <label>Mr. Clendon H. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="472.354" offset="1992808">The factual error is an error in Judge Hands' opinion where he stated that, “Stanton gave something up under this proviso which would presumably be some variety of consideration.”</text>
            <text syncTime="488.593" offset="2057697">In lieu of his pension rights, he got this, which isn't a fact at all, because he got all of his pension rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.439" offset="2097089">And it's the misreading of that proviso which the Government conceives, I believe, under its brief -- in its brief in this case, which caused that unfortunate mistake in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.951" offset="2139199">And that's why I say that would've come with better grace, if the Government had joined in our petitioner for rehearing in the Second Circuit.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="517.346" offset="2172740">Do you -- do you ask us to read that -- read out that language above pension -- pension rights entirely as being -- as being inconsequential?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="clendon_h_lee" startTime="527.386" stopTime="988.024">
            <label>Mr. Clendon H. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="527.386" offset="2212968">It is completely inconsequential, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.869" offset="2222895">And if it's to be given any meaning at all, it reinforces the nature of this as an outright grant without consideration, because he kept everything which had accrued through the effective date of his resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.213" offset="2288201">And in the record, page 34 in the record, one of the trustees of the pension fund refers to his voting to refund the money, that is Stanton's own contribution, which he was entitled to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.827" offset="2378689">On page 51 of the record, Stanton had contributed $1590 to the pension plan of Trinity Church and $594 to the pension plan of Trinity's real estate subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.745" offset="2490389">These amounts were refunded to him which was one of the elections which he could take under the pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.841" offset="2522781">So that he did not give up anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.288" offset="2536573">He received the $20,000 gratuity and he had the option or the election of either leaving that in the pension plan or taking a cash refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.055" offset="2579623">And he took the cash refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.057" offset="2591640">And it's just that one unfortunate error, which I want -- wanted to refer to at some length here, before going into the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.474" offset="2633226">The Government relies upon this Court's opinion in 1956, Commissioner against LoBue or LoBue, in which a Stock Option Plan was offered to employees as an inducement, as an incentive to keep them on the job, to promote the business of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.173" offset="2756106">Now -- so the Government says, “This substitutes motive for intent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="670.471" offset="2785259">And bearing in mind Mr. Justice Frankfurter's remarks yesterday on the unfortunate necessity of dealing with states of mind, I should like, if I may, to refer specifically and perhaps pedantically to the LoBue case.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.093" offset="2843773">This Court unanimously, speaking through Mr. Justice Black, and I've quoted this on page 7 of petitioner's reply brief, stated, “But there's not the slightest indication of the kind of detached and disinterested generosity which might evidence a gift in the statutory sense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="706.779" offset="2930500">These transferors of stock bore none of the earmarks of a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.177" offset="2952129">They were not made by a company engaged -- they were made by a company engaged in operating a business for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.871" offset="2974908">And the Tax Court found that the Stock Option Plan was designed to achieve more profitable operations by providing the employees with an incentive to promote the growth of the company by permitting them to participate in its success.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.628" offset="3033840">Under these circumstances, the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals properly refrained from treating this transfer as a gift, that company was not giving away something for nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.544" offset="3085563">Now, in the Stanton case, something was given away for nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.252" offset="3100400">There was no past consideration because he got $22,500 a year, salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.684" offset="3122134">His successor got approximately half that.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.362" offset="3136867">So, in Mr. Justice Brandeis' language, “Past services had fully requited.”</text>
            <text syncTime="765.026" offset="3163512">No further acquittance was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.594" offset="3181798">There was no future consideration because he did nothing, nor did he refrained from doing anything in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.484" offset="3209279">There was no covenant not to compete, no consultation.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.883" offset="3226937">It was not a substitute for the pension rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.127" offset="3243865">It was not consideration in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.180" offset="3256090">Now, we believe that the key to intent to make a gift lies in the presence or absence of consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.707" offset="3298200">This is the traditional element of a gift, an absolute grant without consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.493" offset="3329337">Without consideration is the realistic test.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.981" offset="3347310">Motive can never be a realistic test.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.482" offset="3361311">Motive, if this Court were to direct the lower courts to pursue motives, we would have the sort of the question which I had to participate in several years ago in the Third Circuit, where the Government revoked retroactively, the tax-exempt status of a charity on the ground that the assets of that charity might have been used to provide a source of raw materials, if needed by the donors and the founders of that charitable foundation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3463.275" offset="13956472">And by the same token, a corporation cannot commit a crime including tax fraud, we strip it of all intent, all will, all emotional coloration and we say that that has been the law since the beginning of the republic.</text>
