            <text syncTime="24.372" offset="200808">It is distinguishable from Raines in that Raines involved the question of their being placed upon the registration rolls in the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.237" offset="256293">In this case, the District Judge, in his decree, held that the action involved massive discrimination against these Negro voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.425" offset="329122">The various acts that were involved resulted from challenges under the statute of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.213" offset="368201">The statute of Louisiana provides for challenges in a certain manner and that is set out in a Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.096" offset="407803">The challenges maybe made by persons, voters who will swear out affidavits in regard to the discrepancy in a form that is described in the statute and it's exhibit here in our brief, in which this discrepancies are raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.534" offset="501530">Then the Registrar acts upon those affidavits which are to be sworn out before the Registrar or his deputy.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.665" offset="578017">In this case, if the record is clear, it's submitted that no examination of any ward in regard to whether voters were in compliance with the requirements of the registration laws was made where there were no Negro voters in that ward.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.011" offset="671431">There were only 10 white voters' registrations, who were challenged in any way in Washington Parish in connection with this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.948" offset="723153">The record is clear that the Registrar who deals with these records day by day and continuously over a long period of years that he described, knew that over 50% of the registrations' records of the white voters in this parish had exactly the same kind of discrepancies that were found to be sufficient under these challenges to remove these colored voters from the registration rolls of this parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.572" offset="865677">There were 1514, colored voters registered in that parish before this action occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.647" offset="906010">By this action, 1377 of those 1514 were removed from the rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.461" offset="953240">There are over 11,000 white, 11,444 to be exact, on the registration rolls in this parish and only 10 of them were challenged.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="242.616" offset="1073821">The Registrar has to act but as a part of proceedings, it is shown at the Registrar here, Mr. Thomas, brought an action for declaratory judgment in which he said these people were harassing, interfering with the conduct of his office and that he wanted an adjudication as to whether or not he had to make these removals from the registration rolls and whether or not it would be a violation of the injunction outstanding against him from 1950 in which he was directed by a Federal District Court not to discriminate against any voters in the registration by reason of their race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.715" offset="1262216">And in this proceeding, the state District Judge held that he -- his function was ministerial and that he had no discretion and that he was, as soon as the challenge was filed that he was to proceed to remove them from the rolls that was his duty.</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="308.576" offset="1337657">Does that mean he must remove them from the rolls or does he have a discretion, after a challenge has been initiated by these two affidavits, send out a notice, then when the voter responds to make the determination for himself as to qualifications?</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="325.921" offset="1407039">Well yes, but if there was no response I think is a fair interpretation of the state judge's decision, then he had no discretion that it was his – then his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.979" offset="1455313">Now, there is an affidavit provided for in the state law, state statutes, in which they can respond by getting three voters to swear on affidavit on their behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.116" offset="1527829">This affidavit is a -- a limited form and it's provided that they are residents of the district in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.960" offset="1567222">The Court held this affidavit in the form required by the Louisiana laws will be no answer to these particular discrepancies because the -- the Court said that they would have to swear out an affidavit in which they would say that these particular discrepancies did not appear or did not occur on the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="389.634" offset="1661889">Now do I understand, I mean to get this point clear in my mind, that it has been held by some court down there, that in the (Inaudible) of response by the voter, you have thus been challenged, you used the affidavits in the statutory laws, the Registrar has no discretion to overrule the challenge, but must remove the voter from the rolls.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="422.716" offset="1794278">And -- and the issue is, I might add there issue was further raised by the Registrar whether this type of discrepancy was sufficient for them to be removed from the rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.707" offset="1850180">Now the discrepancies involved here were misspelling, the miscalculation of the age and illegibility and in a few cases, there is one about whether or not he was registered in any ward.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.923" offset="1911097">Now, it's the problem about age is where many of them missed the age by one day.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.181" offset="1944116">The state Attorney General has said that is not a disqualification, but the state court judge said it was and the missed one day, depends upon whether you're going to calculate it by figuring in the day of the filing or you figure it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.363" offset="2012871">Now, that's one and then the question of misspelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.989" offset="2035336">It's a -- a very interesting exhibit attached in the Appendix to the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.796" offset="2074520">To show you just how this worked in the operation and what in a front it is to the people of Louisiana, including these voters and the American people to be saying that these Negro voters were disqualified in the voting process by reason of what happened here.</text>

            <text syncTime="6620.026" offset="26583437">For instance, under the Louisiana registration system, the talk today on 245 is a challenging system opposed to the fact that these registered voters at one time had been a member of voting society because they were illegally placed upon the rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="6641.575" offset="26669641">Now reason why we say that is that under the constitution of Louisiana, we have a specific requirement as to be a registered voter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6650.253" offset="26704436">The constitution which is set out in our brief says, that you must be at least 21, you must live in the State of Louisiana or locale for certain amount of time and more importantly, you must be a registered voter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6664.006" offset="26759398">Now, by being a registered voter, you must obey the requirements set out is both the constitution and in the legislative acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6672.871" offset="26794820">Now, as this situation is presently developed, what has happen here in Washington Parish is that these people originally, whenever qualified, they should never have been placed upon the rolls, whether they be white or whether they be black because under Louisiana law, under the constitution, the filling of the registration blank itself is a literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="6699.053" offset="26899623">Now, if you fail to pass the literacy test, that is the only time, the only time that the Registrar has any discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="6713.019" offset="26955421">Under 245 two registered voters come in and they say that they want to challenge me because I have done something wrong, I have misspelled a word, the registrar must -- under the Louisiana law, issue that challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6728.829" offset="27018637">He sends that challenge to me and it's up to me to get three registered voters to come in and attempt to traverse that affidavit.</text>
