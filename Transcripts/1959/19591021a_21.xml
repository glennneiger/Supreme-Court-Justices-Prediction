            <text syncTime="877.137" offset="3611878">One further thing I do have to say on severability is that there is a long and different history of those serving with or employed by the armed forces from those accompanying the armed forces as I shall try to set forth the categories of serving with and employed by, have really been in effect for over two centuries in explicit terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.067" offset="3695679">And they were in effect long before the Court Martial Law Revision of 1916 or the Court Martial Revision of 1950, but it was only in 1950 that Congress explicitly put in the category of “accompany.”</text>
            <text syncTime="913.794" offset="3758582">So you would have to say that Congress, in putting in the category of “accompanying,” which -- with which the Court dealt in Covert wanted also if that turned out to be invalid on a certain application, to bring down also the old jurisdiction which had been exercised we believe, for over two centuries before the word “accompanying” was inserted in the Court Martial Article in 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.401" offset="3857011">For these reasons, we don't think that there's really any substance to the position that the statute is so inseparable that the Court can fail to reach the constitutional issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.727" offset="3902255">And there is no other issue aside from severability other than the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.362" offset="3924825">Our general position on constitutionality is that this statute as applied in this and the succeeding cases stands on Article 1, Section 8, Clause 14 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.778" offset="3974457">There is a provision for Congress to make rules for the Government and regulation of the land and naval forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.538" offset="4001520">I shall try to develop that, but at this point I would like to say that the Court has consistently recognized not only in the recent cases of Toth and then Mr. Justice Black's opinion in the Covert case, but in the earlier Hawaiian court-martial case of Duncan against Kahanamoku, that persons who are not members of the armed forces, not enlisted or commissioned, do not wear a uniform, can be covered in appropriate circumstances under court-martial jurisdictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1040.839" offset="4266715">We think that in the light of its history and its purposes, it is unnecessary to invoke the necessary and proper clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.411" offset="4300988">But we would invoke it if it were necessary to do so, because we think that the necessary and proper clause does apply to the court-martial Clause, to Clause 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.022" offset="4351457">We, of course, believe as the Court indicated in Covert that consideration has to be given to the matter of jury trial and to the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.854" offset="4390745">And that the Constitution has to be considered as a whole in determining whether Article 2 (11) is valid as applied in this and the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.146" offset="4423973">And we have three bases of our argument that the Constitution does permit what was done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.382" offset="4448946">And the first is the historical basis with which I shall try mainly to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.670" offset="4466082">And the second is to show that there is a need for this type of military jurisdiction in the world today with American bases and -- and posts overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.103" offset="4503803">And that it is appropriate to subject the persons in these cases to such type of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.490" offset="4529298">And the third half of our argument, the third half is that there are no acceptable alternative methods for dealing with derelictions and crimes committed by these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.227" offset="4576319">On the matter of the history and we think the matter of history is significant because it gives content to the constitutional phrase “land and naval forces”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.786" offset="4614562">We think you determine how, what land and naval forces meant at the time the Constitution was adopted and what it means today by seeing the history as it's developed since the 17th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.248" offset="4664404">And I should like at the beginning, if I may, to give a general picture or survey of what we think the history shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.226" offset="4696273">I have four points to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.782" offset="4702542">I'm not certain I will be able to develop each of them as I go along, but I would like at least to put before the Court the four general points that I think are important in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.734" offset="4742353">And the first is, that from at least the middle of the 18th Century, at least the middle of the 18th Century, there has been what I think is a consistent legislation practice covering court-martial jurisdiction of a service connected personnel, service connected personnel particularly employees of the type involved in three of these cases but not solely over those employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.303" offset="4836603">There's been legislation, we think, for two centuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.944" offset="4847156">There's been consistent practice, not every year but over the period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.563" offset="4869622">And the second general proposition I'd like to put before Your Honors is that there was no general hostility at the time before the Constitution was adopted and at the time the adoption of the Constitution and after the Constitution was adopted to this type of court-martial jurisdiction, that is jurisdiction over service connected personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.506" offset="4961364">There was hostility, and this is the hostility upon which our opponents rely almost exclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.738" offset="4986337">There was hostility to the notion of court-martial jurisdiction over inhabitants generally, not service connected personnel, people who were living in the area of a fort or a garrison or around hostilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.714" offset="5038268">There was hostility to that kind of court-martial jurisdiction, but there was no hostility, we believe, to court-martial jurisdiction over service connected personnel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1446.979" offset="5891323">The only two that the opponents have brought forth are a statement by Lord Mansfield reminiscing about a matter in Gibraltar in 1738.</text>

            <text syncTime="1461.217" offset="5948270">And we think we show that in addition to all the other defects at the time Lord Mansfield was talking about, the British parliament had not given court-martial jurisdiction over the -- over that kind of treatment at places overseas, but it did some years later.</text>
