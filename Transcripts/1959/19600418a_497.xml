            <label>Mr. Henry W. Schober</label>
            <text syncTime="15.611" offset="165804">If it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.073" offset="175626">This matter is here on certiorari issued by this Court to the Court of Appeals of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.419" offset="201017">To review a judgment of affirmance entered by that Court, affirming a judgment of conviction entered in the County Court of Nassau County for the State of New York convicting the defendant of the felony murder of one Sunday Graham.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.106" offset="283773">The question that we raised and upon which we are here is whether a confession obtained from the petitioner was secured in violation of due process as accorded to him and guaranteed to him under those provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.579" offset="377710">In considering and approaching that question, we feel that we should bring before this Court those factual circumstances which are conceded by the respondent to have existed with regard to the development of the investigation and ultimate securing of the confession and which are undisputed in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.838" offset="486693">In approaching this problem and giving some of the background of the crime itself and of the investigation that was conducted, may I call attention first to the fact that the respondent Phillips, a male Negro of the -- of the age of approximately 42 years have had prior conflicts with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.927" offset="575091">He had been convicted on a prior occasion in this very country, the Country of Nassau of the crime of attempted rape by violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.842" offset="622738">He was sentenced to imprisonment for that crime and having been released on parole, he was later again apprehended, charged with a violation of his parole for the commission of a sexual offense upon a young white girl.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.275" offset="696508">And upon the charge for violation of parole in that instance, he was recommitted for a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.253" offset="740394">The petitioner Phillips had sometime prior to the commission of the crime charged here been married to one Manita Graham (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="172.638" offset="793893">They had been divorced but they had continued an illicit relationship between them subsequent to time of their divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.353" offset="836733">Mrs. Graham had adopted Sunday Graham who was approximately eight years of age upon the time -- about the time of her unfortunate demise.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.457" offset="885217">Now, on May 12, 1958, Sunday Graham was last seen leaving the school which she was attending.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.874" offset="938820">She was dressed in a school uniform and was seen by one of her playmates to enter an automobile driven by a male Negro, a car of a type kind that was owned by Phillips and driven by one who is dressed in clothing such as that which had been possessed by Phillips at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.662" offset="1046026">Once she did not -- when Sunday did not return to her home, Mrs. Graham, at about 5:30 in the evening of that day, made report to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.406" offset="1088972">And she gave them the information concerning a prior marriage to the petitioner and stated also to the police that petitioner had followed her within a short period of time prior to the disappearance of Sunday and had expressed certain threats to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.126" offset="1171832">But Mrs. Graham had asked Phillips to get out of her life, and he stated to her in return that if he did get out of her life, he would not get out alone and that she would be sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.179" offset="1256051">About 10:15 on the evening of the day of Sunday's disappearance, the local police precinct in the village of Hempstead, Nassau County communicated with the precinct of the country police that had jurisdiction over that location.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.952" offset="1347166">And at about 10:20 on that evening, the country police officers were given a description of a missing girl, the location of the school at which she had been attending and the other information such as I have just mentioned to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.489" offset="1429295">The following morning, the country police spoke to the classmate of Sunday who had seen her entering the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.519" offset="1477465">They obtained the information from that classmate, Kathy Mullen (ph) concerning the place at which the automobile was seen, the person driving and the fact that Sunday attended.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.780" offset="1542457">At 11 a.m. because of the information that had been obtained by the police concerning Phillips' background in relationship with Mrs. Graham and Sunday, visited Phillips' home in Hempstead, searched his rooms and took clothes from him that he had been wearing and that were in his apartment and also had him identified through them the automobile which he owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.600" offset="1673801">They questioned him concerning Sunday Graham and his -- and her disappearance and then requested that he accompany them, the police, to their local police precinct some distance away and beyond the place where police headquarters of the county are located.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.697" offset="1762200">They arrived at the local police precinct at about 1:15 in the afternoon of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.847" offset="1790725">And at that time, the interrogation concerning this disappearance of Sunday Graham began.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="430.036" offset="1823535">You claimed that he was under arrest at this time or did he went over there voluntarily?</text>

            <text syncTime="435.283" offset="1844537">The record would seem to indicate that he accompanied them voluntarily, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.697" offset="1862196">But we say that whether he was under arrest or whether he had gone voluntarily, that the fact of his going and the circumstances that took place from that point on are to be considered in connection with the ultimate determination to be made by this Court on the question that we say is presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.222" offset="1944221">But we do -- we do say that so far as the police officers are concerned, they expressly testified that it was not until some time later that Phillips was actually placed under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.694" offset="2002108">The testimony in substance on that score being that he was requested to stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.144" offset="2031992">That he could have left had he indicated his desire to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.318" offset="2056652">That he would not have been restrained in his leaving.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.038" offset="2071489">And that it was only after the violated dead body of this young girl was found that he would've had difficulty in leaving.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.298" offset="2112554">We say that these two is a plot of the totality of circumstances such as this Court has referred to in determining the effect of all of the things that have occurred here.</text>

            <text syncTime="519.811" offset="2182666">There is no question about that but we say that whether or not a crime had in fact been committed prior to that time or whether there was knowledge of the commission of that crime, it becomes immaterial when you now currently consider all of the things that went before, after and immediately at the time that a confession was ultimately obtained.</text>

            <text syncTime="2566.990" offset="10371323">And there were -- was an occasion then when the detectives in the main spoke to Assistant District Attorney (Inaudible) the -- the ultimate prosecutor of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.117" offset="10447809">And there is no clear indication of the person or persons with whom Phillips was left on that -- at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.763" offset="10478425">In any event, it was at about 4:15 a.m. of May 14 that the request was forwarded to the report (Inaudible) to come to the police station for the purpose of taking a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.955" offset="10539238">And it was about 4:30 that the Assistant District Attorney (Inaudible) first on -- to question Phillips and continued examining him and interrogating him until 5:10 in the morning at which time the first break in Phillips story came along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.670" offset="10606007">Now, this was not the time when Mr. (Inaudible) stated to Phillips that they had found blood on his underclothing and inquired Phillips at that time of his knowledge concerning Sunday Graham.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.704" offset="10674239">It was then also that Phillips stated to Mr. (Inaudible) that he was sorry and then asked that the -- the police officers be brought in to him so that he could shake their hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.411" offset="10737037">That he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.965" offset="10743202">The examination continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.034" offset="10751457">The complete confession was obtained from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.522" offset="10765458">But we say that the confession itself must be read in the light of the prior interrogation and of Phillips' statement, not disputed or anywise answered, that he had been subjected to brainwash.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.225" offset="10824286">That he was parroted what had been told to him by the police officers and that he was taking the easy way out of the continued interrogation and questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.326" offset="10872665">We say that reading that it will be seen that his answers in effect state that the factual matter included by the Assistant District Attorney in his questions were as good as any factual matters that Phillips himself might state in his answers and that -- in that fashion, we say that it's -- he's born out that he was accepting the version that was given to him by others, stating that his mind was a blank concerning the occurrence, he was merely repeating what others had told him concerning a claim occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.731" offset="11030340">We say that -- considering the fact that he had been awake since some 6 o'clock was 6:15 on the morning of May 13 that he had no sleep, no food, nothing to drink, nothing to smoke and in spite of the fact that the respondent points out that on six occasions, there were request, I withdraw that, that on four occasions, there were requests made to him as to whether he desired food and on two others, their food was offered to be brought to him that nevertheless, here was a man who did not have sleep, rest, food or drink and that these are circumstances to be considered in -- during the inferences concerning the state of mind in which he was as the result of the questioning which began at 1:15 of the afternoon before, his state of mind and his ability to resist or retain and keep his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.810" offset="11334614">We say that under those circumstances viewed in that light, there can be no determination that this was the result of his freedom of choice that he had any freedom of will in the matter but that actually what was occurring that was -- that he had been subjected completely to the will of his detainers and that when viewed in the light of the statements by Officer Rouffet, who said that they kept him for the purpose of extracting a confession from him that this was clear proof that what they --</text>

            <text syncTime="2954.340" offset="11920697">And that being so, that there are sufficient undisputed conceded facts in this record from which the inexorable conclusion must be that this was not a free, voluntary, uncoerced statement by the -- by the petitioner but was rather a compelled one, that its introduction know by his objection during the course of the trial was improper and constituted a denial of his rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="3020.528" offset="12185475">Now, we point out to this Court that there were a number of police officers who saw and were in Phillips presence or in -- who had him in their custody on occasions when Stock and Rouffet were not present so that any denial by them in that regard is to be taken as a denial only of circumstances occurring while they were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.842" offset="12294771">On the other hand, there -- there are the statements by Phillips, the petitioner, were on cross-examination, and we say that this cross-examination is to be viewed to in the light of the record as it stands at that time, who stated that he was pushed around and forced to do different things, that he was brainwashed, that he barely parroted what others suggested to him because it was the easiest way out, that he wasn't able to resist.</text>

            <text syncTime="3281.112" offset="13227865">Your Honors, you've just enjoyed a -- an extraordinarily fair statement of the facts in the record from Mr. Schober as to the basic facts in his presentation, I have no quarrel.Some of the inferences that he draws principally in his briefs more or so than here on the argument this afternoon, I do quarrel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.924" offset="13335071">What I'd like to do was confine my argument just to the facts in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.140" offset="13363911">I believe from the comments that were made from the bench, some of the points that were covered in the respondent's brief as to the length of the questioning as to a murder investigation, as already been observed by the Court, through the petitioner was with the police at the third precinct in Williston Park from 1:15 in the afternoon until 3 a.m. the following morning when he was moved to police headquarters, but it was not until sometime between 4 or 5 o'clock when there was positive identification of the body of Sunday Graham that the police were conducting a murder investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.221" offset="13560247">Up to that time, Detective Rouffet had been carrying on this all by himself if there were -- if there was any overzealousness by the police, it was Rouffet who, starting the night before, gave up his sleep, searching around Hempstead, looking for this little girl to reunite her with her family, and he was the one almost unaided that questioned the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.804" offset="13662542">And it was very intimate questioning up until the time of the discovery of the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.309" offset="13692635">Now, during the argument and in the briefs for the petitioner, Mr. Schober points out that from Hempstead where the child was found -- was supposed to come home from school, the petitioner was leaving.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.324" offset="13764629">The police came, took him from Hempstead to East Williston and in the petitioner's brief they say, the reason is not explained in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.319" offset="13800678">Quite simply, the precinct which has geographical jurisdiction over the village of Hempstead is physically located in East Williston.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.977" offset="13843310">Why the police brought this petitioner to East Williston, was because they had -- that was the only facility available for conducting this local investigation into a missing child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.297" offset="13908511">The petitioner also complains that the record fail to explain why at 3 a.m. in the depth of the night, he was moved to police headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.622" offset="13945814">There is no explanation on the record other than the chief of detectives had his base of operations in headquarters and didn't go out to all the 28 police departments and 8 precincts of the county police.</text>

            <text syncTime="4273.758" offset="17198373">The early -- but this was one statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.788" offset="17210493">The early part of this statement is remarkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4280.168" offset="17224077">Phillips in addition of being intelligent is an extremely articulate individual with a mask of almost total recall of specific detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.731" offset="17266291">This part of his question and answer statement that he was -- gave to the Assistant District Attorney was almost exactly the same as he had given earlier before the discovery of the body to Detective Rouffet and that he gave license numbers, names of people he met, detailers involved, itinerary had taken the day of the crime, so as to place himself far away from the location of the school or the corner near the school were Sunday had been picked up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4324.002" offset="17399411">Incidentally, the description that was furnished by Sunday's classmate could have fit anyone of thousands and thousands of Negro men in the village of Hempstead to say nothing of the rest to the County of Nassau.</text>

            <text syncTime="4346.531" offset="17489481">Up to that, the statement was a tissue of lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.412" offset="17505050">There was -- this was the one thing that when he was confronted with it, he realized that he could not lie away from.</text>

            <text syncTime="4367.395" offset="17572968">Here was the man who -- when he is confronted by that, calls the -- asked the Assistant District Attorney call in those police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.356" offset="17616750">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.722" offset="17618213">The point, the matters, “He kicked me, he beat me,” no, to shake hands with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4385.860" offset="17646843">In their reply brief -- in the reply brief, the petitioner says, "Well, these put up evidence on number of things,” the shaking of the hands, evidence that he was finally so overcome, so overborne that it was significant of the fact that he was giving in capitulating.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.179" offset="17720090">We can assume all kinds of things as to why he shook hands with these officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.877" offset="17738898">He might have been congratulating among their appointments or promotions, that was beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.835" offset="17766693">If this was the man who on cross-examine -- while being pressed on cross-examination and tried to wiggle out of the Assistant D.A.'s questions as to why his testimony deferred from the answers he gave in his question and answer statement that he was beaten, would he shake hands with him?</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.364" offset="17848822">We say it's inconceivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4437.948" offset="17855195">Further, the record shows that the police exceeded to his request to call in a priest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4446.832" offset="17890722">He was Catholic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.735" offset="17894275">The little girl and her mother -- the entire family was Catholic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4452.672" offset="17914023">He was -- the police called in a priest right away.</text>
            <text syncTime="4456.174" offset="17928025">They brought in Manita Graham and Curtis Maddox again.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.964" offset="17943280">They arraign them at the very first opportunity at 10 a.m.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.389" offset="17964910">Following the arraignment, Phillips voluntarily agreed with them to go out and visit the scenes of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4471.762" offset="17990405">Now, is this -- is this conceivable that a man who claims for the first time on his trial that he was beaten?</text>
            <text syncTime="4480.366" offset="18024887">After arraignment before a judge would thereafter voluntarily, drive around the county with the police?</text>
