            <text syncTime="81.589" offset="429746">In 1926, he went to work on the waterfront and worked there until 1949 when he was elected Secretary-Treasurer of the Local 1346 in the port New York which is affiliated with the International Longshoremen's Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.411" offset="501008">That election was held by the (Inaudible) Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.804" offset="518562">In 1953, the State of New York legislated Section 8, which prevented anyone who is convicted of a felony to be a union officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.217" offset="576240">In 1953, after the statute was legislated, the De Veau commenced an action in the Southern District Court of New York to test the constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.939" offset="623156">At that time, the Waterfront Commission and the District Attorneys of New York put the position that it did not apply to De Veau.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.304" offset="652622">And sometime after that, the case of Calabrese and Hazelton was commenced in the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.532" offset="693478">There, the constitutionality of Section 8 was upheld on the grounds that it was -- within the police power of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.698" offset="734124">In 1955, before the decision of Hazelton versus Murray, De Veau again ran for office and was elected by the membership who knew of his past felony and this election was also conducted by the (Inaudible) Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.839" offset="814686">The compact was divided into three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.698" offset="830151">Part one, does not contain Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.901" offset="843003">It sets up the recommendations made to Congress and which the Congress passed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.161" offset="864005">Section 8, is contained at part three, in which Congress did not pass on and therefore did not ratify Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.616" offset="905801">We take the position that Section 8 is in conflict with Section 7, in that Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act pre-empts the States from taking any action as to setting up qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.703" offset="962226">We base this on a Hill versus Florida case in which the Court there ruled as I state may not set up qualifications as to union officers or representatives of unions which employees have the right to free choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="503.998" offset="2119346">Now, the International office of the ILA is in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.215" offset="2136273">So it becomes broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.842" offset="2142751">It -- it actually extends its power into these areas and to these other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.703" offset="2174203">The law specifically spells out that any felony of any state and we know there are some felonies in some States which are against public policy in New York namely the Crime of (Inaudible) and which would be a hardship.</text>

            <text syncTime="1461.169" offset="5948061">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.564" offset="5973661">The District Attorney of Richmond County who is the appellee in this matter before Your Honors takes the position in the outset that this matter has become moot in that there is no longer a bona fide controversy existing between the appellant George De Veau and the appellee, the District Attorney of Richmond County in his official capacity and that this has arisen through acts and conduct not on the part of the District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.815" offset="6126634">The port of New York is a large sprawling area encompassing three counties within the city of New York and various counties in the state of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.565" offset="6177625">Staten Island or Richmond County is one small part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.517" offset="6197478">At the time of the initiation of this action, there were four separate and distinct Locals involved with the checkers of cargo on the piers throughout the Port of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.742" offset="6262366">Each of these locals had certain territorial limitations, 1346 of which De Veau was Secretary-Treasurer had by charter of the territory of Richmond County, New York, Staten therefore, when it was made known to the District Attorney of Richmond County of the possible conflict between or with Section 8 of the Waterfront Commission Act because of De Veau previous conviction of a crime, the District Attorney of Richmond County was the office of cognizable with that statute in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.036" offset="6419519">And as a result of that, it was called for the attention of the International and the International, the president of the International Longshoreman's Association at that time in independent suspended De Veau.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.832" offset="6478660">No prosecution was begun by the District Attorney under Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.608" offset="6501752">The interna -- or De Veau and other members of 1346 originally instituted this action in the Supreme Court of Richmond County or a declaratory judgment and for an injunction restraining the District Attorney of Richmond County from enforcing Section 8 as against De Veau in his capacity as Secretary-Treasurer of Local 1346 or anyone else because of De Veau's position as Secretary-Treasurer of 1346.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.256" offset="6644381">Subsequently it now appears that the union on its own abolished 1346 and issued a new charter to a new local called Local 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.891" offset="6722957">A copy of that charter is annexed to our motion papers to dismiss the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.770" offset="6758484">The charter provides only that this new local shall jurisdiction over all checkers throughout the Port of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.255" offset="6800384">The charter says, absolutely nothing as to any merger with other locals and it provides simply that there shall be officers and it provides that there shall be I believe four Secretary-Treasurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.972" offset="6867257">It provides that they shall be elected in October of 1960, but it says absolutely nothing as to who shall function as officers in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.208" offset="6916159">I would point out to the Court, that at the time this charter was granted, De Veau was not an officer of 1346.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.763" offset="6958373">He had been suspended by the president of the International.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.679" offset="6978121">So that it would seem to the appellee that any action that would be taken now by this Court could not restore De Veau to any position in 1346 since it does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.560" offset="7045622">And it seems that all this Court is being asked to do is render an advisory opinion as to whether or not De Veau is qualified to be a candidate for office next October.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.165" offset="7108002">And we urge therefore in keeping with the language and the sentiments expressed by this Court only yesterday that constitutional issues in the striking down the statute on the ground -- on constitutional grounds is -- one is a right to be exercised very sparingly and to be exercise -- and should not be exercised when there is no bona fide contest beginning upon.</text>

            <text syncTime="2303.320" offset="9316603">For many years, there had been great concern as to certain conditions existing in Waterfront Labor Organizations in the Port of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.082" offset="9355682">A Committee or a Commission rather known at various times as the New York State Crime Commission or the (Inaudible) Committee conducted investigations over a period of several years in which they went into the question of certain abuses and corrupt practices in the Port of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.548" offset="9445543">In their report, they determined that over 30% of the officials of waterfront labor unions in the Port of New York had criminal records of various kinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.215" offset="9496221">They found as a fact that this condition gave rise to many abuses, many violations of law to extortion from the union employees or form of kickbacks, the so-called notorious shake system that pilferage and larceny from the Port of New York were all -- were tremendous in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.345" offset="9596740">These recommendations were forwarded to the Governor of New York who then hold -- who then held rather further hearings on the matter along with the law enforcement council of New Jersey and further evidence was adduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.948" offset="9667166">Your Honors will find reference at length to these matters in the brief of the Waterfront Commission of the Port of New York who filed the brief amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.691" offset="9710111">Based upon these findings, both the States of New York and New Jersey legislation was proposed which led to the creation of a new bi-state agency known as the Waterfront Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.573" offset="9773641">Now, it is true that the legislation itself is divided into three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.955" offset="9795166">The first part is the actual contract or agreement between the two States to create this agency to police the Port of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.409" offset="9845008">And both States found that this waterfront crafts and the people who worked them, longshoremen, checkers and the like, that these occupations smacked of the public interest and it was in the public interest to regulate or control them in some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.436" offset="9925151">Now, the compact provided that certain of these of occupations should licensed and that a license must be granted in order for a man to practice that occupation on the Waterfront of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.971" offset="9995264">And it is interesting to note that these appellant, De Veau could not at the moment practice the occupation of checker in the Port of New York, even though he seeks to be representative of the checkers.</text>
