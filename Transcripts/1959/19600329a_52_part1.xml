            <label>Mr. Harvey M. Grossman</label>
            <text syncTime="28.200" offset="216168">Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Associate Justices of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.807" offset="238634">Petitioner Jose Rios has been convicted of unlawful possession of narcotics and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment solely on the basis of evidence which petitioner asserts was obtained in violation of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.482" offset="297253">The evidence was obtained by state officers and previously suppressed in a state prosecution under the exclusionary rule prevailing in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.187" offset="336123">This Court has granted certiorari to determine two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.695" offset="354200">First, was the evidence in question in fact obtained in violation of the constitutional rights of the petitioner or defendant?</text>
            <text syncTime="72.328" offset="392652">Secondly, if the evidence was so obtained, was it nevertheless admissible under the so-called silver platter doctrine because obtained by state rather than federal officers?</text>
            <text syncTime="85.362" offset="444792">First, the factual context in which these questions have to be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.121" offset="463809">On February 18th, 1957, plain clothes officers Beckmann and Grace of the Los Angeles police force observed the defendant enter a taxicab at the vicinity of First and Flower Streets, an intersection near the Los Angeles Pacific Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.730" offset="542281">The time was shortly after 10:00 p.m.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.362" offset="560776">At the time, neither Officer Beckmann nor Officer Grace had a warrant for search of the cab or the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.792" offset="590555">They had no warrant of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.674" offset="598079">In fact, their own testimony states that they had no idea whatever as to the identity of the defendant, the cab, or the driver nor were they searching for a participant in any known crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.737" offset="650324">Nevertheless, they testified that they, and I quote, “stake out on the cab and then proceeded to follow it for some two miles until it arrived at First and State Streets”.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.019" offset="695463">Now, their explanation for what seems to be rather extraordinary conduct is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.188" offset="716152">First, they state, according to Officer Beckmann's testimony, that before the defendant entered the cab, he looked about up and down the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.145" offset="751992">Secondly, Officer Beckmann said that some three months previously, he had arrested another defendant not connected or anyway with defendant Rios in the same locality, and this defendant was also using a taxicab, so this paired to be a somewhat suspicious circumstance as far as Officer Beckmann was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.541" offset="833494">And finally, after the evidence was suppressed in the state court, Officer Beckmann testified that he recalled that the airy in question was one with a “bad reputation for narcotics”, whatever that may mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.888" offset="894934">Now, based upon this rather flimsy fact situation, which the Government itself conceded, do not constitute probable cause, the police proceeded to follow the cab for some two miles in an unmarked police vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.669" offset="958046">When the cab stopped momentarily for a traffic signal at First and State Streets, the police car pulled up behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.748" offset="990333">Officers Beckmann and Grace alighted and approached the cab on opposite sides and Officer Beckmann identified himself to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.694" offset="1026173">Now, with respect to Officer Beckmann's intentions in that regard, he testified in the state court that he was investigating narcotics, and later in the federal proceedings, added that it was his intention to see if defendant had any narcotics in his possession.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="247.880" offset="1094928">When they went up at the traffic light identified themselves, did they open the door of the cab and make entrance into the cab?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_m_grossman" startTime="257.545" stopTime="559.230">
            <label>Mr. Harvey M. Grossman</label>
            <text syncTime="257.545" offset="1133589">The testimony from this point on, I might say, and I was about to get into that, is a bit obscured, because Officer Beckmann told two stories here.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.064" offset="1179669">He told one story in the state court and after the state court suppressed the evidence, suddenly some months later he recalled the sequence of events a little differently, particularly from the standpoint of the timing of the search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.855" offset="1238810">Originally, Officer Beckmann testified, and I might say incidentally that while there is -- there are differences in the two factual presentations, we don't believe probable cause has established even if we take the best of the many versions which Officer Beckmann testified to.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.403" offset="1297011">And I might add that the state court's testimony was received in evidence in the federal prosecution pursuant to stipulation that Officer Beckmann would have testified the same at that time although he did proceed to get a different story.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.839" offset="1346748">Now, according to the original report Officer Beckmann filed shortly after the events in question, when he identified himself to the defendant, he saw the defendant extract a white object from his pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.181" offset="1404113">At that point, Officer Beckmann said he opened the door of the cab.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.243" offset="1424384">He states he didn't saw the defendant drop an object at his feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.151" offset="1439953">Now, when the officer testified in the federal court after the state court had suppressed the evidence, he testified somewhat differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.105" offset="1479764">This time, he testified that the defendant dropped the object before the door was opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.041" offset="1499512">And that now, it was not only Officer Beckmann but the defendant and Officer Beckmann who opened the door, a somewhat different version.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.750" offset="1534412">The cab driver who was called as a witness for the Government in the trial court, and I think was the only disinterested observer on the scene and whose testimony therefore would be entitled to some weight here, when called by the Government testified that while defendant was still in the cab, Officer Beckmann opened the door, grabbed defendant by the arm and brandish a revolver at which point the cab driver states he protested that while he was accustomed to routine police stopping at his cab and searches, the presence of a revolver seemed a peculiar circumstance and he felt that the officers' conduct was unjustified and testified he complained to Officer Beckmann.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.454" offset="1689161">So the cab driver's testimony corresponds with the original version of Officer Beckmann's testimony, namely, that Officer Beckmann opened the cab door, the cab driver adds he grabbed his arm, and this was prior to the time the object in question apparently had even been dropped.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.930" offset="1759065">Now, Officer Beckmann testifies as to two versions of the following events also.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.299" offset="1792606">In his original testimony, he states that after the object was removed from the defendant's pocket, at this point, we only know there is a white object, this is all he has noted, defendant dropped the objects on the floor of the cab, there's nothing said of any inspection and tempted to alight.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.969" offset="1867212">And at that point, Officer Beckmann grabbed him by the arm, according to his testimony, and said to the defendant, “You're under arrest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="447.780" offset="1894484">Beckmann then told his partner Officer Grace, “Pick up the object.”</text>
            <text syncTime="451.805" offset="1910575">This was done and Officer Beckmann now observed that it appeared to be a white contra -- a contraceptive containing a white powder.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.561" offset="1949654">So that this is the first point, according to the original version of which Officer Beckmann even had occasion to examine the object at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.264" offset="1980479">In the federal court, he adds an additional fact somewhat contradicting his original story.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.525" offset="2013497">Now, he testifies that before the defendant alighted from the cab, Beckmann momentarily flashed his light on the object and observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.693" offset="2046098">It appeared to be a contraceptive with some sort of light colored object in it, although, here again, he acknowledged that he didn't really recognize the nature of the object as resembling a powder-like narcotic until after it was handed to him by Officer Grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.373" offset="2120913">At that point, the arrest was not only made in fact but Officer Beckmann had previously told the defendant “You're under arrest,” and grabbed him by the arm.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.136" offset="2155917">He then, as I say, examined the object with the view to ascertaining its contents and noted apparently for the first time which he had not truly to do so that it appeared to contain some sort of a white powder which later investigation proved to contain heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.186" offset="2228120">Now, Officer Beckmann, and I -- and I bring this up merely, because in light of the contradictory stories the officer told, his attitude toward the defendant may bear some irrelevance here, then proceeded to pursue the defendant into an alley where he was subdued -- where he subdued the defendant by stopping him and according to his testimony shooting him in the back apparently and beating him with what he referred to as a sap or a blackjack.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.549" offset="2333550">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="593.916" offset="2479000">He said that he stopped the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1024.608" offset="4201827">And the trial judges views in that regard, I think, are reflected in the fact that when we endeavored to cross-examine Officer Beckmann as to any general patterns of cooperation, which the Court on its own motion objected to the line of questioning stating that the only thing pertinent as far as cooperation under silver platter is concerned, was cooperation on the particular case involved, and we question the soundness of that even under the silver platter doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1101.497" offset="4509341">We stated that without waiving our rights in that regard, we would now proceed to try the illegality of the search and therefore, we present it in evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1719.512" offset="6981465">We think that certainly, determining whether the evidence was seized with or without probable cause which both the states and federal governments with practical unanimity apply as the test of a lawful search and seizure is one that lies at the crux of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.173" offset="7048025">Now, in that regard, we believe that this case presents facts which lie outside the periphery of the area of permissible search and seizure as this Court described the facts in Brinegar and in the Carroll case, because in those cases, the facts involved a driver and a vehicle recognized as having been lately involved in unlawful operations, whereas in the present case, the -- and also was heading for a probable illegal market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.362" offset="7180831">In the present case, the police testified they had no idea as to who this defendant was or what the taxi cab was and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.434" offset="7205073">In other words, it's not surprising the Government concedes a lack of probable cause at the outset of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.948" offset="7231195">Now, we submit that events that occurred later in the course of the transaction cannot validate an enterprise embarked on according to the police to see if defendant had narcotics in his possession, cannot validate an enterprise unlawful from its beginning and further that even at the time the police made their formal arrest of the defendant, even after they'd grabbed him, Officer Beckmann had reached them and grabbed defendant by the arm and so forth, even then there was no probable cause because it wasn't till the defendant had alighted from the taxi cab and been placed under formal arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.650" offset="7369958">Not only under a -- an arrest in fact similar to that in the Henry case recently decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.736" offset="7398275">It wasn't until then that the police first really made any real observation of this object and then determined that it appeared to be a container of a narcotic powder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.077" offset="7439653">And we submit at that point certainly the police could not justify the prior course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.017" offset="7471417">In other words, while the transaction was unlawful from its inception and the search and seizure began at an earlier point, we submit probable cause doesn't come into the picture until a much later time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.741" offset="7518333">Certainly, Officer Beckmann's later suggestion that he flashed his light on the object and momentarily viewed it while defendant was still in the cab which is certainly in about face from his original state court testimony which the Government vouched for and entered in and stipulated to introduction of in the federal court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.369" offset="7604851">We don't think that an officer should be able to justify conduct in a probable cause theory on any such flimsy ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="2372.936" offset="9595068">-- except the fact that the evidence, when turned over by Officer Beckmann, was being used, prior to that time, there was no participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.685" offset="9630072">Now -- but it is our position, and getting back to the some of the questions previously posed that even in the absence of participation, the federal court, either on constitutional ground, which I've already mentioned or on the basis of the McNabb approach, in the exercise with supervisory over -- powers over the federal courts, should not say granted this evidence was seized without probable cause, granted if it had been seized by federal officers that we would reject it, granted that we believe that with the state sanctions unlawful searches and seizures, it is acting in derogation of the Fourteenth Amendment and granted that the states in an effort to preclude unlawful searches and seizures has attempted to exclude this evidence and to discipline its officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.822" offset="9838634">Nevertheless, we feel that if the officer comes into the federal court in such a situation, we will permit him to introduce this evidence in a federal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.197" offset="9892133">Now, I might say at that point that the exclusionary rule of the state courts is a matter which can't be ignored by this Court because assuming the Court is merely can deal with the problem as one in the exercise of its supervisory powers in fashioning a rule in the exercise of those powers, can the Court properly disregard the fact that 21 of the states in which the rule is going to be applied, 21 or almost half of the states now follow the Weeks rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.107" offset="10003832">And in those states, the disciplinary effect of the state rule will be seriously undermined if the state officers need only do what Officer Beckmann did here and cross the state -- the street to the federal courthouse, nor can it be said that, as was indicated in the Wolf opinion, that proper respect is being given to the state judicial processes and the rights of the state to choose their methods when California finds the only means it has to exclude unlawfully seized evidence, or I should say to deter unlawful searches and seizures, is to exclude evidence unlawfully seized as well explained by Justice Traynor in the Cahan case and the courts nevertheless state that where the state attempts to invoke the exclusionary rule, a federal court will lend its aid to such an undertaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.937" offset="10215111">And I might say there is another aspect of the problem in shaping the rule that bears consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.911" offset="10235068">And that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.133" offset="10239875">This isn't simply a case of bungling by state officers which embarrasses a federal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.272" offset="10276446">Not only was this a prosecution which was first called to the attention of the federal authorities by the very state officers who made the unlawful search and seizure, but this is a case where, assuming our contention as to the facts to be correct, there was a search and seizure without probable cause in violation of constitutional standards laid down by this Court as well as by the California courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.587" offset="10377697">Now, such a search and seizure, we submit, doesn't involve mere bungling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.194" offset="10400162">It involves an invasion of constitutional rights which should be deterred and while it maybe that an individual in a given case would go free if the exclusionary rule is invoked in such a case, and the same course is true in a federal prosecution where federal officers are involved, we submit that whereas -- certainly where the states have gradually been determining that the only effective means of enforcing the constitutional guarantee is to exclude the evidence, that the federal courts should not say, well, we believe that where state officers were involved in spite of the fact the states may feel the contrary, the need to convict the defendant outlays the need to deter invasions of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.525" offset="10597439">And so we submit that this isn't the case of mere technical or minor violations but one of very serious violations of rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="3302.148" offset="13311979">And I want to lay at rest in the idea that the officer had a third hand with a gun in his hand at this moment because it was admitted by the petitioner below on page 23 when the petitioner in argument, not this counsel here contended, he approached his gun in one hand, his badge in the other, as I understand it.</text>
