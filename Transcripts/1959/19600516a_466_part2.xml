            <text syncTime="246.910" offset="1091062">But then, it went into consideration of the merits of the case and it discussed in detail the fact that there was no request made for appointment of counsel at the trial that the case was one which fell within the line of -- of cases cited by this Court, the Betts and Brady.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.272" offset="1180505">It was a long discussion on the merits of the complaint made.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.525" offset="1201507">So, as I see it, the North Carolina Court, in the Cruse case very definitely decided that in a post-conviction hearing, the -- an allegation of denial of right to counsel could be heard and determined on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.599" offset="1341733">And the -- the statute says if the petitioners without counsel and alleges in the petition that he is without means of any natures sufficient to procure a counsel, he shall state whether or not he wishes counsel to be appointed to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.382" offset="1404949">If appointment of counsel is so requested, the Court shall appoint counsel if satisfied that petitioner has no means sufficient to procure counsel.</text>
