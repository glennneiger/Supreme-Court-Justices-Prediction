            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="24.498" offset="201331">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.245" offset="224319">This action involves the right of the New York Power Authority to take the lands of the Tuscarora Indian reservation to carry out a project licensed by the Federal Power Commission in connection with the Niagara River Development.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.201" offset="344168">In order to fully understand the problems that had to be dealt with by the Commission and the courts below, we have to turn back shortly to the situation as it was before 1950, when the treaty involved in this development was executed between the parties, Canada and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.766" offset="450435">At that -- under the old agreements between the two countries, the provision was that Canada should -- should have the right to use 36,000 cubic feet per second for hydroelectric power and the United States, 20,000 cubic feet per second for such development.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.534" offset="537475">This gave Canada a very distinct advantage and the United States was eager to have a -- an equal share in the waters of the Niagara River for hydroelectric purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.839" offset="602676">So that a new treaty was negotiated and finally executed in 1950, which provided that each country would have an equal share of the waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.153" offset="643950">But it also specifically provided for protection of the scenic attractions in the Niagara Falls area and required that a certain number of cubic feet per second be released during certain hours of the day running from morning until -- rather, early evening during the tourist season and a reduction during the month of October to a slightly lower amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.332" offset="772681">The Niagara Mohawk Power Company, a private power development had a Schoellkopf works so called, on the river which was using the power under the old agreement, and also, it was called the Adams works which was largely obsolete.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.118" offset="859826">And they had been draw -- having the use of the project waters prior to the controversy involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.378" offset="900890">From 1950 to 1957, the United -- the Congress was unable to arrive at any agreement to develop the United States' share of this water, because of many conflicts that developed in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.473" offset="973302">One of the principle ones was the issue whether it would be done by private power or public power interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.595" offset="1001723">And that controversy flared for those -- practically that entire period.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.979" offset="1027323">It was also the question of whether there would be a preference for cooperatives and municipalities which is not provided for under the Federal Power Act, and whether adjacent States would be able to get a share of this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.335" offset="1088763">Finally, the Schoellkopf works that were operated by the private power interest, Niagara Mohawk, fell into the river in 1956, in the middle of a summer and that precipitated actions so that the Congress was able to resolve the whole thing very rapidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.739" offset="1174340">And they passed what is known as a Public Law 85-159.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.139" offset="1199940">Now, this law was different than many of the acts of the Congress in this area, because in it, Congress deliberately and carefully tried to resolve the great issues that had been troubling both sides of the controversy's purport.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.417" offset="1273083">And it first prescribed in definite terms that the New York Power Authority would develop this power and which should be -- should receive a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.957" offset="1323238">It also provided that the license should be granted under that Act, 85-159, and not the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.514" offset="1369422">It provided that there would be a preference as to the power for the municipalities and cooperatives of 50% of all of the power that was developed in the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.794" offset="1422503">And that 20% of that 50% would be made available to adjacent States that is -- it was contemplated and were not spelled out to Ohio and Pennsylvania.</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="341.945" offset="1471195">(Inaudible), do you say that Congress directed the issue to be licensed under 1957 Act to be granted then by the Federal Power Commission?</text>

            <text syncTime="352.558" offset="1513618">It said so in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.498" offset="1525321">It also says that the grant shall be made by conforming to the rules and regulations of the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.470" offset="1585298">But, if there should be any conflict between the two, that conflict should be resolved by the superseding of the new law, the 85-159, over the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.813" offset="1650604">And that is in expressed terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.407" offset="1656978">I think you might wish to turn to that on page 79 of the Government's brief, Federal Power Commission, Section 2 at the bottom of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.105" offset="1703790">The license issued under the terms of this Act shall be granted in conformance with Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.195" offset="1744123">Now, that is in -- in conformance with that law to see it distinguishes between the law and the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.830" offset="1790725">But in the event of any conflict, the provisions of this Act shall govern in respect with the project herein authorized.</text>

            <text syncTime="440.834" offset="1866689">But in the event -- but in the event of any conflict, from what you tell us, this is intended to preclude reference to the general Power Act if there'll be a conflict between that and this specific statute, is that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="461.869" offset="1950804">But I think the language itself is open to the interpretation that if there is any conflict with regard to the Federal Power -- Federal Rules -- or Federal Power Commission's Rules of the Practice and Procedure that that conflict shall be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.061" offset="2015587">And then the Act itself says that this grant shall be under this particular Act, so it defines exactly what the nature of this grant shall be.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.145" offset="2131989">But that would be by implication but -- but if you call attention to the fact that Section 2 refers to a conflict, and I was just wondering whether the conflict referred to is not the conflict between this Act and Rules of Practice rather than conflict between this Act and the original Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="527.461" offset="2213177">Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I think that the Act in its nature in the fact that it took seven years developing it, tried to resolve that this Act would control any conflicts with any legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="635.519" offset="2645452">Now, there was a further provision to take care of this Schoellkopf Plant and the private power development there, the Niagara Mohawk, that they will be forming 45,000 kilowatts that would be supplied to Niagara Mohawk and that they should try to see that the industrial developments had been relying upon this low cost power would get that power at the rates -- low rates that they had previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.462" offset="2753181">And that the rates would be regulated by the Power Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.935" offset="2783065">They would have the right to build transmission lines to the various places that they sold the power and that the rates for the power on resale should be the lowest reasonable rates that they could obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.904" offset="2859029">In presenting this to the Congress over the seven-year period, the reservoir was -- generally was throughout the period located at the same point as is now in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.484" offset="2917334">But due to this -- the difference, the change brought about by the Schoellkopf disaster in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.921" offset="2951084">The share of the Power Authority of the water had to be increased and therefore, the reservoir in order to use all of the share of the United States of the water from Niagara River.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.977" offset="3011271">The Act itself is explicit in that the Power Commission's license should provide and print it, so that the Power Authority, in this license, should use all, and I emphasize “all”, of the share of the United States of the water of the Niagara River.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.130" offset="3111894">Congress was explicit that the plants that were developed and the license would use every drop of this water that was the United States' share.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.645" offset="3157974">And that is, it's particularly clear in this case because prior to that time, all it got through the law, it contemplated that Niagara Mohawk would get enough of the water to handle the same share of the power development that it had done as a private development before.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.330" offset="3240730">But with the disaster of falling into the river, they decided to turn it all over to the public Power Authority of New York and that it should use all of the water that was the United States' share.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.671" offset="3294020">Now, mere presentations of how this would be done, they -- they have the benefit of the Bureau of Power or the Federal Power Authority back in 1949 in which it developed how this should be done and located the reservoir at the same general point, recommending a 22,000 acre-foot -- acre-feet reservoir at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.353" offset="3388792">And then they referred it to the Corps of Engineers for its recommendation and the Corps of Engineers came up with a 30,000 acre-foot reservoir at the same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.389" offset="3436962">And then, the New York Power Authority, before the Schoellkopf disaster and they were given the additional water, recommended one of 41,000 acre-feet at the same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.120" offset="3487848">Now, it was clearly the Congress, throughout this whole period when these committees met time after time in regard to this matter and studied the project that there had to be a pump-generating reservoir and pump-generating plant in order use these waters properly, because there are -- when the peak demand is during the daylight hours through the week and over the weekend and during the night time hours, there isn't a demand for the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.449" offset="3621177">So, in order to get the benefit for the people of the country in that area of the greatest production of power possible, they devised the -- and all these -- there is no controversy between the engineers as to doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.356" offset="3680841">There was a general agreement by all of them that presented anything, that this was the way to take the greatest advantage of this water development on the Niagara River and produce the most power for the benefit of the people in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.126" offset="3743848">Now, this is the Niagara River and this is the fall, and this is the Schoellkopf Plant that fell into the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.264" offset="3788466">And here is the water intake.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.513" offset="3801422">That's where they take out of the river down this conduit near the railroad yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.531" offset="3829530">We'll come into the controversy later down here along the conduit, and here is the proposed reservoir.</text>

            <text syncTime="1157.205" offset="4732217">So, that they did examine very carefully the various possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.239" offset="4752280">They also considered a plan that came down here in this slope area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.850" offset="4770774">When they get down here in the slope area, that is considerably lower and some of that would be discharged, because the whole series of pump-generating reservoir is that you pump it up on an elevation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.534" offset="4821556">And then you use gravity to let it flow down through the generators and produce the electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.981" offset="4847261">And when you get down here on some of these slope, it's down at a level where it doesn't contribute anything to the fall or the header -- hydro when electric engineers speak of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.436" offset="4893132">And therefore, it gets no benefit of that and it's just as though you had so much level ground there that if you'd pour the water on, you try to hold it there, and then you have to get to head from the rest of the water, so that you lose all of the benefit of that water as far as producing electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.546" offset="5005563">Now, the Commission also concluded that it was necessary to have 60,000 acre-feet of reservoir in order to fully use the United States' share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.614" offset="5057808">And that determination was made by them after this exhaustive hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.130" offset="5107858">Now, the question probably occurs to the Court as to whether or not the Congress had brought to its attention in explicit terms whether this would take the Tuscarora Reservation lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="3872.785" offset="15594559">First, I would like to ask you two or three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.693" offset="15602186">Mr. Justice Harlan's first question, I answer equivocally -- unequivocally about it, no, the need for this land does not come about since the license is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.055" offset="15639594">The need for this land does not come about as a result of anything that's occurring through the Congress' action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.240" offset="15660283">That's number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.329" offset="15664671">Number two, Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked when the need for the land was ascertained and publicized really.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.493" offset="15701347">The need for the land came about as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.044" offset="15711587">The Schoellkpf Plant fell in the river in -- on June 8 I think it was 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.897" offset="15734993">There were Congress -- hearing from the House shortly thereafter but -- but pretty much beside the point except that it was testimony there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.868" offset="15762892">Now, where it was pointed out at those hearings, in the summer in 1946, the prior plan for the whole project had to be scrapped and increased in size.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.125" offset="15799881">And then, the record shows that in the fall of 1956, the Power Authority made a brand new study and as the result of the brand new study ascertained that in order to use all the waters of the river available to the United States a 60,000 acre-foot reservoir was needed and that Indian land was needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.560" offset="15881592">As a result of that study in 1956, a -- a report including a map was brought out and that's the exhibit 191 of the -- which the Solicitor General has been talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.680" offset="15930075">But what I want to make clear is that that map, that exhibit was before Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="4117.970" offset="16575300">That is that Congress, now when it set this law on 1957, I think you could assume -- I think you've got a right to assume, it knew that New York State throughout its history, now, this is no State right to arguing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.919" offset="16627022">But the New York State throughout its history had been condemning Indian lands and its waters for public purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.455" offset="16653145">It has done that since the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.590" offset="16661713">And, as a matter of fact, there's testimony in the record that New York claimed to have the right to condemn all the lands in the forest, and I am talking about Indians not necessary for the power, private.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.573" offset="16705703">I think you have to consider that, and that there's a cabinet consent by Congress throughout the years to New York exercising the power in its domain over Indian lands, and it's done it all through the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.042" offset="16747499">Now I think that you have to consider that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.683" offset="16754082">Now, two more things, and I'll set down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.956" offset="16763173">One is there's no question of fairness in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4168.618" offset="16777801">The Solicitor General said, the offer was $2,400,000 actually it got up to $3,000,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="4214.771" offset="16962435">And incidently sir, this is not only purchased land, but this land has enjoyed a tax abatement as a result of a statute passed on New York State, not by Congress, in 1821 and regarding to this -- and this has always been, and I'm not arguing State rights again now either.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.170" offset="17024084">But regarding to these Indians, it's always been in the State of New York and it has never been in the Government of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="4239.886" offset="17062954">New York educates them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.194" offset="17068178">New York provides doctors and nurses for them, schools on their reservation, everything that's done all through the years by New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.851" offset="17094823">And even back in Worcester against Georgia, the Court was probably said Georgia had no rights over Indians at all, it did indicate that there was a difference in the -- of the United States from what the situation was in Georgia because of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.890" offset="17142888">But I -- I do think you have to keep that in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.384" offset="17148949">And one other thing sure is this, and that is the Power Authority presents very strong in the argument that the litigation in the Second Circuit as defined on this Court of Appeals below, it should have been honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.015" offset="17203388">Now, in this case, we -- the -- the first part was pointed out by Solicitor General, the order which is under review here did not include Indian land in the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.078" offset="17243721">The Court -- the Commission refused to pass on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.854" offset="17254797">The Commission -- and so that -- so we maintain that the -- that the respondent was not agreed as a result of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.272" offset="17288443">But in any event, right after rehearing was denied on that order, the respondents started a declaratory judgment and the injunction action in New York State before the Court below got jurisdiction by the filing with it of the Commission's transcript of judgment -- transcript to the record, there was actually a judgment in the -- declaratory judgment injunction action affirmed as modified by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4318.978" offset="17379244">Now, I do point out to you sirs that in this -- in respondent's brief, respondent says, it concedes in fact, that if the 4 (e) finding is not necessary, the 4 (e) did not apply, then, the Court of Appeals' judgment is binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.304" offset="17432639">You'll find that I think on page 84.</text>
            <text syncTime="4334.419" offset="17440998">Court of Appeals -- there's a judgment of the Second Circuit Court that is binding.</text>

            <text syncTime="4555.500" offset="18325400">Respondent's position in essence is that there is no such consent stating of Indian tribal lands either in the 1957 statute authorizing the project or in the Federal Power Act or in any combination of these two laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="4612.416" offset="18553083">Now, it must be either expressly in that statute to conform with the rule of Elk against Wilkins, the general acts don't apply to Indians unless clearly manifested by Congress or we must find, as the Court of Appeals in this District of Columbia Circuit found in Seneca Nation against Brucker that the legislative history of the Act is so clear that Congress intended to take Indian lands that we can find a congressional consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.152" offset="18687979">That is, again, to restate it that the interest of the United States in Indian lands combined with the guardianship interest of the United States, is of such a nature that we must spell out a repeal at the protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.994" offset="18751300">We can't find it, I might add, by implication and I will get to it a little later into my -- in my argument and to just why the authority cited by the Government in this case in making its argument on consent by implication just don't stand up on this group.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.749" offset="18814412">But, there has to be something affirmative by Congress before the -- we can find the authority for the taking of Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.007" offset="18859447">Now, before getting into the main point of my argument, I would like to take up two matters where I feel that the argument by petitioners has been misleading.</text>

            <text syncTime="5210.623" offset="20945899">All I'm trying to say is that this statute on its face did not supersede Section 4 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="5216.967" offset="20971290">And it didn't do it on it's face, it didn't do it in the Committee report, and I believe I have here the Federal Power Commission's own report on the legislation in which they point out that directing the issuance of a license to a -- to a particular licensee is a unique way for Congress to act, because generally, this is left up to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5244.165" offset="21080064">And I'm reading now from the hearings on these bills in 1957 before the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5251.750" offset="21110366">This is April 10th, 1957 and I'm reading at page 7, the Power Commission's own report on this legislation where it says, “Congress -- Congress may exercise its unquestioned prerogative of selecting the licensee by direct legislative enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5270.546" offset="21185599">Moreover, the bill properly recognizes the fundamental safeguards to the public interest embodied in the Power Act, and that the Commission must consider the Power Authority's plan of development and prescribe whatever license terms and conditions it deems necessary to effectuate the provisions of the power.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5291.948" offset="21271176">Now, what I say is that this is a clear indication that Section 4 (e) is preserved by this 1957 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.035" offset="21307538">Now, in their arguments to that, the Solicitor General and counsel for the Power Authority of the State of New York, both have emphasized to the Court not the prime issue in the case that of legislative consent, but rather the physical signs and importance of the Niagara project.</text>
            <text syncTime="5321.354" offset="21388831">Now, the major theme seems to be that this vast project, and I will concede right here and now that it's very great undertaking, simply cannot be constructed to plan capacity without using Tuscarora lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.201" offset="21452152">And from this premise, they conclude that Tuscarora lands, as a matter of necessity, must be subject to condemnation to be used in the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="5347.942" offset="21495097">Now, I submit Your Honors that this argument is being made in the wrong Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.363" offset="21516831">That whether the alleged necessity to take Tuscarora lands actually justifies a taking is a matter for Congress to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="5364.631" offset="21561866">As the Court and its questions recognized that a portion of the reservation is -- in effect, is essential to full development of the Niagara River.</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.271" offset="21604498">Petitioners could and they still can go to Congress, and Congress, in turn, has the undoubted right to sanction the condemnation of a portion of the Tuscarora Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5386.292" offset="21648488">We don't dispute that one bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.887" offset="21658937">But having failed to go to Congress and getting legislative treaty, petitioners may not now seek to substitute an alleged need to require respondent's land for the necessary legislative consent, the taking of those lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="5405.894" offset="21726960">And I would like to point out with the -- as it is pointed out in Footnote 5 of my brief, that when we were discussing settlement, and this is a matter which actually is extraneous to the legal principles in the case, that the fact to the matter is that the settlement negotiations broke down for the very simple reason that the chairman of the Power Authority wrote to me saying, “We will not make any settlement contingent upon Federal Legislation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5436.571" offset="21849631">And the ground expressed in the letter was, we have to know the exact dimensions of the reservoir by March of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="5445.171" offset="21884008">And here, it is December of 1959 and we're still litigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="5450.796" offset="21906578">Now, getting over to the basic issue in this case that of legislative consent, I would like to touch very briefly upon a few general principles of law which have guided our dealings with Indian tribes for 175 years in which I feel are basic to resolution and understanding of the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.243" offset="22004381">That is as the Court has recognized by its question, much of petitioners would like to ignore the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.707" offset="22034160">Respondent is an Indian tribe and respondent's lands are an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5487.911" offset="22055058">And the relationships of the parties in this case are not the same as they would be if non-Indians were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5496.667" offset="22090062">Now, I think I can state the general proposition very simply in this way that Tuscarora lands are subject to federal prohibitions against alienation without the consent of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5513.296" offset="22156518">And in view of this prohibition against alienation, the expressed consent of the United State is necessary if Indian lands are to be taken or otherwise acquired.</text>

            <text syncTime="5588.237" offset="22456299">But in every other situation, these -- Congress had specifically provided either in the general authority that's 25 United States Code 357, the general authority to condemn a lot of Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="5605.113" offset="22523800">Or, there is a 1926 statute which authorizes condemnation in several Indian lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="5852.599" offset="23513736">We can find it in the Federal Power Act only in Sections 3 (2) and in 4 (e) and in 10 (e) which deal with Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="5861.204" offset="23548217">We cannot find it in Section 21 which is merely a general authority to condemn.</text>
            <text syncTime="5866.497" offset="23569324">Now, if the Court says that Sections 4 (e), and therefore Section 3 (2) and Section 10 (e), don't apply to the Tuscarora Reservation, then, we have no consent when we can't bring the Tuscarora under the Federal Power Act because as the language in three sections which deals with Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5889.365" offset="23660857">And then turn right around and say that these three sections don't apply to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5894.018" offset="23679457">What we have to do with respect to the Federal Power Act, if we find consent in the Federal Power Act, we must bring Tuscarora lands wholly under the Act and give the Tuscarora as the benefit of all of the provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5908.772" offset="23738493">But, if we find that 4 (e) doesn't apply, then we are thrown back upon the general restriction on alienation 177 and 233 of the Title 25.</text>
