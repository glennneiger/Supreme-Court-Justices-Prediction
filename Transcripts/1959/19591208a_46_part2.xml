            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- (Inaudible) next to the (Inaudible) in which it ruled that it would not order discovery in the absence of a formal charge of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.450" offset="213138">Having been told that, the Board undertook further investigation to the extent that this was possible without access to the books and records and testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.554" offset="269563">And it formulated a rather detailed contempt petition which appears at Record 3 to 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.118" offset="311881">That petition for contempt is directed not only against Deena Artware, the company involved in the original unfair labor practice, but also against the parent company, Deena Products against various other subsidiaries of Deena Products to which Deena Artware's assets were ultimately transferred and against George Weiner, the President of all of these corporations and the controlling stockholder of the parent company.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.293" offset="472586">This contempt petition, filed in August of 1958, was accompanied by a renewed motion for discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.931" offset="511143">The Court's final decision of December 1958 dismissed the contempt petition and denied the motion for discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.152" offset="559940">It's that judgment, of course, that's under review here.</text>

            <text syncTime="123.534" offset="597556">And the Court's opinion says that the 1952 decree of the Court enforcing the Board's original order was not sufficiently definite so far as restitution of back pay was concerned to support a contempt adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.017" offset="695463">The reason the Court says is that the 19 -- the early -- original Board order left undetermined the exact amounts due each employee, merely ordered that each one of them be made whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.364" offset="752828">Then the Court goes on to say that accordingly, there was no binding decree until the 1955 order of the Court which enforced the Board's supplemental decision position, but reasons the Court, between 1952 and 1955, Deena Artware, on the Board's own allegations, had completed the process with making itself judgment proof and after 1955 was unable to pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="216.047" offset="967555">Thus it seems to us, we've come full circle in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.362" offset="988871">The Board having first been told in 1953 when it diligently came in and sought to enjoin a partial assignment of assets that it was premature, and that it could always come back after the back pay obligation was liquidated if, in the meantime, Deena Artware had purposefully stripped itself of its assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.414" offset="1089076">It's told ultimately when it does come back with the petition for contempt on that very basis that at last it is now too late.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.638" offset="1281964">If at that time any financial inability to pay the award as shown to be the result of improper actions on its part in the meantime appropriate contempt action can then be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.806" offset="1350614">Our -- our position in relation to the Court of Appeals' latest opinion can be summed up very simply, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.564" offset="1393664">We agree with the Court of Appeals that its 1952 decree, directing the company to make restitution to the named employees did not impose a present obligation to pay specific sums.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.270" offset="1468479">Certainly, it was contemplated that the Board, in accordance with its usual practice, would exercise its continuing jurisdiction and that it would conduct such supplemental proceedings as might be necessary failing agreements between the parties to determine the exact amounts due.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.509" offset="2637406">That is correct and I think perhaps to make this perfectly clear, it might be best at this point for me to summarize briefly the allegations in the Board's contempt petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.493" offset="2681396">The Board alleges that there has been a concert of action by Weiner, the President and controlling stockholder, by Deena Products, the parent company and by the various subsidiaries including Deena Artware for the purpose of frustrating the satisfaction of this back pay obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.769" offset="2774497">The petition recites that the parent corporation has provided each of the subsidiaries with raw materials and supplies and that it has also fixed the prices at which the subsidiaries would sell their output back to the parent company.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.778" offset="2846490">The parent has kept the books and records for all of the subsidiaries, has commingled the funds and property of the various corporations and has managed them as divisions or departments of a single enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.384" offset="2908871">It is alleged further that following the institution of the original Board proceeding, the unfair labor practice case, Artware was compelled by the parent company products to buy dear and sell cheap.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.821" offset="2966653">So that it would show losses from the operations and products which show substantial profits from those same operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.642" offset="2997896">It is further alleged that various charges were made on the books against Deena Artware, which, under normal and proper accounting practice, should have been made against other of the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.871" offset="3050872">It is alleged further that shortly after this Court denied certiorari in the unfair labor practice case, Products and Weiner caused Artware to cease operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.635" offset="3101863">That was followed promptly according to the Board's allegations by the transfer of Artware's plant, property and assets to Products ostensibly in satisfaction of notes and other obligations which the Board says were fictitious.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.057" offset="3179604">The plant and the physical facilities were then in turn assigned to other subsidiaries of Products and operated thereafter as they still are operated today as a part of this family of enterprises but under different corporate names.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.713" offset="3258180">All of the relevant transfers and assignments of assets and property, according to the allegations, took place between 1952 when the first decree was ordered enforced and 1955 when the Court entered its second decree affirming the Board's supplemental decision and all of the respondents, it is alleged, acted with full knowledge of the relevant orders of the Board and decrees of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.618" offset="3401853">And thus, we say we are brought back to what seems to us to be the crucial question, namely, whether the equity decree entered in 1952 ordering Deena Artware its successors, assigns and officers to pay back pay whether that merely created an abstract determination of no binding of fact at all or whether particular consequences attached immediately to that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.585" offset="3553677">Now, there's no question, I take it, that we have here an in personam equity decree directing a party to do something, in this case, to make restitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="876.064" offset="3607594">At that point, there's no question that they could not have made the payments because they didn't know the exact amount that would be involved and their entire argument is predicated upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.060" offset="3655659">Now, what we challenge is the contention that an order to make restitution imposes no restraint an equity court order to make restitution imposes no restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.842" offset="3710725">We say that it does impose a restraint before the amount is liquidated in dollars and cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.662" offset="3746043">Suppose, for example, that a bankruptcy court were to order a bankrupt to turn our assets to a trustee, I take it, that that would be a binding obligation before there were any accounting or inventory to determine just how much property there was and before it was determined how much of it was statutory exempt property and how much nonexempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.238" offset="3848338">We think this is a similar situation in that the equity decree imposes at once an obligation to refrain from frustrating the manifest purpose of the order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1079.674" offset="4422092">Yes, and I assume that there were a good many problems in this case where it would not have taken us so long.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.697" offset="4454170">Perhaps an -- an example which is even closer than the bankruptcy example I just gave is this Court's decision in McComb against Jacksonville Paper, and I have in mind the second Jacksonville Paper case, the civil contempt proceeding which is reported in 336 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.001" offset="4563362">The Court will recall that as a result of prior litigation in the first Jacksonville Paper case, litigation instituted by the wages and hours administrator, Jacksonville Paper had been enjoined substantially in the words of the statute from paying certain categories of employees less than they would be entitled to receive under the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.951" offset="4703169">The contempt case, the second phase of that litigation, was instituted on the ground that the company thereafter departed from the statute's minimum wage and overtime pay requirement and the prayer in that civil contempt proceeding was that the company be required to terminate its continuing violations and to purge itself of the contempt by paying the amounts of unpaid wages due the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.083" offset="4855724">Now, in that case, the company's argument made to this Court was that the original injunction very broadly required compliance with the statute, that it did not direct or prohibit any specific act such as the payment -- direction of payment of specific sums.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.674" offset="4954049">And that it was not sufficiently definite therefore to support a contempt citation especially the company argued where the District Court had found that the respondent was uncertain as to the application of the statute's requirements to the particular facts and had not willfully disobeyed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.455" offset="5049240">Now this Court nonetheless held in that case that the absence of willfulness did not relieve the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.483" offset="5089259">It sufficed the Court said that respondent there had taken a calculated risk and skirted close to the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.286" offset="5140564">The Court went on to say that it was no defense in that case, that the injunction merely incorporated the statutory formula for computing pay, but failed to set out the exact amounts which be -- would become due in particular context under a correct construction of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.129" offset="5231888">Now, we submit that if an injunction to pay employees in the future in accordance with the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act it's sufficiently definite to support a contempt citation even in the absence of willfulness as held in Jacksonville Paper, that the efficacy of this 1952 decree cannot be seriously questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.000" offset="5347349">The decree here did not relate to the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.534" offset="5365530">It did not involve variant or changing factual situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.362" offset="5392802">Its application couldn't possibly be regarded as uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.485" offset="5409311">It directed that 60 odd named persons be given back pay for a definite past period during which they had suffered the consequences of discharge and the decree, according to the Board's contempt petition, has been willfully violated throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.799" offset="5490604">Now, there's another aspect of the Jacksonville Paper case, which I'd like to mention here and it brings me to the last point that I would make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.841" offset="5538774">It was argued in Jacksonville Paper that the administrator was not authorized to bring a suit for compensation on the employees' behalf under the Fair Labor Standards Act, that the contempt procedure should not be used to reach that result indirectly, and that the employers -- the employees were fully entitled to bring a suit on their own to collect what was due them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.894" offset="5686941">In other words, it was argued that that injunction ought to be enforced by an independent proceeding and not by the Government agency involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.000" offset="5731349">Now, the Court rejected that argument, stating that the fact that another suit might be instituted to collect the payments was immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.244" offset="5776384">The Court said, "If the Court is powerless to require the prescribed payments to be made, it has lost the most effective sanction for its decree and a premium has been placed on violations."</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.291" offset="5856528">Now, I would suggest that the case for going forward with the contempt proceeding is more compelling in the -- in the instant situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.288" offset="5908564">The employees here have no remedy of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.576" offset="5929671">Under this statutory scheme, the Board has the exclusive authority to enforce the commands of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.888" offset="5978885">Moreover, the Board in awarding back pay and in taking steps to implement a back pay order is not as respondents would have it a mere collection agency to be analogized to a private creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.457" offset="6073240">This Court has said that the back pay remedy is one of the most important sanctions for effectuating the public policies of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.863" offset="6114826">We stress that this proceeding stems from a back pay order of the Board which the Court of Appeals has ordered enforced and we suggest that the Court of Appeals has the continuing and the inescapable responsibility to see to it that that decree of the Court is complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.098" offset="6211793">That, of course, was the position which was elaborated by Justice Stewart in his dissent at an earlier phase of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.159" offset="6252022">I should also like to point out that institution of proceedings in the Kentucky courts or in the District Court by way of the bill in equity to set aside transactions in fraud of creditors cannot be assumed to be an equivalent remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.095" offset="6335718">The power of the Court of Appeals to enforce its own decrees through it's equity authority is broad and it is flexible and the law fraudulent conveyancing of the States is certainly not notable for either of those attributes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2014.612" offset="8161782">Then the Court goes on and says that inability of a defense to a charge of contempt, civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.934" offset="8199084">Then on page 82, the Court goes on to consider the liability of the company in these terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.732" offset="8306291">It says acts prior to the entry of the order or judgment, referring now to the 1955 order, which he is charged with disobeying do not constitute contempt of court regardless of the intentions of the respondent to avoid the impact of an order or judgment expected by him to be thereafter entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.170" offset="8408064">And so the Court is saying that an order to make restitution unless it's liquidated in dollars and cents imposes no obligation and that in this case, when the order did become liquidated, the company had already dissipated the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3494.408" offset="14081024">Now, this -- this corporation, Deena Artware, was organized in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.976" offset="14115297">It had capital stock of no par value, and it was organized to buy a little pottery which it bought for $65,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.974" offset="14163257">It has been unsuccessful up to that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3521.234" offset="14188335">And the purpose of the purchaser was to use it for making lamp bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.247" offset="14212368">That was in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.073" offset="14227623">In the late Fall of 1947, I believe as late as December 1947, the respondent Deena Artware determined to enlarge its plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.442" offset="14301184">This has been attached to so many briefs that I feel like referring to it, Deena -- Judge Miller describes it in some detail in his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.074" offset="14335666">The plant was on the corner of 3rd and Ohio Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.175" offset="14356041">Behind the plant was about a half a block owned by Deena Artware.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.865" offset="14382791">There's a little warehouse on one end of it and it was the purpose of Deena Artware to construct another building there at a cost of about $80,000 so that the manufacturing process could be completed, an integrated operation right there in one block in this town and it would have conveyors going from the pottery plant to the plant where the finishing work was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.235" offset="14500342">That contract was made in December 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.469" offset="14525210">In the Spring of 1948, union negotiations began or rather the union began to get employees from the plant and finally, the Brick and Clay Workers Union was certified as a representative of the employees of Deena Artware.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.434" offset="14621132">Deena, by the way, is Weiner's wife's name in an ancient language and all of his businesses carry that name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.154" offset="14644015">I -- I hope it won't be considered as some evidence of integration or whatever they call it that they're all alter egos because they bear that name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.395" offset="14692916">Deena Artware carried on with the union negotiations until this kind of a difficulty arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.769" offset="14730428">On May 26, a meeting was to be held with a federal conciliator, Gus Ferguson, had an office in Cincinnati.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.306" offset="14772642">They would meet in my office and negotiate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.456" offset="14785181">At the last moment or few days before May 26, 1948, Ferguson wanted to change the date to May 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.945" offset="14819140">It was satisfactory to the employers' committee consisting of his manager and two people in the office and they said so, and Gus Ferguson, the conciliator, undertook to notify the union representative, a man named Bellew who lived in Olive Hill which is as far from Paducah as Olive Hill is from Washington, it's at the other end of the State, and he failed to notify Bellew, I don't know why, but at any rate, on May 26, he came to the office and learned that the meeting had been postponed until May 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.557" offset="14973576">Immediately with the few members of the union committee, he had a few words and they went on strike at 2 o'clock on 15 minutes notice, and 50 or 60 people walked out enough remained to operate the plant, but that was the cause and beginning of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.428" offset="15061034">It -- it was caused by the irritation and -- and childish peek for which one cannot blame them too much after that long trip of this man Bellew.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.488" offset="15105337">Well, a strike immediately brought on picketing and the -- the usual difficulties and the picket line was extended from the pottery plant on the corner so as to include the work where the new construction was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.132" offset="15183914">A car load of steel could not be unloaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.145" offset="15199901">The work couldn't progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.319" offset="15208678">It was a secondary boycott and was so held subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.351" offset="15232815">The discontinuance of that construction work made it necessary for Deena Artware or for Weiner, if you wish to put it that way, to do something to maintain his business contacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.833" offset="15314735">So the same plant and the steel and the material were taking down to Arlington in a nearby county, and a plant was put up there, and is still operating there, and that is Deena of Arlington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3817.319" offset="15372622">In the meantime, it bought for $25,000 a little plant at Whitlit, which is down on the Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.406" offset="15408985">The plant at Whitlit burned while this labor trouble was going on and was rebuilt and made into a modern plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.853" offset="15446810">This dispersal of operations was brought about not by Weiner or these affiliated companies, they were forced to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.977" offset="15503235">They wanted to have one operation at Paducah on one block so they could do it all there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.954" offset="15523192">They were compelled by this wrongful secondary boycott to move this plant to Arlington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.994" offset="15547329">And they did do the construction work at Arlington and they have now a useless foundation standing there for the cost of which they obtained a judgment against this union and the American Federation of Labor for about $30,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.243" offset="15608351">That, there was a hung jury on the first trial and on the second trial, that judgment was obtained in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.181" offset="15636146">In the meantime, the Labor Relations Board had gotten into the picture at a comparatively early date, and I don't know which came first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.761" offset="15686405">I believe -- but about the same time that the Court submitted to a jury the question of whether this was a secondary boycott and a judgment was rendered for Deena Artware.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.204" offset="15732172">The Labor Board representative held it was not a secondary boycott and that the union had done no wrong in that respect and issued its ruling against Deena Artware.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.301" offset="15780551">So that brings in to the point, I was going to answer Mr. Justice Harlan's question that when I was arguing this case and it came up July 30th, 1952, the two cases arrived on the same date and was set one after the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.902" offset="15842931">One of them, an appeal from the judgment of the United States District Court against this union, the American Federation of Labor on the grounds that it was a secondary boycott and the other, an appeal from the finding of the National Labor Relations Board based on the idea that it was not a secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.018" offset="15923493">And Judge Martin leaned over the bench and I'll never forget what he said because of the result that followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.361" offset="15948779">He said, “Brother Wheeler do you ever think we could affirm both those judgments on the ground there was substantial evidence to support both of them?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.339" offset="15980753">Well, I had to say that it was possible but I thought the result would be very undesirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.631" offset="16005935">I think it has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.060" offset="16011577">They were affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.335" offset="16016697">And the Court explained in the -- in the judgment affirming the damaged action that, of course, there was substantial evidence to support both rulings and it just affirmed them both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.180" offset="16068106">Well, the next step in this proceeding took place in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.945" offset="16091199">Deena Artware had a judgment and the judgment had been superseded by the deposit of some bonds by the unions with the clerk of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.512" offset="16149400">Deena Artware made an assignment of the judgment partly to my firm in payment for attorneys' fees for which we have a lien under the Kentucky law anyway and the balance to Deena Products Company as additional security for its indebtedness to Deena Products Company which was then secured by a mortgage executed October 31st, 1949, three years before this decree was rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.409" offset="16301014">The mortgage was thought to be insufficient to pay the indebtedness of Deena Artware to the parent company and so it assigned this judgment or a balance of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.817" offset="16350647">The Board contested that assignment and sought to have it set aside making allegations almost identical with those made here and seeking discovery remedies including the right to examine books and to take depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.956" offset="16431208">The court at that time, in the trial of that, I call it the 1953 case, it's the same case, made the statement that this is not a contempt proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.770" offset="16490454">I don't know why they made that statement in the opinion, but it wasn't -- not and it was commented on broadly in argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.319" offset="16520652">The Court pointed out and more than intimated in that hearing that there were proper remedies before a court of general jurisdiction and that the court could attack the wrongful conveyance or mortgaging of properties if it was wrongful because when we filed that assignment and the Board undertook to prevent the execution of the assignment, Deena Artware appeared before the United States Court of Appeals in forma pauperis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.015" offset="16667460">The Board knew then as they had known prior thereto that this little corporation had no assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.577" offset="16701628">It was obvious then in the 1953 case and the Court pointed out then that contempt was not the remedy, there were other remedies available to the Board if there had been any wrongful act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.631" offset="16789922">In April of that year, Deena Artware having theretofore employed these formal striking employees ceased to do business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4185.831" offset="16846660">It closed its doors on account of market conditions, all of which were well-known to the Board and it has never operated since.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.880" offset="16894934">In 1954, five years having elapsed since that mortgage was made to Deena Products Company, it conveyed its assets, all of them, to Deena Products Company in satisfaction of that indebtedness, and the indebtedness gratefully exceeded the value of their assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.266" offset="16992423">And there's no allegation to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="5936.353" offset="23848835">Most of -- most of that I go along with, but I do say that when in this series of statements shot through with conclusions of bad faith, they show that they knew that a mortgage was executed in 1939, three years before the first decree and six or seven years before the second decree that that fact is just as binding on them as these statements that they cite from the assets at a time when their own statement show there are no assets to siphon all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5964.900" offset="23962937">And they couldn't have done it, because they knew the facts and when it's taken as a whole, now, taking the -- the allegations afford to by the Chief Justice just set out taken out of context, it would appeal that they had made charges that he was -- that Weiner had or wrongfully controlled if -- all of these corporations.</text>

            <text syncTime="6005.705" offset="24126151">Now, in -- in conclusion, unless there's something further that Court may suggest to me, I want to say that Judge Miller had tried this controversy seven times, and I think Judge Martin was waiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="6023.982" offset="24199293">It's been up there before that Court so long that after the last one came up, one member of the Court said, “Well, we've gotten rid of old Deena at last”, but he was wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="6047.208" offset="24292185">And Judge Miller's final opinion from which this appeal is prosecuted is not only a review of facts, but we think a very thorough consideration of all of the issues before that Court and I refer to it because I know it will be studied by this Court as a more effective and more complete statement of facts from an impartial court than we could set out in our briefs up here.</text>

            <text syncTime="6086.065" offset="24447666">It seems to me that counsel has presented an entirely different version of the fact than I attempted to present.</text>
            <text syncTime="6094.880" offset="24482879">This results from the fact that counsel for respondent pleads the facts set out in the answer and we plead the facts set out in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6103.362" offset="24516838">That seems like fair play except to the fact that in the posture of the case, as it comes here, the allegations of the petition had to be taken as true.</text>
            <text syncTime="6111.277" offset="24548498">Now, for example, it has been stated time and again that the Government can't deny that this indebtedness reflected in a mortgage executed in 1949 had a legitimate basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.877" offset="24602833">Well, the Government does deny it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6127.638" offset="24613909">On page 11, the Government says in its petition, “Artware's alleged indebtedness,” I'm reading from paragraph (k), “to Products for which the notes, mortgage and assignments were executed was not a true and valid indebtedness and did not represent a true accounting of transactions between the companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6148.676" offset="24698128">It was not executed in the usual course of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6151.915" offset="24711084">It was made and executed for the purpose of the evading payment of the sums due under the decree, it was not for adequate and proper considerations for value given,” and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6163.208" offset="24756224">Now, it was that mortgage which was foreclosed in 1953 after the first decree has been executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6171.952" offset="24791228">Now, counsel refers time and again to the proposition you can't do this by contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="6178.212" offset="24816201">Well, I don't know how an equity court enforces its decrees when it's alleged that there has been a failure to comply with them except by the contempt process.</text>
            <text syncTime="6188.758" offset="24858415">And we're not asking for punishment, that word has been consistently used.</text>
            <text syncTime="6195.569" offset="24885687">We have been asking for the traditional remedy, the coercive remedy which equity can give to assure compliance with its decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="6205.737" offset="24926333">That means that contempt will be purged by the mere fact of payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6212.859" offset="24954859">Now, I did not mean to convey in my opening that we don't rely on the proposition that the transferees or assigns or successors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6221.999" offset="24991326">What I did mean to convey was that I did not want to posit the case in which these successors were purely innocent transferees.</text>
            <text syncTime="6231.135" offset="25027897">Because it seemed to me that the case was so much stronger on the allegations here which show that they're not innocent that the Court need not reach more difficult problems when it has to stand --</text>
