            <text syncTime="11.189" offset="148146">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.008" offset="179388">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.503" offset="201435">It is an action pursuant to Title 28 of the United States Code, Section 2410, about which the Court heard something in the argument of the Brosnan case yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.900" offset="254934">It is an action by The Bank of America, a National Bank, doing business in California against the United States to quiet title of the bank in and to certain land and chattels, specifically a sawmill and the equipment of it, in Calaveras County, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.034" offset="351483">The action was started in the Superior Court of the State of California as permitted by California law and was removed to Federal District Court on the motion of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.977" offset="395264">Both sides moved for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.945" offset="407176">The District Court granted the motion of the plaintiff bank, denied the motion of the defendant Government and decreed that the bank is the owner of the land, the buildings, and the equipment in question and that the Government is barred from asserting any adverse claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.752" offset="478333">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and this Court last October granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.417" offset="509053">The bank's title was acquired by purchase at a foreclosure sale held pursuant to a power sale of in a first deed of trust on the land and the power of sale in chattel mortgages on the personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.627" offset="577912">The Government was made a defendant because it holds tax liens against the former owner of the land and chattels and the Government claimed that its tax liens attached to the land and chattels and are still effective in spite of the fact that the taxpayer no longer held a free and unencumbered title to the land and chattels at the time when the tax lien attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.310" offset="692642">The deed of trust, and I may from this point on refer simply to the deed of trust without elaborating to include the chattel mortgage because I think the principles are the same on both types of documents, the deed of trust given in connection with the bank loan and the chattel mortgages had been executed by the taxpayer or a predecessor in title some time before the tax lien attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.187" offset="788146">Legal title to the real-estate was actually in the trustee under the deed of trust when the government acquired its tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.219" offset="828270">When the taxpayer defaulted in the payment of his indebtedness, the land and chattels were sold at public auction in accordance with the contract powers of sale and the bank became the purchaser at that sale at public auction.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.465" offset="893262">All notices required by California law were given, but these did not include in a special notice to the Government which had failed to request special notice as it might have done under California law.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.653" offset="1034010">Presumably with due diligence it would investigate the assets of the taxpayer to see what the means of collection might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.780" offset="1070477">It would discover that the property was subject to an outstanding lien and could then request the notice even though no default had occurred, in the event of default or in the event of sale and it would then receive the notice automatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.125" offset="1131917">Also these things are recorded in the public offices and there are any number of services and publications which most people subscribe to, which reveal them.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.370" offset="1532844">It is cited just below the middle of page three of our brief, its California Civil Code, Section 2924 (b), just at the end of the first full paragraph on page three of our main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.041" offset="1599509">The primary question presented to the Court is, does the purchaser of land and chattels that a foreclosure sale held pursuant to a power of sale and the first deed of trust and chattel mortgages, acquire title free of subordinate tax liens of the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="394.068" offset="1679653">There's no question about these liens being subordinate and then there is the secondary question, may such a purchaser establish his clear title by a quiet title suit against the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="409.579" offset="1741720">The Government has stated the question somewhat differently and I pause here momentarily to emphasize the correctness of the question as we have stated it because as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in the events in the Vanston Committee case in 329 United States, “putting the wrong questions is not likely to beget right answers even in law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="433.923" offset="1839104">The Government says that the question is whether a junior federal tax lien maybe extinguished through a non-judicial sale of the property by a mortgagee under a contractual power of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.222" offset="1904306">It is my view that there is no issue in this case about extinguishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.280" offset="1924472">No suit was brought to extinguish.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.190" offset="1936175">The statute, Section 3670 of the Internal Revenue Code, says that the Government's lien is, “Upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such person” that is the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.478" offset="2013288">In our view the taxpayer's right out or to which the Government lien attached was a defeasible right which subsequently dissolved or evaporated.</text>

            <text syncTime="514.214" offset="2160201">This suit assumes that the Government lien against the taxpayer is still just as valid as it ever was as to any property and rights to property belonging to the taxpayer.</text>

            <text syncTime="554.276" offset="2320488">The importance of the point is that you do not extinguish a general federal tax lien by this method because the tax lien is applicable to all property of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.885" offset="2366882">We're dealing here only with specific property and we say this specific property is no longer subject to the lien although the lien may still be in effect as to all the properties that the taxpayer may own.</text>

            <text syncTime="610.269" offset="2544410">Now, the same federal statutes are involved in this case as were involved in the Brosnan case, which was argued to Your Honors yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.896" offset="2578996">However, as this Court reaffirmed in the Best case in 357 United States, Section 3670 of the Internal Revenue Code creates no property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.036" offset="2635525">All it does is attach consequences to such right as are created under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.096" offset="2667708">I think it maybe worth a few moments without over emphasizing it therefore to discuss the nature of a deed of trust under California law, as well as to go into a little more detail about the alternative procedures that are available both to lienholders such as the bank and lienholders such as the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.164" offset="2776064">The clearest statement that I have found of the nature of a deed of trust in California is found in a 1933 case of the California Supreme Court entitled Bank of Italy against Bentley and I'd like to read just a sentence or two from that opinion which states it, I think quite clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.356" offset="2868746">The Court there said “Although this State, California, at an early date adopted the lien theory of mortgages, it adopted the title theory in reference to deeds of trust.”</text>
            <text syncTime="704.075" offset="2919633">In the early case of Koch against Briggs it was held that the mortgages and deeds of trust were fundamentally different in that, in a mortgage, only a lien was created while in a deed of trust, the title actually passed to the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.146" offset="2983999">This distinction although frequently attacked by counsel and often criticized by the courts has become well settled in our law and cannot now be disturbed.</text>

            <text syncTime="746.468" offset="3089220">The deed of trust given as here in connection with a bank loan conveys legal title to the trustee for the benefit of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.016" offset="3123388">It also contains the power of sale which authorizes the trustee to sell the real-estate in the event of the default.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.524" offset="3157452">Now the trustor borrower retains certain rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.306" offset="3172603">He retains the right to possession and he retains the right to reacquire the legal title, if he pays his debt when due.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.143" offset="3211995">And of course this bundle of rights has been called by various names, but I think there is no dispute that whatever you call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.159" offset="3248044">This bundle of rights retained by the trustor is -- is clearly not a free and unencumbered fee title.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.271" offset="3284407">The trustor-borrower cannot convey to any third party, any greater right than those he retains.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.053" offset="3311574">And if he has an attempt -- if he attempts to convey to a third party, X let's say, such a conveyance subtracts nothing from the rights of the trustee under the deed of trust and the power of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.157" offset="3371969">On default by trustee, may sell, free and unencumbered title, fee title and no one claiming under the trustor-borrower may attack that title of the purchaser at such a trustee sale and that's California property law, and there's no dispute about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.223" offset="3444276">It's been reaffirmed in the subsequent Carpenter against Small Claims Committe in the California Supreme Court which is cited in our brief and it was recently restated by the Federal Court in California, in the Northern District of California and the Higley case against the City of Sacramento cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.587" offset="3509687">One sentence there may be worth repeating.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.312" offset="3520658">The Federal Court said the “The general rule in California is that a sale by the trustee under the power of sale and the deed of trust has the effect of vesting the purchaser with title as of the date when the trust deed was executed”, which results in the extinguishment, if I may use the word extinguishment, results in the extinguishment of all liens on the property attaching subsequently to the trustee.</text>

            <text syncTime="885.117" offset="3643852">Not on the sale pursuant to a trust deed Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.689" offset="3662137">Now, yesterday inquiries were made in the course of the Brosnan argument as to state procedures which were available and how the Government might protect itself and I'm anticipating Your Honors' interest in similar questions as to California, I'd like to take a few moments just to outline those.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.771" offset="3738415">There are several loan alternatives, some of which maybe initiated by the Government and some by the holder of the deed of trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.973" offset="3775300">The first step as I said a moment ago is that the Government files notice of its tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.949" offset="3803199">Then exercising reasonable prudence presumably it investigates the taxpayer's assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.809" offset="3830575">I -- it's a matter of public record of which I assume this Court can take judicial notice that the Internal Revenue Service has a budget of $128,000,000 a year for tax audits and $18,000,000 a year for investigation of tax frauds and do special services and if this isn't enough to cover it they can get a title report for $25 which will show them the entire status of the -- of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.861" offset="3938826">So having determined this, if the taxpayer is shown to be trustor as this one was of a real-estate deed of trust, the Government records a simple request or notice of default and notice of sale in the event that there is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.554" offset="4005595">This may happen before default.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.586" offset="4017716">It will thereafter receive notice and be able to protect its interest by bidding it to public auction or by a suit if one should be indicated to enjoin any sale under of the power of sale, this is if the Government questions the validity of the deed of trust which of course it does not do in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.662" offset="4098069">Now, alternative, the Government may sue under section 7403 of Title 26 U.S. code which was mentioned yesterday to foreclose its lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.065" offset="4155643">That is to subject the taxpayer's property whatever it may be, whatever he's interest in property maybe to the payment of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.910" offset="4186990">It doesn't have to wait for action by the holder of the deed of trust; it can take this action itself or a third alternative, if it does not choose to follow either of those two, the Government may levy and (Inaudible) for taxes under Section 6331 in following of Title 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.224" offset="4264312">This is an administrative procedure which results in a sale of public auction at the instance of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.778" offset="4298480">So there are at least three methods which the Government may pursue to protect its rights or if it chooses not to do that, it may wait as it did here, for a prior action by the prior lienholder and in that event the holder of the deed of trust has at least three alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.447" offset="4401194">In the first place, he may request an administrative partial discharge of the Government lien from the property in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.160" offset="4444035">And this is normally accompanied by appraisals of value of the property showing the amount of the equity, if any, and offering to pay to the extent that any equity is shown, tells the -- this excess and then go through the normal procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.847" offset="4510804">And this I might say, it's not in the record but if Your Honors are interested in the practical procedures that are followed, this is what's normally done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.344" offset="4540792">This is one reason we don't have any more of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.935" offset="4551137">At least it's -- it's what the Bank of America normally does -- it does and I'm sure a great many others do the same thing and that this results in the -- in the disposition of a good many of the cases where this problem arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.466" offset="4609233">However, where this doesn't work, if there's a disagreement about values and or for some other reasons the Government doesn't choose to give it's administrative consent and of course it's free to do this, if there is no way of compelling it then the holder of the prior lien has two more alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.888" offset="4690944">He may sue to foreclose the deed of trust as a mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.498" offset="4717380">This is effective, it's cumbersome, it's expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.278" offset="4736502">It normally takes two to three years to clear a title when this procedure is followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.468" offset="4761266">It is not warranted in a practical business world unless there is a need and desire for a deficiency judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.303" offset="4792613">Under state law you -- you have to go through this procedure if you seek a deficiency of judgment against the -- the borrower, but you don't have to do it if you don't care about the deficiency of judgment and this brings us to the third alternative which is the one followed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.439" offset="4861158">The holder the deed of trust may sell under the power of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.464" offset="4881220">A sale of public auction which there is a 90-day notice filed of default followed by 21 days of publication in the legal newspapers of the county where the -- where the property is situated and normally the whole procedure is finished in 120 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.788" offset="4954572">It is simple, it is inexpensive, it makes possible prompt liquidation which is for the benefit of all concerned because you don't run up a lot of costs to depreciation the value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.289" offset="4996577">If there is likely to be any excess, it -- it develops better this way and it leads to results in a discharge of the obligation without the possible deficiency of judgment which might lead them to further assets of the borrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.264" offset="5048404">Then if the Government still after this procedure has gone through, if the Government still is stubborn about its lien, still stubbornly asserts its lien as it did here, having it ignored its numerous other means of protecting itself which I've outlined the purchaser of the deed of trust sale may sue as this purchaser, the bank did here to quiet title.</text>

            <text syncTime="1305.835" offset="5326764">I planned to bring it up later but this is probably as good a time as any.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.462" offset="5357171">The 2410 was spoken off yesterday as if it offered a single procedure for obtaining a clear title against Government tax liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.242" offset="5392384">This is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.147" offset="5400012">Section 2410 offers two alternative procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.798" offset="5426552">The first is by a suit to quiet title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.203" offset="5440136">The second is by a suit to foreclose the mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.873" offset="5454869">Now many procedural details to be followed in such suits are spelled out in Subdivision (d) and (c) of that section, but there is nothing in the language of that section to indicate that a suit to foreclose is essential or whether the suit to foreclose is a prerequisite to a suit to quiet title or that a quiet-title action is dependent in any way upon the prior completion of a foreclosure action and the legislative history of this amendment is quite interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.817" offset="5586631">It is totally inconsistent in my judgment with any notion that a foreclosure is necessary if the quiet-title procedure is followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.671" offset="5626023">It is -- it seems to me that it shows quite clearly that the purpose of the amendment was to provide an expedient procedure for clearing the title (Inaudible) Government's claim in respect the property of which no valid lien is attached in lieu of the complex, expensive, dilatory procedure by action to foreclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.309" offset="5708570">And I would like to direct the Court's specific attention to the most important element of that legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.653" offset="5742007">It is set out on page 10 of petitioner's main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.785" offset="5762487">This amendment was adopted in response to a request made by the then Attorney General Jackson in a letter which the relevant part of which I've quoted at the bottom of page 10 and I think that's worth reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.231" offset="5828315">Attorney General Jackson said, “It should be observed in this connection that under existing law”, this is back 1942, “Under existing law there is no provision whereby the owner of real-estate may clear his titles in such real-estate of the cloud of a Government mortgage or lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.818" offset="5902608">In many instances persons acting in good faith have purchased real-estate without knowledge of the Government lien or in the belief that the lien had been extinguished and then this important language, in other instances mortgagees have foreclosed on property and have failed to join the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.809" offset="5978572">It appears that justice and fair dealing would require that a method would be provided to clear real-estate titles of questionable or worthless Government liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.891" offset="6022980">Accordingly I suggest that the bill be amended by inserting the phrase “to quiet title or” between the words matter, “and for the foreclosure of” in line 4 in phase II of the bill and the Congress did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.153" offset="6084002">And it is our view, that that set up a completely independent alternative procedure in which the Congress specifically intended to approve the procedure which has been followed in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2499.090" offset="10099754">Then the taxpayer borrows money from the bank and executes a (Inaudible) which is duly recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.388" offset="10120965">This creates situation number two which the trustee under the deed of trust holds legal title and a power of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.683" offset="10150118">The taxpayer has a right to reacquire if he pays his obligation when due, but that right is subject to dissolution by the trustee if exercised of the power sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.438" offset="10193168">Then we have situation number three, this being chronologically indicated in which the Government acquires a tax lien on the taxpayer's right to reacquire but no lien on the legal title if the taxpayer does not default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.993" offset="10247293">But if the taxpayer defaults on his deed of trust obligation, the trustee (Inaudible) his legal title then you have the contract right to do under a state law and this preempts our fourth and final situation in which the buyer of the deed of trust sale has unencumbered legal title to the real-estate, the taxpayer's right to reacquire had expired by the term and no property right exists to which the Government lien can attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.114" offset="10343842">And then to summarize the whole thing in a few words as I can put it in, in the first place the taxpayer is entitled to a house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.477" offset="10377279">Then the trustees they're entitled to a house for the benefit of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.118" offset="10387832">The taxpayer has the right to reacquire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.857" offset="10398804">The Government acquires a lien on the taxpayer's right to reaquire but the Government has no liens against the trustee or the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.955" offset="10423150">If the taxpayer defaults, the trustee sells, the bank buys the trustee's title, the taxpayer's right to reacquire dissolves, is gone forever, and the Government lien remains firmly attached in that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2746.702" offset="11090213">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.267" offset="11104423">At the outset I would like to advert to a question which the Chief Justice asked yesterday and which was reiterated today which is the extent to which Section 2410 has been used in situations where the Government claims a lien on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.117" offset="11167848">And I've gotten some statistics together, they -- I cannot vouch completely for their accuracy, they're obtaining in a hurry, but I think they will demonstrate quite clearly that the general practice appears to be to use Section 2410 in situations where in fact the Government does claim a lien or an interest upon property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.781" offset="11258546">Now the cases are broken down into two categories because of the fact that 2410 is not limited to tax liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.786" offset="11290520">It also covers other Government liens and the tax lien figures are available from the tax division and the other lien figures from the other divisions and they're both civil divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.371" offset="11328867">They're broken down some what.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.254" offset="11336391">Now in the fiscal year 1959, our statistics show that the Government was named as a defendant in proceedings under Section 2410 in tax cases, in 2939 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.694" offset="11410160">In other words there are almost 3,000 cases during the last fiscal year in which in one form or another a suit was brought against the Government under Section 2410 either for foreclosure of a mortgage or to quiet title in which the Government claimed a tax lien against the property and a number of those cases has been ascending back in 19 fiscal, 1956 was 1808.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.583" offset="11513710">Now I also have some figures from the civil division.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.877" offset="11526875">Of course as I indicated in the civil division cases, they entail not only tax liens but a wide variety of other Government liens and those figures show that during fiscal year 1958, there were 737 cases in which the United States was named as a party defendant in a proceeding under Section 2410 either to quiet title, or their foreclosure and mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.280" offset="11632515">Now the majority of those cases were cases which were determined in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.581" offset="11657697">I want to emphasize this that these proceedings do not flood the federal courts because the United States has the right to removal and then the majority of cases, the right to removal is not exercised.</text>

            <text syncTime="5224.377" offset="21000861">Now the courts have treated it as a practical matter a mortgage and a deed of trust is very similar and what we really had here analytically I think is what we had yesterday in the Brosnan case that is, the indebtedness was created and in order to secure the payment of this indebtedness the debtor, the mortgagor gave to the mortgagee or the trustee or the beneficiary the power to apply the property, to sell the property and to apply the proceeds to the proceeds towards the discharge of his indebtedness, but they're attached to this property prior to the time of sale, this federal lien and this attached basically to the mortgagor or the taxpayer's interest in the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="5275.442" offset="21205138">And under well established principles once the lien attaches to property when the property is sold and transferred it passes with the lien unless the act of sale itself operates to discharge the lien from the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="5293.662" offset="21278072">As I've indicated we think it is clear that Congress has said that except when you -- or comply with the strict requirements of 2410, the State nonjudicial sales to which the United States is a party do not operate to eliminate and wipe out the federal liens on this real property and we therefore believe the judgment should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="5323.570" offset="21397608">I should like to direct your attention to one reference which it seems to me demonstrates the utter inconsistency of the Government's position here and then I'll devote the rest of the five minutes to an effort to answer some of the questions that that were asked of my friend on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.666" offset="21462079">The reference is to a revenue ruling which is quoted on page 6 of the petitioner's main brief which is rather short and it seems to me feels directly with the question involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5355.579" offset="21525713">It says, "Federal tax liens attach to property only to the extent of the delinquent taxpayer's interest therein where a taxpayer has only an option to purchase real estate" and this deals with an option now but it seems to me closely analogous to our situation here, “where the taxpayer has only an option to purchase real property at the time the federal tax lien arises, the lien attaches to the option, that is, to the interest of the taxpayer not to the real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.277" offset="21656430">Where his rights under the option are terminable the Government's right by virtue of its lien upon the taxpayer's interest, are likewise terminable, being no greater than those of the taxpayer.”</text>
