            <text syncTime="6.764" offset="130382">Before going into the technical legal argument to place the case in its proper perspective, I'd like to discuss for just a moment the economic hardship that these appellants have pleaded and which their affidavits certainly show.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.810" offset="230588">The record, however, if it's closely read will, I think, portray this situation of Alaska fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.006" offset="267368">The affidavits of (Inaudible) and those are the affidavits of the appellants, show that five canneries recent close -- recently closed in Southeastern Alaska representing 25% of the productive capacity of the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.588" offset="349706">One affiant stated that properties that were valued in 1947 at $533,000 were now worth $75,000, cannery properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.520" offset="405504">The appellant, Kake in here, for instance, shows that they paid, or the Federal Government paid for them $260,000 for their cannery equipment that is now worth $207,000 and that they are indebted in amount of $848,000, which means this, it comes through the record to you that they've lost money at the rate of about $100,000 a year.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.216" offset="536221">Kake, paid $363,000.The properties are worth $377,000 and their total indebtedness is $781,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.568" offset="581674">In other words, since 1950 to the time of those affidavits, they lost about $700,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.251" offset="612394">Kake did.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.916" offset="619081">Appellant, Metlakatla, I don't believe gives us the detail on their financial picture like Kake and Angoon due their -- their financial situation is not nearly as serious certainly as -- as Kake's and Angoon's.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.139" offset="667878">But what we have as a result of the depleted industry is, we -- we have something that, to me is like the dust bowl.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.537" offset="713540">It is the resource of the region and probably, if there was any material factor that -- that had as much to do with statehood, the -- the most material factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.265" offset="760456">I mean, of the wealth or the way the people live of Alaska when their quest for statehood was to control this fishery upon which we -- we have -- we had to have it, and it had been exclusively under the federal control and it was a -- it was a disaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.305" offset="832554">The Southeast -- the economy of Southeastern Alaska was in a disastrous situation and everyone including these appellants, when they voted for Ordinance 3 of the Constitution, when they voted in the referendum in 1948, voted overwhelmingly for the abolition of the fish trap to which we -- and our position is that we, the State, the son have watched our parent, the United States, in the control of this fishery, and maybe we can't do any better.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.067" offset="963688">But our position is, we have a right to try and if that's what statehood gave us, was the right to try.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.492" offset="989288">And that these appellants must try with us whether they want to or not at this time because at one time, they were certainly willing.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.485" offset="1017292">And the reason really that this -- this moved to abolish the fish traps are -- was led by appellant communities and others just exactly like them is because that was not their way of fishing.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.952" offset="1175176">If this was a compact, and that's what it says it is, then our understanding of that compact in -- for the purposes of interpreting that contract -- compact today is just as important as was Congress' intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.015" offset="1227421">Our understanding of it was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.538" offset="1237556">There are fish wheels on the Yukon River.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.630" offset="1249886">There are reservations in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.444" offset="1257200">There's a (Inaudible) Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.319" offset="1268694">There may be some fishing right.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.640" offset="1281964">We don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.247" offset="1288338">Congress didn't know, and Congress did not want to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.657" offset="1305997">In -- in the issue of statehood, they did not want to attempt to neither enlarge nor diminish whatever those rights might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.199" offset="1348211">We understood it, that it would be if someone could come in here and show a property right to the common fisheries that they would have it and we would no longer own it, but we construe Section 4 to be a disclaimer of property interest, not a disclaimer of state police power over our citizens when they start to fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.326" offset="1444655">We thought that it was -- a boat is a property right, a fishing area in our fishery is not a property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.839" offset="1478719">It can neither be bought nor sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.790" offset="1486555">That was open to all citizens and all citizens alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.880" offset="1502856">A fish trap is a device.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.744" offset="1510379">It's made out of -- of poles and wires and houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.048" offset="1523545">It has a house on it, for the watchman.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.180" offset="1536084">That is a property right, but there was no ever a property right to a fish trap site or location in the common fishery, and this Court held that in Hynes versus Grimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.761" offset="1582373">Now, there are fish wheels on the Yukon River.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.611" offset="1597837">There are international treaties which give the natives of Alaska the right to engage in -- in sealing, pelagic sealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.186" offset="1628139">They call it fishing sometimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.364" offset="1632841">Sometimes they call it hunting.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.839" offset="1638693">Those might be rights, but Congress did not want to concern itself with those rights or anything else, and so it said including fishing rights, and it should have said, “if any,” because that's what it means that we disclaim any right title and interest inany property, including fishing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.205" offset="1720195">That, you can't disclaim right title and interest to an Indian when he's fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.291" offset="1744541">Those are citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.556" offset="1749556">That's essential to our sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.181" offset="1760110">It's the biggest part of our -- of -- our biggest resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.040" offset="1779545">Although we could give away property, we cannot give away sovereignty and then we say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.238" offset="1800338">That if, as a condition of admission to the Union, we did cede sovereignty over our citizens on the basis of race, then that was an unfair exaction and it was an exaction as a condition to admitting as to statehood that violates the equal footing doctrine, because there's no other State in the Union that where such a principle is recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.004" offset="1879437">And I don't believe you can find any other Statehood Act where it says, “Including fishing rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="451.727" offset="1910262">Therefore, Congress said this, “We will leave that to future legislation or judicial determination.”</text>
            <text syncTime="458.813" offset="1938578">That's what the -- that's what the appellants are doing here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.154" offset="1951953">They came -- they're coming in here to attempt to establish a property right in this Court, as Congress contemplated that they should, but that should not be taken by this Court to mean that such a property right exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="517.331" offset="2172740">In the case of Tulee versus Washington, there was a treaty and the treaty provided that not only were the Indians involved in that case have the right to fish exclusively the waters on their reservation, but that they would have the further -- and this is a treaty right -- to fish in all usual and accustomed places that they had previously fished and that took them beyond the reservation, it took them into the common fishery, and this Court held in that case that they could not be charged a license fee because the license fee was not merely for purposes of regulation, it was also for purposes of taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="561.796" offset="2350582">That -- that whatever special rights they might give to -- to Indians on reservations would probably fall, would they not, if we decided with Alaska in this -- in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="576.418" offset="2409096">Would we not be saying at the same time that -- that wherever the Federal Government attempted to invade the police power as you -- of the State as you see it, that -- that they have done that unconstitutionally and therefore, the regulations or the statutes must fall?</text>

            <text syncTime="597.671" offset="2494046">This case does not present a factual situation which would -- which would permit you to reach that point except by dictum, because in Kake and Angoon, there is nothing even resembling a reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.867" offset="6542817">Perhaps that's what they meant by Indian fishing rights, a subsistence fishery, to catch fish and feed it to yourself and your dogs along the Yukon River, up north some place or maybe in this area too, but we're talking about the commercial fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.459" offset="6601226">Number one is, before statehood, there was never any right in any person to an exclusive right of privilege to the commercial fish -- fishery, and that included Indians, Aleuts, Eskimos, Whites, Swedes, Englishmen and Irishmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.556" offset="6685550">It included everybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="2307.335" offset="9332694">At that time, the United States held a municipal jurisdiction, as this Court observed in Hynes versus Grimes, held not only federal jurisdiction but you held municipal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.141" offset="9379924">You held a jurisdiction to control fish and game of Alaska because there was no State there, and because it had been withheld from the territorial government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2337.162" offset="9452022">We argue that when by operation of law, when municipal jurisdiction over fish and game and over the inland waters comes to the State when the State is created that those are the general fisheries laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.003" offset="9519417">And if you want to look at the status quo, if there's one thing the Congress did by Section 4, it said, “We want to reserve the status quo.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.977" offset="9547316">That's the reason that we weren't worried about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.008" offset="9571453">The status quo was that everybody fished as equal under the general conservation laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.034" offset="9595486">We have always disagreed with the Department of Interior as to what conservation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.822" offset="9618683">But I don't think this Court will argue with us what we think conservation is because I think that's our determination and the appellant, Metlakatla, has admitted that the -- the reason for banning was for conservation purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.657" offset="9666017">Now, we argue that, although as -- with any migratory resource, if you're going to give someone exclusive right to fish, if you're going to give them 80 acres and say no one else can trespass on this area, to shoot birds or anything else, if you want to give them 80 acres of water and say no one else can fish there, that's all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.628" offset="9753893">We really aren't trying to knock out that reservation unless as a last resort, we have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.066" offset="9775626">But we say this that giving them the exclusive right to fish under the general fisheries laws of United States, which are now the general fisheries laws of Alaska, the only reason you made general fisheries laws up there is because you exercised the powers of a state government in that area, there was no state government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.197" offset="9848142">Now, there is a state government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.480" offset="9857337">And the control of a migratory resource as this Court observed in Dow versus Ickes means nothing, means nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.783" offset="9890461">And this was a fish trap case, Dow versus Ickes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.715" offset="9902268">It means nothing unless it work -- works to the final end of conservation and you don't have a -- and you don't have a conservation chain with a reservation in the middle of it that -- that reaps the fruits of conservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.097" offset="9955767">You can use dynamite and dynamites are the most effective way there is to fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.924" offset="9971022">If you really want to catch fish, dynamite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.844" offset="9986800">That's even more efficient than a fish trap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.718" offset="9998294">But they've always said, “No".</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.544" offset="10009579">This is a migratory resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.889" offset="10014908">It has to be controlled as a migratory resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.915" offset="10023058">It has to be followed from the spawning streams, in the hills to the high seas.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.587" offset="10057749">And our argument is, that Metlakatla, with the exclusive right to use this area did not have and does not have the right, the unregulated right to fish.</text>

            <text syncTime="5474.627" offset="22001873">And that's the first transcript of record, not the supplemental.</text>
            <text syncTime="5479.076" offset="22019636">It has been referred to persistently as raising a question of a concession on the part of Metlakatla.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.604" offset="22069791">The final paragraph in that affidavit says that the purpose in seeking ban on the use of fish traps in Alaska was to conserve the runs of salmon.</text>
            <text syncTime="5500.805" offset="22106572">That the use and operation of the four fish traps of the community -- well in but a very minor manner if any affect the conservation of salmon in Alaska waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5511.867" offset="22150875">That the State of Alaska will not suffer any material damage if the traps are permitted to be operated while on the other hand, if the Indians of the reservation are denied the right, they will suffer irreparable damage and loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="5524.566" offset="22201657">It's his feeling that a good deal of moral was read into that paragraph than the paragraph deserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.755" offset="22234363">I want to recur to the references that had been made to the basis of the secretary's action in authorizing these fish traps.</text>
            <text syncTime="5544.843" offset="22282742">I think perhaps it's best shown by the new regulations which are proposed and in the red appendix at page 34 and 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.661" offset="22338017">We find the places set forth in the federal register as is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="5563.469" offset="22357243">We find that the authority is not merely the White Act to which reference was made but that it comes under Section 2 and 9 of Title 25, Section 485 of Title 5 and cites other acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5579.926" offset="22423071">Now, I think that a little more could have been said on Title 5 of the U.S.Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="5587.211" offset="22452224">They cite Section 485 which says the Secretary of the Interior is charged with the supervision of public business relating to the following subjects first and then second, the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="5602.341" offset="22512724">They did not cite Section 22, the so-called housekeeping statute on departmental regulations which applies to all departments and says, “The head of each department is authorized to prescribe regulations not inconsistent with law for the Government of his department and the performance of business and two or three other including custodial matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5627.037" offset="22611571">The sections with respect to Title 25 of the Code, Title 25 as Indians, Section 2 which is cited in this assertion of authority on the part of the Interior -- of the Secretary, says, “The Commissioner of Indian Affairs shall, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior and agreeable to such rule regulations as the President may prescribe in the management of all Indian affairs and of all matters arising out of Indian relations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5657.333" offset="22732675">And the other sections, Section 9, the President may prescribe such regulations as he may think that for carrying into effect to the various provisions of any act relating to Indian Affairs and for the settlement of the accounts of Indian affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5674.464" offset="22801220">The next item on which I was concerned arose in response to some questions of Mr. Justice Douglas respecting Hynes against Grimes Pack -- and refer to the fact that he had decided that the Court's opinion is something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="5693.794" offset="22878542">I must confess that I have the same misunderstanding of the holding in Hynes against Grimes Packing as had Mr. Justice Douglas if I understood correctly his questions until I got around to studying it for the sake in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5709.667" offset="22942072">Hynes against Grimes Packing held very flatly concluding at page 116 that there was a valid establishment of an Indian reservation at Karluk in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="5735.488" offset="23045308">That the Secretary of the Interior did have authority to establish it, but it then went on to hold concluding at pages 122 and 123 not as I have sort of vaguely recalled the Court held and as I believe we shared by one member of this Court but to say we find nothing in the White Act that authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to grant reservation occupants the privilege of exclusive commercial fishing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5771.816" offset="23190653">Now, the holding of that case is not as I understand it but because of the White Act, no such rights could be accorded by the Secretary but that he had ceased the wrong authority and you couldn't say that the White Act authorized him to put an exclusive right in the hands of the natives.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.989" offset="23287306">He would have to look elsewhere and the balance of the opinion carries that distinction through all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5811.469" offset="23349269">I've been further concerned with the references that would indicate that while Metlakatla may very well be confined to the island down there that Southern tip of Alaska where it lies for each fish traps, that somehow under Kake and Angoon have a role making profit to go all over Alaska and fish, fish traps wherever they want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5844.901" offset="23483016">I wish to call attention to the President proposed regulations, if I may, at pages 36 and 37 of this red appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="5955.427" offset="23925112">I‘m informed by Mr. Schifter that he can say that all fishing trap sites were specified either White or Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="5966.342" offset="23968789">These Indians, of course, set by here for quite a while and watched non-Indians fishing the traps, which later was the cannery were purchased by the United States and turned over to Indian fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5982.067" offset="24031692">However, the fact is that as to Indians since the Secretary exceeded the closing up all fish traps except Indian fish traps, the Secretary has very directly regulated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6002.224" offset="24112253">This is not an unregulated right if that impression has been given this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6007.483" offset="24133256">The Secretary of the Interior is manifestly concerned with the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6011.502" offset="24149347">He has fish and wildlife under his jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6014.614" offset="24161782">He is manifestly concerned with preserving the salmon lives there as necessary to Kake and Angoon and the Metlakatla as they can't be to anyone else in Alaska and they are regulated by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6029.859" offset="24222804">The size of the traps is unimportant, I suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6033.560" offset="24237641">The question is how many fish you take out of them, not what gear you use and traps can be regulated and are regulated to determine how much of a pack you take out of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6045.867" offset="24286856">It's no different if you spread it amongst more men perhaps running the actual boats and they take just as many fish with yawl nets or purse seines or some other method, we're really confusing to quite different issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="6063.450" offset="24357177">I repeat again that in my judgment, there is no conservation issue here unless Alaska can say “Well, the Secretary isn't going to regulate this from a conservation standpoint but we would.”</text>
