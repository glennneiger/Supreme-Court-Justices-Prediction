            <text syncTime="78.171" offset="416057">He was allowed to make inquiry in regard to police reports in the -- any possible participation or collusion.</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcom Richard Wilkey</label>
            <text syncTime="104.307" offset="520652">Now, after having detailed the facts of this case, which we believe indicate very clearly that there was no arrest until after the officer saw the contraband and that there was in fact no search and seizure in the sense known to the law that there was in effect abandoned the contraband which was taken by the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.671" offset="614066">I want to come to the applicable law particularly the Henry case decided in November 1959 of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.755" offset="646353">Now, I think it most important that in the Henry case, there was a concession by the Government in the trial court which was adhered to all the way through these proceedings in this Court that there was an arrest when the agents stopped the car in Henry.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.450" offset="709151">And the Government said, and it was noted hereby in the Court's opinion that we were not arguing in Henry that the arrest did not take place at a later time.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.840" offset="754709">We adhered to the concession, and that we would argue at this point as to the time of arrest in the Rios case, and that is what we are doing now.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.764" offset="790444">Now, we do not think that it is too relevant in all cases as to how the car was stopped because we do believe that there is a right to halt a moving vehicle for the purpose of inquiry even though there is no arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.025" offset="855437">But if there is any distinction between who causes the car to be stopped, we point out that in this case, Rios, the car was halted at the light behind other cars in traffic at the time that inquiry was first inaugurated.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.146" offset="915937">Now, Mr. -- the Court speaking through Mr. Justice Douglas in Henry said, when the officers interrupted the two men and restricted their liberty of movement, the arrest, for the purposes of this case, was complete.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="217.356" stopTime="224.133">
            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="217.356" offset="972779">I think you reserved the decision on the -- this case, right now didn't we, this Rios case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="malcom_richard_wilkey" startTime="224.133" stopTime="225.371">
            <label>Mr. Malcom Richard Wilkey</label>
            <text syncTime="224.133" offset="999946">Exactly, Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="225.371" stopTime="226.541">
            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="225.371" offset="1004857">The Rios case, yes.</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcom Richard Wilkey</label>
            <text syncTime="226.541" offset="1009560">We pointed out that that would be argued later in the Rios case in the footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.867" offset="1022830">So we think that on the standard, even enunciated in the opinion here in Henry, when the officers interrupted the two men and restricted their liberty of movement, the arrest for purposes of this, the Henry case, was complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.190" offset="1076120">But here there was no restriction of movement of the petitioner until after he had dropped the contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.234" offset="1100257">He was sitting in a halted car and the officers merely came up to the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.040" offset="1123558">Now, the Court further stated in Henry, and this is very applicable here as to there reasonableness of the officers actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.481" offset="1157308">The police must have reasonable grounds to believe that the particular package carried by the citizens is contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.434" offset="1185102">Its shape and design might at times be adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.441" offset="1201089">The weight of it and the manner in which it is carried might at times be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.059" offset="1219584">Now we submit that the container -- narcotics in Rios to any police officer conversely with the narcotics strategy spelled out narcotics by its shape and design and by the color and size.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.763" offset="1274441">The officer could not ignore what his eyes told him as he saw the narcotics container on the floor of the cab.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.710" offset="1306206">Now in the Henry case, there was a dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Clark in which Mr. Chief -- the Chief Justice joined, in which it was said that the Government concession that the stopping constitute an arrest was, I'm not using the words in the opinion there, but in effect was unnecessary and unwise in the facts of the case, and the dissent said that no arrest until after the agents found other facts which would be probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.380" offset="1412890">Here we say that on both the majority opinion of the Court in Henry and on the dissent, here clearly that mere inquiry an identification by an officer as to who he is, in nowise constitutes an arrest and therefore that the arrest could not have taken place until after the contraband was visible and meant to that police officer of what it really was.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.801" offset="1574536">It's not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.928" offset="1579133">And the reason it's not clear, Mr. Justice Harlan, is because everything took place in the period of one minute and the cab driver was obviously nervous and it is only his evidence which indicates in any way that the officer drew his gun until after the man was outside of the cab and the officer had his hands on him and he was resisting arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.562" offset="1673592">All of the other evidence, the testimony of the two police officers, Beckmann and Grace showed that the officer had a badge in his left hand and a flashlight in the right until such a point after the contraband was identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.502" offset="1737331">Now, to sum up on the arrest, we say that there was a right to inquire of the petition in the cab.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.165" offset="1764080">No arrest was made or intended until after the officers saw a package which in all probability contained narcotics, and at this seeing the package plus the circumstances leading up to the inquiry did constitute probable cause for an arrest, and if the Court of Appeals there was a seizure in the sense known to the law, a probable cause to arrest and seizure too.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.046" offset="2587564">Yes that's what he said, and then if you will Your Honor look at what the Court said correcting me with which petitioner's counsel agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.681" offset="2686098">Now logically, as we have argued in our brief, the seizure here and the admission of evidence does not depend upon actually the lawfulness of the arrest, because the evidence here was contraband abandoned in a public cab and its seizure did not depend on establishing the arrest or probable cause for the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.912" offset="2775019">Now on that, we would rely on Mr. Justice Holmes' opinion in the Hester case cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.521" offset="2801455">In the Hester case, it was a prohibition -- a liquor case, there the prohibition agents in consequence of information, and by the way the record shows at page 21 of the record in that case that the only testimony as to information was one of the agent says, as the result of information, they grove to the vicinity of Hester's house.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.889" offset="2898944">They went there and they concealed themselves and they saw Hester come out of the house and hand another man a bottle.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.355" offset="2924753">There was an alarm given to somebody on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.140" offset="2935933">Hester took a gallon jug from an automobile standing nearby and both men ran away.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.713" offset="2958190">One of the officers pursued and fired a pistol.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.205" offset="2972191">Hester dropped the jug and the other man threw away the bottle.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.382" offset="2984939">They were found on retrieving by the officers to contain moonshine.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.713" offset="3002180">The officers had no warrant for search or for arrest when they were on the premises of Hester.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.106" offset="3023809">This Court through Mr. Justice Holmes in holding the evidence admissible found it unnecessary to decide whether the action of the officers which caused Hester to betray himself was legal saying at page 58 of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.923" offset="3083055">It is obvious that even if there had been a trespass, the above testimony was not obtained by an illegal search or seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.189" offset="3120149">The defendants own acts and those of his associates disclosed the jug, the jar, and the bottle.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.899" offset="3147003">And there was no seizure in the sense of the law when the officers examined the contents of each after it had been abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.027" offset="3183470">Now here, you'll have in the Hester case the officers being on the premises without warrant, observation a chase in the pursuit in which a pistol was fired and the moonshine was dropped.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.193" offset="3232162">And the Court held that there was an abandonment of contraband and there was no search and seizure which depended on the legality of any warrant or depended on the legality of any arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.986" offset="3279287">I think that we can also draw an analogy from the Abel case decided yesterday in which items six and seven, which were left in the hotel room by Abel, were then picked up by the FBI after Abel had been taken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.786" offset="3354520">Abel, as I remember the facts, had rented that hotel room until later in the day but when he went with the agents, while they paid his bill with the desk and the hotel room was then reverted to the inn keeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.407" offset="3404988">And so there -- the -- I think the Court held in Abel that the admissibility of both items six and seven found by the agents after the arrest taken place, did not in anyway depend upon the validity of the arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="889.645" offset="3661928">I believed that was the holding of the Court in the Abel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.041" offset="3675512">That same principle was applied in 1954 in the Lee case from the District of Columbia where officers were interrogating two people in a car and asked them to get out of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.174" offset="3716054">They got out and in so doing they dropped the stolen jewelry in the gutters and it was held there on the authority of the Hester case that there was no search and seizure as known to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.544" offset="3757537">Now then I want to get to an examination -- by the way the trial court, the District Court rested his determination on both the abandonment of the contraband theory and on the fact that there was no arrest until after the petitioner alighted from the cab or after the discovery of the contraband which in his view constituted probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.961" offset="3847189">I want to make it clear that I think that the key time is the discovery of the contraband, not the time the petitioner alighted from the cab whenever it is, but I think that was subdued.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.946" offset="3887208">Now I want to get to the third point which involves as a possible adoption of this Court, the rule of exclusion on the federal courts as to evidence which is found by state officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.339" offset="3944678">I want to say at the outset that as I read the precedents involving this rule that's applied to federal officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.672" offset="3986056">Weeks, Center, Burdeau versus McDowell, which is not federal officers neither was Center, but the Weeks rule as -- that has involved federal officers for the good reason of the discipline of federal officers and it was felt that the exclusionary rule what implement the command of the Fourth Amendment not necessarily being required by the Fourth Amendment, but it would implement the Fourth Amendment and it would serve as a deterrent and it would be as applied to federal officers, be effective in enforcing compliance with the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.015" offset="4127431">We submit to the Court that the reason for the exclusionary rule of Weeks as applied to federal officers does not apply, does -- does not follow where state officers or private individuals are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.855" offset="4182810">Even in the federal courts, this exclusionary rule has not been completely effective as witness the cases coming before this Court and the other Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.699" offset="4218128">And I think that this Court and the other courts can note that there are significant differences perhaps among the federal agencies varying with their training as pre to core their methods of recruitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.887" offset="4262954">There are many factors involved in making the exclusionary rule work, which exclusion in Court is only one, but it does have a disciplinary effect on federal officers and there is a certain rough justice where the Federal Government is both the prosecutor and the federal officers are the ones who participate in the seizure in making the real effect to excluding the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.199" offset="4372146">They are, in Mr. Justice Frankfurter's phrase of yesterday, in the same household, and so it does have that effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1077.980" offset="4415300">I think that, that is the reason which has been articulated in the opinions of the Court as to the basis of the rule, Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.320" offset="4456678">I am aware that in dissenting opinions as Mr. Justice Holmes and Brandeis that there has been another rule -- another reason that is to say that the Government should have no part of and should not adopt or ratify or have the benefit of in a dirty business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.737" offset="4530343">But it is our position that the real reason for it is one of effectiveness, and that we must distinguish between the physical evidence itself and the actions of people over whom the Government has no control whatever in obtaining the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.041" offset="4615502">The evidence is probative trustworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.463" offset="4633266">It's not the federal officers who are bringing the prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1139.332" offset="4660746">And there has to be, as many times said in the Court, weighing and the balancing of the laws in law enforcement by the exclusion and the gain in the enforcing the constitutional mandate and where the officers are federal or there's federal participation and there's force on degree of control, it is believed that that is effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.575" offset="4753638">But I think that while there is another reason for it, that other reason has not been adopted by the Court, and in fact I believe impliedly, it was rejected in the dissent, I think rejected in the dissents where the dissenters urged it and it was not applied in Wolf versus Colorado where it was left to the states to make their own rules and their own choices.</text>

            <text syncTime="1319.026" offset="5379427">But on the Fourth Amendment, I think that courts have been primarily concerned in the majority opinions of the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1415.920" offset="5767084">First of all, here we're dealing with state officers and I think that the majority of the Court -- the Court has held that the restriction of the Fourteenth Amendment on state officers is not exactly the same as the restriction on the Fourth, the Fourth Amendment on federal, that's one point on the constitutional command itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.507" offset="5853393">And the second point is that there is a choice of the method of enforcing the constitutional command, and that is what I want to argue before the Court now that the Court should not adopt a method of an exclusionary rule which everyone knows results in otherwise guilty people going free unless there is another benefit to society, in other words, that the rule of exclusion would be effective and improve the due administration with the enforcement of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.131" offset="5987871">Before you move on to that consideration, Mr. Wilkey, when we start to take into account I think in dealing with these considerations one that the Court should be pure, and I mean this, and two that the enforcement of law for society benefit should be affective without hampering something very offensive, that among the 50 states, there are various standards both in statute law and in decision of law as to what constitutes an illegality in an arrest or in a search, which that this Court decided yesterday that is a merely because warrant is based on hearsay doesn't render it illegal and insufficient under the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.049" offset="6223600">Now, state may hae a much higher standard than that, ultimate constitutional standard are not the last word of morality or delicacy of thinking, they are rather under minimize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.734" offset="6274278">And so you may have state declaring warrants illegal way above the standard that would satisfy the Fourth Amendment, and it wouldn't have a general exclusionary rule of having evidence obtained through illegal steps by way of search or arrest may invalidate the introduction or render inadmissible the introduction of evidence which the federal court themselves in enforcing the Federal Constitution would not have been illegal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1750.946" offset="7107166">And I think I used that in argument along with the Abbate opinion -- argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.884" offset="7138931">It seems to me that aside from the disciplinary reason for the exclusionary rule as a flag to federal officers there are -- all of the other arguments the non-constitutional argument of the dissenters, Mr. Justice Brandeis and Holmes, those -- that this is dirty business that the courts must remain pure and have nothing to do with it that -- that all of those arguments are equally valid as was urged in the Burdeau case, whether a private individual is involved or whether state officers are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.670" offset="7294098">And the possibilities of connivance, collusion, vast irregularities in the administration of federal justice are just enormous when we consider the possibilities that are opened up by seeing that the federal court, in some way, is responsible for the actions of private individuals, private detective agencies, local constables, local magistrates who air on the law as to what constitutes a valid warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.256" offset="7432443">All of those things are equally valid arguments for private exclusion no matter who is guilty of the wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="1848.706" offset="7498167">And I think that for a court to hold that to adopt the position of the petitioner in these two cases would be to overrule all the precedent of Weeks and Center and Burdeau versus McDowell and also to overrule the rationale of Wolf itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.111" offset="7583848">The -- I also want to say that the -- it seems to me the application of the exclusionary rule in federal court should not differ between the states as to whether the states has an exclusionary rule or not, that we must have the same standard in (Voice Overlap).</text>

            <text syncTime="1900.388" offset="7704952">Now it seems that in considering the application of this exclusionary rule there you got assume two set different situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.881" offset="7758869">Take the case of an intentional violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.091" offset="7775692">Well, if it's a warrant situation, here you have a state magistrate passing on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.185" offset="7804113">The educational requirements of state magistrates vary and you have irregular results, the country over and you have to postulate if you have an intentional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.136" offset="7855940">You have to postulate either the ignorance or connivance of state magistrate in obtaining the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.785" offset="7878510">Then if you postulate an intentional violation in a no warrant situation, here you must have in a split second operation like the seizure in Rios.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.953" offset="7919156">You must have a policeman making a careful analysis of the situation and saying to himself that under California law, I couldn't get it in the State Court but I can get it in in the federal court and so, I'll grab it and finally have a federal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.734" offset="7978297">Now those things just don't take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.830" offset="7990732">So I think that on the practicalities of the thing that an exclusionary rule in the feral court would be ineffective if you assume an intentional violation whether it's a warrant or not a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.875" offset="8046843">Now, if you assumed an unintentional violation, you make federal justice dependent on the errors not only of every local police officer but also on the legal wisdom of the local magistrate throughout the country when seeking a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.068" offset="8115597">Now if -- of course intentional violation assumes no fault at anytime, whatever is using this evidence than the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.687" offset="8158124">And so, it seemed in a practical way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.819" offset="8174634">If the discipline of the state exclusionary rule itself, as they have in California, will not improve the discipline of state police, a federal exclusionary rule will have no effect -- further effect whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.196" offset="8236178">Take this case of Rios for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.697" offset="8250180">California has a rule of exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.043" offset="8259584">They adopted it in the Cahan case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2414.302" offset="9760580">He's going probably to do the same thing he does now lay that affidavit and that warrant beside his code, his state code and he has formed both because are -- it is assumed in these cases that come up that there is no federal participation and there is only an intent for a state prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.212" offset="9832260">And so that's all the law enforcement officers and the magistrate is going to be concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.209" offset="9856188">Then think of the training of local police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.332" offset="9872697">Some have none whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.772" offset="9882415">Think of the caliber men that are recruited that varies widely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.601" offset="9901746">Think of the legal acumen of the local magistrates, because for instance in Elkins, this was not only the error of a deputy sherif, it was the error of the District Attorney if it wasn't error of his chief assistant and of the magistrate on Thursday night reversed on Monday morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.640" offset="9969977">So an adoption of the Weeks rule would make federal justice dependent on all these varying factors and would not be effective in improving the training of state officers and making the compliance with the constitutional standards more of a reality.</text>

          <turn speaker="harvey_m_grossman" startTime="2508.066" stopTime="2672.726">
            <label>Mr. Harvey M. Grossman</label>
            <text syncTime="2508.066" offset="10135594">The Court please, in the time remaining few additional points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.043" offset="10159522">First of all, we submit an answer to a query as to why the federal court should -- why this Court should not accept findings of -- so-called findings of the lower court, the fact that first as it's been indicated there were no findings in any sense of the term mere conclusions for the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.351" offset="10232769">Secondly, this is not merely a case where two courts were involved but three and perhaps two of the three took one view that at least the state court took a different view and this certainly raises questions and they raised -- those questions are particularly serious in light of the fact that first the stories, we submit, a reading of the record reveals beyond question that Officer Beckmann changed his story in several particular as he testified quite differently as to the sequence of opening the door, a very important fact in the state court than he did in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.349" offset="10364740">There were important versions here and differences and these aren't indifferences between defendants and plaintiff's story, these are differences in stories the Government presented with the stamp on arrestee presumably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.717" offset="10414268">Certainly the Government can't come in here and say the cab driver, when he testified to the revolver incident after the Government put him on as a witness, is one of the Government is going to try to impeach now because they were putting on someone who wasn't going to tell the truth nor can the Government say that Mr. Forno who was counseled for the defendant in the state court proceedings knew more about what transpired there than the witnesses present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.687" offset="10502144">In short, we submit this is a case where the record on the state of facts is such that examination by this Court is warranted and called for and that one other fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.911" offset="10546970">The Chief, Mr. Chief Justice Warren raised the question as to restrictions and cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.102" offset="10567764">We've looked a little more carefully than the Government perhaps because we find several instances for example on pages 84 to 85 of the record, the state court -- the Federal District Court Judge announced the very restrictive rule of cross-examination stating that all that could be done was to raid the inconsistent statement into the record and that nothing further could be done because that's the limit of impeachment under his view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.795" offset="10670582">We submit it's an erroneous view and it's unfortunate that he thus limited examination as to a key issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.099" offset="10699734">At that point, we were trying to show the inconsistency in the prior statements as to the sequence of events of opening the door and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.671" offset="10730036">There are other instances when we attempted to get into the question with federal participations, as the Government mentioned they were restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.941" offset="10759084">Again, we were restricted in our cross-examination on page 65 when we asked Officer Beckmann what's his intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.866" offset="10786879">Was he intending a search and seizure?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="2672.726" offset="10794297">What page?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_m_grossman" startTime="2673.655" stopTime="2868.592">
            <label>Mr. Harvey M. Grossman</label>
            <text syncTime="2673.655" offset="10797955">Page 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.431" offset="10809135">And the Government objected on the ground that matters of intent were irrelevant and therefore the Court sustained the objection and that was the end of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.446" offset="10853125">In short, there were various instances where we did not have a full opportunity to present all of the cross-examination in the federal court and this should be considered in judging the federal court's determination or its approach of the adequacy of its determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.577" offset="10909654">Now with reference to the Henry case, we submit, that if the petitioner had endeavoured to drive off and Officer Beckmann approached with the avowed purpose of investigating narcotics to see if defendant had narcotics in his possession, obviously, whether with -- with we they call a revolver or what the Government counsel refers to as a flashlight, most certainly he would have taken forceful means of stopping the defendant, so the defendant was at that point under restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.190" offset="11024175">And further, Officer Beckmann made a formal arrest prior to the time he ever actually had any real opportunity to examine the narcotics because that was after defendant alighted from the cab, he was grabbed by the arm again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.457" offset="11077151">The driver says also grabbed while inside the cab and told that he was under arrest, only then, that the police actually bothered to take the trouble to look at the material in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.009" offset="11115395">Now, insofar as the question of adopting a rule by this Court is concerned, first of all, there was we submit federal participation here not at the time of the search and seizure, but when the federal prosecution used this evidence in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.377" offset="11184880">When the federal courts permitted a prosecution to be sustained on the basis of this evidence, at that point we think, the federal courts should properly have evoked an exclusionary rule, an exclusionary rule pattern not on the basis of the flexible standard the Government suggests but rather on the same basis as the exclusionary rule for federal officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.327" offset="11268681">After all California has found that rule the only means of deterring unlawful searches and seizures by its officers -- its officers, so of 20 other states so of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.499" offset="11305357">And we submit that interest of state policy required a different result seems rather far fetched, nor cannot be said if we accept the Government's change in emphasis from page 55 of its brief where it said the disciplinary effect is the key item here saying other elements of the exclusionary rule at precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.125" offset="11383829">Even if we accept this to be the fact, we submit that the same considerations applying for adoption of the exclusionary rule for the federal courts, likewise apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.180" offset="11424057">After all if office -- let's consider Officer Beckmann is going to do next time he seize the cab and let's assume the lack of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.038" offset="11463555">Perhaps he wasn't aware of the silver platter doctrine when he seized the evidence in question but he didn't stop at the state courts, he took the evidence to the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.664" offset="11494066">And if this Court holds that that's perfectly proper, one can well wonder what Officer Beckmann is going to do the next time he seize the taxi cab.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.810" offset="11526562">Is he really going to worry about the exclusionary rule or constitutional problems if only he has to do was go across the street to the federal court house and introduce his evidence and get the prosecution brought to a conclusion just the way he wants it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2912.651" offset="11753932">And if this Court lays down a principle under which a conviction he's obtained under these circumstances is sustained, I can hardly doubt that Officer Beckmann, the next time he's confronted with the situation of this sort, is going to take the silver platter doctrine very much into account, so of his fellow officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3040.115" offset="12263842">Well, in answer to that, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, it is our position that to deter -- that police officers as California feels, other states, and as the federal courts felt in adopting the Weeks' principle are deterred if they feel that, by granting evidence illegally or without lack -- with lack of probable cause, if they feel that in doing so, they're getting evidence that will not be admitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3083.174" offset="12436041">We think that's been a sound rule in California practice, may I say in conclusion, as evidenced in our brief reveals that since the adoption of the exclusionary rule in California, in the Cahan case, there's been a marked improvement in standards and we think that if the federal court -- if the federal police agencies are encouraged to assist the states in this effort by knowing that federal prosecutions would be interfered with this if they don't, that even further progress can be made.</text>
