            <text syncTime="6.709" offset="130173">At the time of the recess, I was discussing the question of whether there was any waiver by the petitioner so as to prevent this Court from considering the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.817" offset="198614">And I pointed out that while no specific objection was made before it had been raised time and time again during the proceedings as to due process and the effect of Rule 42 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="40.161" offset="264025">But in any event, petitioner's position is that this is a constitutional right and while it may not be the rule in this Court that this right cannot be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.729" offset="346258">Nevertheless, there must be an express conscious waiver as in the case of a trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.382" offset="388890">This Court held in the cases which involved the question of waiver of trial by jury that it must be an express conscious waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.719" offset="426297">And as a matter of fact, in the Rules of Criminal Procedure promulgated by this Court, there is a requirement of an express conscious waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.075" offset="475721">No such express conscious waiver occurred in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="97.450" offset="493171">Do you question the clearing of the courtroom while the question was being put by the judge to this witness?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="myron_l_shapiro" startTime="107.027" stopTime="208.741">
            <label>Mr. Myron L. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="107.027" offset="531519">I do, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.541" offset="541550">No, I do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.327" offset="548655">But I say that that question has to be determined by how the proceeding ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.604" offset="569762">If it ends, first of all, with the questions being answered, there's -- that's of no consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.336" offset="596720">But ends perhaps with the man being given a coercive sentence, that is being given into the custody of the marshall until he answers the questions, then perhaps it's not improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.841" offset="646771">But if it ends in a conviction for criminal contempt, then the -- that clearing of the courtroom becomes improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.413" offset="681044">Now, I say that that's not -- also, I say that this is not basically an important question because the only propriety which can be ascribed to it arises out of the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.791" offset="742588">But in this case, the Government contends that he -- petitioner was not prejudiced because what transpired before the judge in putting these questions was immediately recorded and immediately transcribed and given to the public anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.909" offset="807058">So that the question of propriety would have nothing to do with it as far as I can see because for a further reason, that is that this was a -- a proceeding which the district judge described as one under 42 (a), to determine whether this man was going to be held in criminal contempt or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.732" offset="898278">It was therefore then in the nature of a criminal proceeding and it have to public.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.803" offset="922624">In that aspect of it, I say that that order was improper.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="208.741" offset="938297">Supposing the judge has gone to the grand jury room, in the whole proceeding including the holding of him for contempt in taking the place in the grand jury room.</text>

            <label>Mr. Myron L. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="221.050" offset="987617">Well I would say in that situation that that would be error too because that would be a denial of due process and there would be a further complication which we don't have in this case and that is that the petitioner would not then have had counsel because certainly, counsel would not have been permitted into the grand jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.848" offset="1058774">And I say that the fact that it's held in the grand jury room, in the judges' chambers or in the courtroom makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.661" offset="1086046">If it results of a criminal conviction for criminal contempt, then the proceedings have to be public.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.820" offset="1118647">It is only, I say, where the contumacious act has occurred in open court before the judge and in the view of the judge that he can summarily adjudicate the man in criminal contempt, otherwise, he must proceed in accordance with the usual requirements of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.350" offset="1204746">Now, this may seem to impose an unnecessary burden while you take the view of the case as the Government does that there is no issue of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.958" offset="1247169">But Chief Justice Taft in the Cooke case points out that there are always issues of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.575" offset="1269635">Maybe no issue of intent as there was in the Cooke case.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.387" offset="1284890">That issue may not be present here but there is an issue of mitigation, an issue of extenuation and other issues which may arise in the nature of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.474" offset="1321253">And in that situation, there certainly should be a hearing, should be notice and a specification of charges because that is what due process requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.353" offset="1364825">Now, I have not spent any time on the question of the Sixth Amendment but it would seem to me that once you arrive at the answer that due process requires a trial of a hearing, then the Sixth Amendment applies and there -- there must be a public trial because the Constitution to some extent, maybe not to the extent that other -- some people would like to see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.418" offset="1473076">The Constitution must, to some extent, apply to criminal contempt proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.135" offset="1487914">At some point, the inhibitions and prohibitions of the Constitution must apply to a situation where a man is held in criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.712" offset="1522186">He has no right to trail by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.438" offset="1533158">He has less rights than the ordinary defendant in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.595" offset="1549772">And I say that's certainly one of the rights that he must have under due process and under the Sixth Amendment is the right to a public trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.788" offset="1598568">Now, it is also clear, I submit, that since this is a constitutional right, the petitioner did not have to show -- does not have to show prejudice while there are some few -- some cases which hold that the defendant and where the public has been excluded in the show of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.933" offset="1691146">There are other cases and more authoritative cases which hold that he need not show prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.482" offset="1717269">And that's especially true here because with -- we are concerned with a constitutional right, the depravation of a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.095" offset="1747780">And this Court has consistently, in the main held that where a constitutional right, such as the right to a public trial of due process is concerned, there need be no showing of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.195" offset="1796159">And this record does not disclose any showing of prejudice but we submit that this is not a bar to reversing this conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.673" offset="1846105">One of the important questions in this case is, when did the right to a public trial or public hearing or to the admission of the public whether you want to call at a trial or a hearing or some other kind of proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.218" offset="1900231">When did that right accrue?</text>
            <text syncTime="453.215" offset="1916217">It is petitioner's position that that right accrued when he was called to that stand in the courtroom by the district judge and the questions were put to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.943" offset="1963133">This was as the district judge said, a contempt proceeding pursuant to rule 42 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="472.376" offset="1992913">This was a proceeding to determine whether he was in contempt of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.359" offset="2008795">He was therefore in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.276" offset="2020498">He was in jeopardy of his liberty at that point and it would seem to me that is, at the point where in the nature of proceeding the witness or the defendant is put in jeopardy that it becomes a trial or proceedings which must be public.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.696" offset="2090193">And therefore, we say that the right to a public trial accrued at the time that he was put on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.392" offset="2140975">The questions that we have raised here on the issue of public -- of a hearing in this type of case are, I respectfully submit, very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.707" offset="2202206">It may not be so apparent on the face of this case but the fact is that endorsing such secret proceedings in federal criminal investigatory practices can lead to many oppressive occurrences.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.415" offset="2273050">For example, a witness could be served early in the morning, what they forthwith, the subpoena to appear before a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.918" offset="2315055">But to appear before that grand jury and refuse to answer be taken down before the judge, directed to answer, take him back to the grand jury, refuse to answer again and then be adjudicated in contempt, convicted of a crime all in secret and possibly be in the penitentiary or prison within the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.972" offset="2407215">This sort of thing can lead to abuses in addition to the fact that it is a claim and clear depravation of due process of law and denial of the rights under the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.994" offset="2459355">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="594.149" offset="2479940">Mr Monahan.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_r_monahan" startTime="595.652" stopTime="973.262">
            <label>Mr. Philip R. Monahan</label>
            <text syncTime="595.652" offset="2486000">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.066" offset="2507630">In the Brown case of last term, this Court held that where a witness has been directed by a judge to answer a question or group of questions before the grand jury and the witness refuses before the grand jury, to obey the judge's order, the judge while he may, in his discretion, institute a proceeding by notice and hearing under Rule 42 (b) in which hearing, since the contempt did not occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.797" offset="2722565">In present of the judge, there would have to be adduced proof of the fact that the witness refused to obey the judge's instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.824" offset="2778676">But that on the other hand, the judge in his discretion could give the witness another chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.007" offset="2819427">In effect, perhaps waive the completed contempt before the grand jury and give the witness another chance, a -- a locus poenitentiae, I think it was the -- this Court put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.727" offset="2882330">In a new proceeding in the presence for the grand jury presided over by the judge in which the judge personally propounded the questions to the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.642" offset="2941889">And then if the witness again refused, the contempt since it occurred in the presence of the court and under the eye of the judge, could be summarily punished under Rule 42 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="728.032" offset="3015450">Now, the essence of a summary proceeding under Rule 42 (a) is precisely that there is no hearing, there is no trial because there's nothing to try.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.082" offset="3059649">The judge thought the contempt happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.271" offset="3076472">Therefore, I think that it is apparent that the constitutional guarantee of the Sixth Amendment toward speedy in public trial which is granted to all accused just have no applicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.656" offset="3138017">It's not an exception, it just has no applicability to a proceeding under Rule 42 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="766.475" offset="3169259">Now, counsel had referred to the Oliver case.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.421" offset="3189008">It seems to me that the Oliver case has very little -- very little in common with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.853" offset="3210742">That was a case where the contempt -- where the offense, although denominated contempt, actually was allegedly perjurious testimony before the judge grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.728" offset="3274271">And the reason why the judge thought that the testimony was false was that another witness would appear before the judge, had given a different version of the events.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.996" offset="3323382">And the judge without any trial, without according the witness counsel or giving him any of the incidents of a trial, adjudicated him in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.540" offset="3365491">And this Court held that that could not be reconciled with due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.690" offset="3398092">Well, in this case, the most important distinction is that there was nothing to try.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.519" offset="3437484">As I said before, the contempt occurred in the eye -- under the eye of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.035" offset="3455561">I think that's the most important distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.531" offset="3461517">Another distinction is that here, the most important member of the public, the petitioner's counsel, was concededly present throughout the proceedings vigorously asserting the witness' interest every step of the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.394" offset="3524942">It seems to me, that far cry from the situation of the Oliver case, entirely apart from the other distinction that I mentioned a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.425" offset="3561096">Now, the question might arrive, and that should before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.875" offset="3578859">How about the adjudication itself?</text>
            <text syncTime="871.720" offset="3590248">Should that have been (inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="873.759" offset="3598399">Now, I'm -- I'm distinguishing now between adjudication of contempt and a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.878" offset="3618879">As I point out a moment ago, there was no right to a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.925" offset="3635075">But should the judge, after the witness had disobeyed the judge's order to answer the questions right in the presence of the judge, should he then have opened the doors to the public?</text>
            <text syncTime="897.638" offset="3693902">The -- the session at that time was properly closed in the public since it was an essence of grand jury proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.458" offset="3717204">Should he then have opened the doors to the public?</text>
            <text syncTime="906.408" offset="3729011">Possibly so but I think that particularly in view of the fact that the judge asked counsel for the -- for the witness to -- to give him any reason why he should not pronounce the witness then and there in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.978" offset="3823261">And neither the witness nor his counsel nor anyone present suggested to the judge, “Your Honor, remember this is still close to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.715" offset="3862235">Before you adjudicate this man in contempt, you should reopen the -- the courtroom to the public.”</text>
            <text syncTime="946.085" offset="3887731">If that had been done, I'm sure -- I'm sure the judge would have had no hesitancy in doing that, but it was not done.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.322" offset="3916675">In other words, there was no objection made and it has elementary that the purpose of an objection is to avoid a situation where a judge is, so to speak, trapped into committing error.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.046" offset="3979577">Now, it seems to me that there just -- is no (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <text syncTime="1616.371" offset="6568835">I just wanted to take a minute or two of this Court's time, if Your Honor please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.752" offset="6594330">On the Terry case, Mr. Chief Justice Taft in the Cooke case said -- he affirmed Terry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.816" offset="6626617">It was there held that a court of the United States upon a commission of a contempt in open court might act summarily without trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.607" offset="6665801">The important distinction between the Terry case and this case that is the Cooke case and having some at bar is that this contempt was not in open court, this was brought out in -- in the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.889" offset="6730898">So that the -- this Court's understanding to now on the Terry case has been because on its facts, it was a contempt committed in open court that it dealt with contempts committed in open court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.720" offset="6786278">I also wanted to call Your Honors attention to the Sacher case, the contempt proceeding there 343 U.S. 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.278" offset="6832462">In that case Mr. Justice Jackson answering an argument of the petitioner's counsel there that (Inaudible) could have taken the lawyers out of the hearing of the jury and up to the bench and convicted him there for contempt each time they overstep the line, said that this is not possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.809" offset="6918562">I'm not quoting him exactly, he said, "In the Oliver case, we held that the contempt conviction must be public and therefore, it cannot be done in that way."</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.475" offset="6965269">And I might also call Your Honors attention to the fact that the Cooke case was a contempt committed in chambers because the letter which cast as versions upon the district judge was delivered by an agent of the attorney who was held to be in contempt to the judge in chambers during a ten-minute intermission for rest and refreshment as to before it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.925" offset="7071117">And the Chief Justice Taft said that this is the mistake of the Court of Appeals and the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.007" offset="7099434">They considered this a contempt committed in open court, it was not committed in open court, and therefore, the procedure in the Cooke case was held to be bad and I respectfully submitted that the procedure here should be bad on the ground of secrecy.</text>
