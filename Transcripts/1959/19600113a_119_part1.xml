            <text syncTime="25.253" offset="204361">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.852" offset="218781">This is a matter that comes before the Court on petition from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on the question of a conviction of the petitioner who was convicted of transporting a woman in violation of the Mann Act in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.973" offset="307284">The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.434" offset="321076">Now although we have two questions involved, namely whether a woman transported in violation of the Mann Act by a man she subsequently marries maybe compelled to testify against her husband in the face of his assertion of the common law privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.328" offset="400697">And secondly, whether there was sufficient collaboration of the petitioner's admissions of interstate commerce or interstate transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.271" offset="444479">It appears from the Government's brief at page 19 that the second point is virtually conceded, and that if the Court finds that the admission of the wife's testimony was in error, then we need not to consider the second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.193" offset="516159">The facts very simply are these - There was an indictment of the petitioner for transporting a female Mary Kathleen Byrd from Columbus, Georgia to Dothan, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.723" offset="574255">There's testimony of a bell boy at the hotel in the Alabama city that he saw the petitioner and this woman in the hotel room, that there were various conversations between the bell boy and the petitioner and the woman regarding business, referring apparently for the business of prostitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.111" offset="663803">There's testimony of a city detective of the Alabama city to the effect that he found bus ticket stubs in the possession of the petitioner and that their was a confession taken from the petitioner, and as related by the city detective, the petitioner told him that he had purchased two tickets in Columbus, Georgia, that he was going to Laguna Beach, Florida but that they stopped in Dothan, Alabama, and then on this trip, he was accompanied by Mary Byrd.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.936" offset="811133">Mary Byrd, the wife then was called to testify and it appears that she testified that she was formally known as Mary Kathleen Byrd, that at the time of her testimony, she was married to the defendant, the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.952" offset="895143">And she then stated that she refused to testify on grounds that she was married to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.403" offset="928998">She offered to exhibit to the Court a marriage license.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.504" offset="949373">The Court refused to examine the license and the Court overruled her objection and required her to testify.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.347" offset="1084792">So, we have clearly the question of whether her testimony of events that occurred before the marriage should have been allowed over her objection and over the objection of the defendant himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.186" offset="1336090">Answer - Mary K. Wyatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.518" offset="1345494">The prosecutor - “Mary K. Wyatt” (unbelievingly), because apparently he expected her answer to be Mary K. Byrd.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.048" offset="1507558">And then at record 57, I believe it is, the Circuit Court for the Fifth Circuit says, “The fact that the transportation occurred before marriage certainly would not any the more disqualify the wife.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2216.370" offset="8968861">That is Wigmore and the other authorities on evidence indicate that ordinarily the marital privilege, if it obtains, is conferred in a situation like this as much as in the situation where they were married at the time of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.999" offset="9035316">Wigmore says that even if he marries the woman after she has been subpoenaed to appear as a witness at trial, it would be valid to raise the -- the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.822" offset="9074709">The theory being that the privilege is to protect the husband and wife relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.960" offset="9095189">This operates conversely from the marital communication privilege in which the -- the communication was before marriage that the marriage is not privileged and after divorce the privilege still holds good for those communications that were made during marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.703" offset="9162167">Wigmore says that this operates the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.785" offset="9170526">We are willing to concede that too that that would be the ordinary operation of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.583" offset="9197693">But we claim that in this case the privilege doesn't attach whatever and into it does not attach, there is nothing privileged here to protect, she is compellable as any other witness would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.621" offset="9245863">Petitioner makes a great deal out of the privilege as being some kind of a fundamental basic legal right which is entitled to protection and which is entitled to extension to almost remote analogies, but we feel that the more fundamental principle is that a testimonial duty which rests on every citizen to give testimony in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.508" offset="9353383">This is something which is at least as old and honorable as any marital privilege because it goes back to the early English subpoena powers of chancery and to the Statute of Elizabeth compelling testimony in courts of law in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.857" offset="9414823">The -- the analysis of the Government is basically that the privilege itself is an intrusion on what would be the ordinary rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.021" offset="9467486">It makes no difference from the standpoint of analysis, whether we say that the exception as to offenses against the wife is an exception to a privileged rule or whether we say that the rule simply doesn't cover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.145" offset="9519940">In our way of thinking, it makes no difference to the outcome of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.720" offset="9554213">In the Hawkins case last term, the Government did propose a rule whereby voluntary testimony by spouses would always be allowed and compelled testimony would never be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.248" offset="9604368">This Court rejected that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.928" offset="9615130">We are here today asking the Court to apply the rule it stated in Hawkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.884" offset="9638954">In Hawkins, the Court noted that there is this exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.167" offset="9656090">It also noted that there was no known distinction in the previous cases on which the Court relied which justified a distinction between voluntary and compelled testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.227" offset="9708231">Now again, that brings us back to this point that if the privilege is not attached, then we feel that there is a duty which is operative here and under which the wife must testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.311" offset="9768626">This goes even deeper to the policies which underlie the privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.941" offset="9795166">We have a basic public interest in getting at the truth in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.799" offset="9814601">The ordinary evidentiary rules are designed to get at the truth and to aid that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.907" offset="9843022">They hearsay rule, the opinion rule, and these other rules ordinarily ensure against the introduction of untrustworthy or unreliable data to the submission of the fact finder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.652" offset="9901955">A rule of privilege on the other hand, operates as a bar against getting at the truth, as a shield against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.747" offset="9934346">So that the only reason for which a privilege is warranted is that we have some other public interest such as here the marital relationship which requires protection even at the expense of getting at the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.094" offset="10003728">We claim that here in this limited situation of a Mann Act prosecution, we do not have a pattern which requires the operation of the marital privilege.</text>
