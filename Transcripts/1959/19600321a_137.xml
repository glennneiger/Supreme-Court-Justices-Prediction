            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="14.905" offset="162983">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.369" offset="176880">This case which is here on a writ of certiorari to the Third Circuit and the case which immediately follows it bring before this Court the questions whether a Government tax lien, which is admittedly junior to a previous mortgage on real property, may be divested from that real property, when the mortgagee follows state foreclosure proceedings to which the United States has not been made a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.206" offset="296208">In each of these cases, what happened briefly was that a mortgage was given subsequently federal tax lien is attached to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.059" offset="331630">In this case, the mortgage was foreclosed under state procedures pursuant to a power of mortgagee to confess judgment and in the next case pursuant to power of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.555" offset="373635">It is conceded in each case that in carrying out the foreclosure, the mortgagee fully complied with the provisions and requirements of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.608" offset="421804">And then under state law, the effect of this foreclosure would be to eliminate private junior liens that had attached to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.625" offset="461824">The Government's position simply stated in these cases is that whatever maybe the effect of this procedure on the elimination of private liens, it cannot operate to eliminate the federal tax lien that is attached to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.979" offset="527339">I want to emphasize here that this case has presented no question with respect to priorities of liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.199" offset="552208">This is not a conflict basically between the Government and other groups as to which lien has priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.782" offset="578539">The Government concedes in these cases that it has no claim against this property unless and until the prior mortgage has been fully satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.961" offset="619186">Our claim basically is that when the prior mortgage is fully satisfied, we are entitled to satisfy our tax claim out of any excess that maybe produced over and above the amount of the first mortgage and as I will develop, the Congress has provided certain specified procedures designed to ensure that.</text>

          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="159.259" stopTime="367.099">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="159.259" offset="740394">As I understand not under Pennsylvania law, under California law in the next case, there will be, there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.797" offset="766516">Now, I will refer briefly in my argument of three rather detail provisions relating to the elimination of tax liens, and I would like to just summarize it at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.512" offset="813432">The first provision in Section 7403 of the Internal Revenue Code 1954, under which the instant case was brought, and this basically authorizes the United States to file a preceding to foreclose the tax lien with respect to real personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.938" offset="895143">In addition to that, another provision is Section 7424 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.832" offset="922728">Now that is a simple matter, it gives someone who holds a prior lien prior to that of the United States or someone who purchases at a sale to foreclose that lien the right to institute himself a suit to determine the interest in the real property after going through a request to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and that has to request to institute the other type of suit, and it's denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.345" offset="1020740">The last provision is Section 2410 of Title 28 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.012" offset="1047385">That is a provision which authorizes the institution -- I am sorry, authorizes the United States to be made a party to a proceeding to foreclose on mortgage or the client title.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.770" offset="1098480">And I would like to emphasize at the outset something very significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.791" offset="1114572">Now that is the only one of these provisions which specifically provides that if the provisions there and are followed the effect of foreclosure on junior and subsidiary liens is the same as under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.721" offset="1170265">In that one case, Congress has said that if you comply with these procedures, you look to state law to see what the effect of foreclosure is.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.357" offset="1196805">But in that situation where state law wipes out the lien, it does, the United States is given a year within which to redeem.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.380" offset="1232854">Now, the basic facts in this case are not disputed and are relative simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.159" offset="1251976">In 1948, some people in apartment purchased some real property and gave that a bond and mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.306" offset="1280606">The bond on defendants laying a practice is the equivalent of a promise to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.069" offset="1299623">The bond and mortgage were properly recorded and the bond authorized the mortgagee to enter a confession of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.110" offset="1331806">After that time, the various federal tax liens attached to this property and the tax liens were properly recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.764" offset="1362422">In 1955, there was a default under the bond, and on June 7th of 1955, a surviving mortgagee entered a confession of judgment in accordance with the authority under the bond and mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.720" offset="1422294">At that point, they filed the Pennsylvania practice of issuing a writ to the Sheriff to sell the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.804" offset="1446640">But, proceedings would delay while they procure it from the state court a rule to show cause why the United States should not be made a party to these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.022" offset="1495437">The United States did not answer this rule, and thereafter, the Pennsylvania State Court issued an order purporting to make the United States a party to the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.362" offset="1536815">I say purporting because the District Court subsequently held that that attempt to make the United States a party had failed because it have been begun too late.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.662" offset="1658023">Now Mr. Justice, I think on the theory which the court held -- below held that the proceeding permits the United States only to be made a party to a proceeding to foreclose a mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.675" offset="1710059">And then in this case, the judgment had already been entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.235" offset="1724270">The confession of judgment had been entered and as the District Court held, they merely intended to make us a party to a proceeding in execution of the foreclosure.</text>

            <text syncTime="417.100" offset="1771813">If the Government or its law pursue to serve with any legal proceeding to which they need not, as a matter of law, make a response, is it the custom, is it the practice or -- to disregard it entirely or make some suggestions to the Court why it is improper?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="435.826" stopTime="449.067">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="435.826" offset="1846627">Well, I suppose a better practice would be to indicate why, but I think there are instances where it was taken that since it is improper, we do not have to respond, and responding might, in some way, be construed as a recognition I suppose to the litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="451.875" offset="1910888">Now, during the course of this proceeding, the respondents before this Court purchased the confessed judgment and the bond in mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.981" offset="1955297">And early in 1956, the property was sold at a sheriff's sale and the respondents Brosnan and Jacobs who had previously purchased the mortgage, board in the property for slightly better than $6,000, the amount of the original bond and mortgage was $45,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.087" offset="2027708">One year later, the Government attempted to redeem the property by making a tender to one of the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.650" offset="2061981">This tender was rejected as inadequate in amount and the District Court upheld that ruling that the tender was improperly rejected and the issue is no longer in the case, because the Government abandoned that argument in the Court of Appeals and is not pressing it in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="959.091" offset="3939767">There's another proceeding under Pennsylvania practice which the District Court referred to under which foreclosure started by -- without any entry of confession of judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="990.179" offset="4064110">But, if -- I might just refer to the finding of the District Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.867" offset="4094830">In holding that the federal lien was cut off by the state proceedings, the Court recognized that in Pennsylvania a mortgage creates only a lien and not in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.511" offset="4149373">And it also found that the Government lien fastened upon a title to real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.793" offset="4174555">So, there's no question in this case that under local law, the mortgage interest here is that solely of creating a security interest in favor of the mortgagee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.739" offset="4222307">The mortgagor retained the title of the property at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.726" offset="4238294">Now, the District Court however held that the state proceedings had the effect or eliminating the federal lien on the real property, and the Third Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.526" offset="4297435">The Third Circuit held, in effect, as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.049" offset="4311542">It said that since under Pennsylvania law, the purchase toward a sheriff's sale takes the same title as the debtor had prior to this execution, and since further under Pennsylvania law, the -- lien the -- execution relates back to the time when the mortgage was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.217" offset="4404224">This meant that once the execution had taken place, the Government had no interest in the property at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.837" offset="4426689">It goes back, it cuts off the mortgagor's interest and therefore, the United States had no remain -- no interest to -- there was no interest to the mortgagor to which the Government lien for the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1203.167" offset="4916015">I think that in most states at least, today and mortgages generally is only a security interest, and our basic position in this case is that as long as the mortgagor retains the property interest, as long as it's secured -- the mortgage is given only a security for a debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.358" offset="4996786">When that happens, the federal tax lien attaches to that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.748" offset="5014340">In other words, here, you have a property subject to a security lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.406" offset="5037014">And in effect, what has happened is really the mortgagor has said to the mortgagee, “I am going to give you the right to sell this property if I don't pay my debts, and you may then apply the proceeds to the payment of my indebtedness to you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.154" offset="5112038">Now, the State of course may and properly does determine what the effect of that kind of proceeding that sale the property to satisfy the interceding debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.532" offset="5173478">What effect this has on the junior lien that it creates?</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.344" offset="5192704">But we believe that the State cannot purport to say that because state interest has cut off to this proceeding, the federal interest similarly can be cut off in situation where the United State has not been made a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.458" offset="5261249">Now, we have set forth in our brief the various provisions which Congress has enacted dealing with this difficult subject of federal liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.394" offset="5300955">To begin with, Congress itself has provided the duration of the liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.839" offset="5318719">The statute says that unless another day the specifically fix by law of the tax lien arises when the assessment is made and it continues either until the liability for the tax is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.287" offset="5380472">Then, the United States has given the power under Section 7403 itself to bring a suit to foreclose its lien and to have all the interest in the property determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.888" offset="5430941">There's another provision, Section 6325 of the code which provides for the administrative release of liens in a situation where as a practical matter, the Government's lien has no value and application maybe made for administrative discharge, and even the whole lien can be discharged or the lien maybe released from specific property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.622" offset="5521847">And finally, there's this general statute, Section 2410, which permits the United States to be made a party to any civil action either in the District Court or in a state court having jurisdiction of the subject matter to prior title or to foreclose a mortgage or other lien on real or personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.318" offset="5612648">And in discussing this Section, one other point should be mentioned is that under this Section, not only are there various provisions provided for the protection of the United States, such as the lien of the Government must be described by particularity, appropriate notice and so on, the Government is also giving the right to remove the case to the Federal District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2220.601" offset="8985788">And then under the Pennsylvania Law, state liens fair better than federal liens in the foreclosure proceedings followed here, because under Pennsylvania law, the state lien for taxes will be discharged at a foreclosure sale only if they amount realize at the foreclosure sale is sufficient to pay off the state liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.577" offset="9081710">And in fact, in this very case, the amount that was bid at the foreclosure sale by the purchasers who were the, in effect, the successes to the mortgagees was an amount sufficient to pay the cost of the sale and pay off the local taxes.</text>
