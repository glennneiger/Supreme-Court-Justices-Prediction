            <text syncTime="41.259" offset="268413">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.663" offset="290043">Mr. Cecil Jones was convicted in the District Court of the District of Columbia for violations of the Harrison Act and he is now in the federal prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.315" offset="332675">By timely and proper motions, he objected that all the evidence against him was unlawful, unlawful because it was obtained by unlawful seizure pursuant to an unlawful search, pursuant to an unlawful warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.441" offset="397145">The Government never claimed that the search was lawful, they never claim the warrant was lawful, but they said that it didn't matter and so for purposes of this part of our case, if it please the Court, we submit that we might treat the case as though the prosecution admitted that the warrant was unlawful and that the search or seizure were unlawful and that the lower court so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.718" offset="502262">But they said, nevertheless the evidence did not have to be excluded and the conviction could stand because Jones did not show -- did not show the proper standing to object to the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.244" offset="576345">He did not show the proper standing because in relation to the premises, he asserted only the qualities of a guest.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.001" offset="607378">And in regard to the material seized, he did not show the kind of interest, the kind of possession which is necessary to sustain this standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.507" offset="657429">Well, in fact if the Court please, as we will show Jones was the occupant to the apartment searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.871" offset="682820">In fact, the Government in a formal document asserted that the Jones was the occupant of the apartment searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.132" offset="715943">In fact, the Government tried and convicted Jones of possessing the narcotics which were seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.400" offset="752933">Despite that fact, they said that Jones did not show his standing and so as a result --</text>

            <text syncTime="222.429" offset="993050">If we get by the standing issue, Mr. Justice Whitaker, the question that remains to the decided is whether there was probable cause for the issuance of a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.210" offset="1028263">The only document before the Commissioner who issued this warrant sir is an -- is an affidavit and that affidavit is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.038" offset="1067551">We submit and we believe the Government agrees that that kind of decision as to the adequacy of that affidavit to support the warrant is one which can be decided just as well by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.910" offset="1107048">It's not a jury question in any sense and there really no reason for sending it back to the lower court in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.156" offset="1135992">The facts in this case, if the Court permits, are not in dispute so far as it's relevant to the preliminary issues with which we are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.657" offset="1169951">On August 21, 1957, the police obtained a warrant for the search of an apartment in the District of Columbia and the warrant referred to the apartment as occupied by Cecil Jones and Earline Richardson, Cecil Jones is the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.373" offset="1248841">The affidavit which the police filed with the Commissioner to obtain this warrant described the apartment in question as occupied by Cecil Jones and Earline Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.601" offset="1301817">When the police armed with this warrant, came to the apartment, they knocked on the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.039" offset="1327522">There is some dispute as to what happened but if the Court permit, it is not relevant to this particular issue so we will postpone it to latte.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.673" offset="1354062">In any event, it is clear that it was Jones who answered the knock and said, "Who's there?"</text>
            <text syncTime="318.943" offset="1379140">Police knock again and again it was Jones who answered that knock.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.308" offset="1400560">It was Jones who went to the window and seeing some stranger down there who would turn out to be as plain cloths man but he didn't know it, said, "Call a janitor, there's someone at my door and he won't go away."</text>
            <text syncTime="335.161" offset="1444028">So, when they called the janitor, the janitor came up and he knocked on the door with the police beside him and when the janitor knocked, again it as Jones who answered the door and said, "Who is there?"</text>
            <text syncTime="345.767" offset="1486451">And when janitor answered, "It's the janitor."</text>
            <text syncTime="349.027" offset="1499512">He, Jones opened the door slightly on the night latch at that moment under circumstances reveal described, whether the police broke in and as appears quite clearly from the record, they treated Jones as in charge of this apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.437" offset="1581119">Well, the police in this apartment found Jones, Ms. Richardson and four others.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.635" offset="1601912">They found some narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.379" offset="1612884">The police decided to charge Mr. Jones and Ms. Richardson with violations of the Harrison Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.522" offset="1641409">The four other occupants of the apartment were not charged, and the prosecution against the Ms. Richardson was apparently never pressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.600" offset="1681742">So, Jones alone was held responsible for what happened in that apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.211" offset="1708178">Now if it please the Court, if one examines the documents that followed immediately after this arrest defines first a police complaint in the record on page 5, a final commitment in the record on page 6, and indictment in the record on page 7, all charging Jones with possession of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.285" offset="1788531">But Jones shortly after his arrest made a motion pro se in which he asked that the indictment be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.281" offset="1824475">He claimed that the indictment, that the -- his relation to the apartment was not such as to prove the Government's case that he was the one who was in possession of whatever was in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.944" offset="1871182">He also made some arguments about the probable -- no probable cause apparently either for a search warrant or for arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.330" offset="1900648">It's not very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.393" offset="1904933">It is a -- it's the documents of an illiterate Negro, 31 years old representing himself in the case at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.452" offset="1941191">Well, shortly thereafter the -- he was assigned counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.176" offset="1956028">The counsel disowned this motion to dismiss the indictment and instead counsel made a motion to suppress the evidence on the ground that it was obtained pursuant to an unlawful warrant which was deficient on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.163" offset="2019976">At the hearing of this motion, the Government oppose that on the ground -- and on that Jones did not show the necessary standing to make this kind of a motion and so counsel for Jones put him on a stand and the facts which -- to which he testified are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.425" offset="2077027">He said, the apartment in question belonged to a friend by the name of Arthur Evans who's some five days earlier had left Washington for Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.578" offset="2109733">He gave Jones a key to the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.717" offset="2118196">He gave him authority to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.405" offset="2128959">Jones used it.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.081" offset="2139721">He had a suit and a shirt there in addition for the clothes he was wearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.753" offset="2158425">He slept there "maybe a night," that's what the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.640" offset="2181935">Well, despite this evidence the motion judge denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.636" offset="2205968">He said that, “Cecil Jones was only a guest and therefore had no standing to make this motion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="532.268" offset="2232404">Then the parties went to trial and at the beginning the trial before Judge Holsoff, counsel for Jones repeated the motion and Judge Holsoff took the position that he was bound the earlier holding and he did not reexamine it.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.476" offset="2305233">At the trial, the Government present of its case, and in the course of its case, it introduced evidence in which it showed that Jones had said to the policeman, "I live in this apartment."</text>
            <text syncTime="563.593" offset="2357791">They introduced evidence which showed that Jones had admitted that the narcotics were his or some of them were his.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.181" offset="2388093">At that point and before the defense introduced its case, again counsel moved to exclude this evidence and the trial court said no, noted to the record in effect didn't do anything about motion and Jones was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.224" offset="2448280">On appeal that the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia divided, affirmed the conviction by two to one and this Court granted certiorari as well as the motion to proceed in forma pauperis.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.795" offset="2506585">Well, if it please the Court, the key to this standing issue we submit is that the Government does not deny that Jones has standing, by that we mean, the Government does not deny the facts which it would admit are enough to constitute standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.498" offset="2597386">Their position basically is that Jones did not consult affirmatively show these facts, assert these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.639" offset="2629883">They don't deny the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.161" offset="2636048">They couldn't deny the fact because one of the facts which clearly qualify his for standing his possession and that is exactly what they were trying to prove in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="843.962" offset="3479176">It simply says the Government which after all has to prove its case can't make out a case of possession merely on the basis of my relation to my property and what they have shown.</text>

            <text syncTime="862.616" offset="3553886">Well, he must have had advised to over her shoulder then Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.894" offset="3566947">In any event, if the Court please, we believe that this motion on careful reading is not an admission that the narcotics are his.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.024" offset="3607489">We believe that even if it were, not a -- not a statement that the narcotics are not his, we believe that even if it were, it would make no difference under the cases as we will show and we also point out that this motion was disowned and on the whole the Court treated it and did not refer to it in anyway and neither does the Government make much of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.538" offset="3693484">There's -- we submit several -- there are we submit several grounds on which Jones had standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.748" offset="3726399">Two of them we submit are so obvious that the only trouble with that is, is the -- is that Jones himself did not wish affirmatively to assert it for reasons to which Mr. Justice Harlan alluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.459" offset="3765164">But we submit in the first instance, that even on what Jones affirmatively showed at the time of the first motion to suppress, Jones had standing to object to the search and seizure and therefore to object to the introduction of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.039" offset="3835486">Now, if the Court pleases, the standing in the sense is the short hand, we will use in effect for saying that constitutional rights of Jones himself were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.983" offset="3875297">That it was unreasonable for the police to come to this apartment to look for a narcotic of Jones's without a lawful warrant and the assumption now is that the warrant was not lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.220" offset="3936214">We have pointed out that the affidavit and the warrant refer to this apartment is occupied by Jones and the occupancy of the apartment, no one has ever denied is enough to constitute standing to object to searching that apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.301" offset="4000580">One might have thought that this would be an admission by the Government with which it ought to be bound but while we suggest that, we are not pressing it and the case is considerably stronger than that.</text>

            <text syncTime="998.771" offset="4098487">It's a phrase used by the lower courts which established rule and we submit that it ought to mean control, in charge of the apartment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1012.984" offset="4155329">They said it was occupied by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.736" offset="4170271">The standing rule to which we are now referring to -- with which we are now referring Mr. Justice Stewart was developed at the trial of the lower federal courts as we shall see in a little while and they all struggled with what is the quantum of interest which one has to show for standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.362" offset="4240802">Now, it is clear that either a necessary quantum of interest in the premises of search or -- or of in the disjunctive or the necessary quantum of interest in the material seized are enough to give you a standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.454" offset="4297226">The latter was held in the Jeffers case, three years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.237" offset="4312273">Well, the courts below, gentlemen of the Court used very different words and we've collected some of them on page 30 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.203" offset="4356159">They talk about control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.875" offset="4366921">They talk about dominion of the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.797" offset="4382595">They talk of -- I mean necessary of an interest, of some interest in the premises some of them just say anybody but a trespasser and clearly Jones was not a trespasser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.040" offset="4431496">Some of them use the phrase “lawful occupant,” clearly Jones was a lawful occupant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.455" offset="4453230">Some of them use the word “licensee” and we submit without wanting to get into the niceties of property law that Mr. Jones was a licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.618" offset="4493876">Some say dominion and control and we submit that Jones one the admitted the facts had dominion and control of this apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.608" offset="4533791">The Government's brief on page 26 if the Court permit says and I quote, "He did not in any realistic sense have a dominion of the apartment."</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.216" offset="4576214">Well, if the Court please, that's exactly what he did have in any realistic sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.544" offset="4601501">I -- we -- we submit we're not sure what the word “dominion” supposed to mean in this, but any realistic sense, Jones was the man who had the key to the apartment, the authority to use the apartment, and he was the man who acted as in charge of the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.173" offset="4660015">The police treated him as in charge of the apartment when they came in and showed him a -- showed a warrant, they didn't show it to five other people sitting in that room.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.197" offset="4684152">They showed it to Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.186" offset="4692093">We submit all preferences that matter, Jones was the man in charge of this apartment and should be held to have standing to object with seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.403" offset="4720933">What does it mean that he's in charge?</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.122" offset="4727829">It would mean, we submit that he has a right to keep out trespassers and I would have thought that Mr. Arthur Evans in length in the apartment would not only want him to but insist that he keep out trespassers and trespassers we submit includes the police, perhaps a fortiori, if they come in unlawfully without a warrant.</text>
