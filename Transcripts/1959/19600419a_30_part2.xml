            <label>Mr. Greene Chandler Furman</label>
            <text syncTime="118.918" offset="579062">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.869" offset="582823">Well, they are available and we thank Your Honor for raising the questions that was not explicit as it should have or could have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.657" offset="625977">Furthermore, I think as to the reason of the constitutional question, it might be well to refer to Mr. Eaton's opening statement found on page 17 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.754" offset="678431">The second paragraph, the first one from the top of the page rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.241" offset="692328">I mentioned that the word “we”.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.825" offset="698702">“We are here this morning on the question of the merits of the habeas corpus petition and of course, it is a contention of the defendant, Mr. Earl Taylor, that the affidavit filed against him does not contain for a sufficient to constitute a criminal charge and that the ordinance so far as it permits the entry of these inspectors into his private home without a search warrant is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.538" offset="797550">I think with that language before the Court, he is bound to take judicial knowledge of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.690" offset="830151">I don't see how that conclusion could be avoided because it's inescapable.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.433" offset="861080">And to indicate that the Court was aware of this question, I referred to page 32 of the record and this is a comment of the trial court, Judge Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.444" offset="945194">And it's the second and third paragraph from the top.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.608" offset="965778">They Court, “That is true, Mr. Duffy however, we are in this issue concerned with the major issue and that is as to the constitutionality of the ordinance as it apply -- as it applies to this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.373" offset="1040906">I think that it is possibly the chief issue we have here and also a collateral one.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.474" offset="1065253">I believe that would be subject to this inquiry that in charge -- that is the charge as it applies to this gentleman.”</text>
            <text syncTime="249.163" offset="1100048">Now, his personal reasons may throw us all for our cause a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.937" offset="1115094">That is the only reason I'm commenting upon it at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.908" offset="1135052">I think such we're discussing what the trial court had to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.365" offset="1156786">I'd be well to refer to remarks of Judge Thomas on page 11 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.569" offset="1213628">This is the second paragraph from the top.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.067" offset="1227630">“The proponents of ordinances which provide for unlimited number of inspections,” I've forgotten which one of Your Honors asked me about how many inspections could be held and that is my authority for that remark, the conclusion of Judge Thomas of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.416" offset="1305057">That's in the -- “For an unlimited number of inspections of private homes at reasonable hours, contend that the execution of this ordinance does not violate the right to privacy in homes, provision of the constitution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="315.295" offset="1364511">They don't see what else the trial court could have been referring to other than the Fourteenth Amendment, Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.419" offset="1401083">They could clearly have that in mind, although he didn't use the words as I'm using them here now, but I think he expressly had that in mind when he used this language here.</text>
