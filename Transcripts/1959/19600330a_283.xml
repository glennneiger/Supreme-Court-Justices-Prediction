            <text syncTime="8.818" offset="138637">Mr. Bernhard, you may continue your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edgar Bernhard</label>
            <text syncTime="14.090" offset="159744">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.829" offset="178657">The issues in this Hertz case are similar to those in Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.602" offset="197778">This case arises under the 1954 Code and involves the double declining balance method of depreciation, permitted under this Code, but before we get into that method and how it operates, I'd like to pick up counsel's answers to questions put late yesterday by Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.468" offset="289207">I know that the counsel for the Government, when asked whether the elimination of capital gains, was the real issue here, answered that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.270" offset="332466">But he's apparently unaware that the Government has, on three different occasions, admitted that the elimination of capital gains was its objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.061" offset="379591">First of those, that I do want to call the Court's attention to, appears in the Government's brief in Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.000" offset="411355">The Government stated at page 11 of that brief, the question, in this case, bears upon the proper computation or determination of capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.162" offset="455973">In the Government's opening brief in the Third Circuit below, in the -- in this Hertz case, the Government said at page 40 of that brief, “The simple fact is that the profit is taxable at capital gains rates and taxpayer, under its view, receives the benefit of a deduction at a 52% rate and pays tax on the profit resulting from the increased deduction at a 25% rate."</text>
            <text syncTime="112.729" offset="554297">This result can be avoided by defining useful life for purposes of depreciation as meaning, the period during which an asset is useful to the taxpayer together with a reasonable computation of salvage value.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.845" offset="606751">This has been done by Section 1.167 (a)-1 (b) of the regulations referring to the 1956 regulations under the 1954 Code.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="137.702" offset="654190">Mr. Bernhard, what were you reading from this time?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edgar_bernhard" startTime="140.028" stopTime="145.146">
            <label>Mr. Edgar Bernhard</label>
            <text syncTime="140.028" offset="663489">I was reading from the Third Circuit brief by the -- filed by the Government below in this case.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="145.146" stopTime="147.308">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="145.146" offset="683969">All right, thank you.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edgar_bernhard" startTime="147.308" stopTime="632.839">
            <label>Mr. Edgar Bernhard</label>
            <text syncTime="147.308" offset="692642">Third, the Government admits the same point in its brief in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.473" offset="717302">At page 49, it lays stress on the point that the deductions are taken at a 52% rate, whereas, the capital gain rate established by the Congress is 25%.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.306" offset="764635">And fourth, the Undersecretary of the Treasury, this month, appeared before the House Ways and Means Committee, in behalf of new legislation in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.753" offset="814373">He was asking, he said, for legislation which would “eliminate the opportunity which now exists of converting ordinary gain into capital -- ordinary income into capital gain”.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.018" offset="871424">He told about the workings of depreciation, particularly under the double declining balance method and the fact that, as he said, under present law, taxpayers were entitled to take capital gains on the sale of depreciable assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.373" offset="924818">And on that basis, he asked for statutory change to eliminate capital gains on the sale of depreciable property at least, to the amount of the depreciation taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.398" offset="972988">Just prior to that and the letter which was -- and the -- the incident which was responsible for the calling of those hearings at which the Undersecretary appeared and said what I've just accounted, was a letter dated February 12, 1960, which appears in our brief in this Court at page 53 in the appendix, Appendix A -- our reply brief, I'm sorry, our reply brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.375" offset="1104854">And at the foot of -- of page 53 of -- of the brief, towards the end of the letter, the Secretary of the Treasury, who has, in this letter, asked for special legislation says “The proposed statutory change which would require the gains from sale of depreciable personal property be treated as ordinary income to the extent of depreciation previously claimed, would make it possible for agents of the Internal Revenue Service to accept more readily, taxpayer judgments and taxpayer practices with respect to depreciation rates on salvage value.”</text>
            <text syncTime="289.686" offset="1262111">In other words, the Secretary of the Treasury is really saying to the Congress, “If you will just give us this legislation to cut off capital gains, we can be much more lenient about our definition of useful life.”</text>
            <text syncTime="305.127" offset="1323865">What he really means is that he would then be willing, if capital gains can be eliminated by new legislation, to go back to the 40-year practice and the 40-year definition of useful life, not broken until the 1956 regulations were issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.412" offset="1397008">Now, in view of all that, counsel's answer to that question and I want to take up another answer for just a moment, counsel's answer yesterday is simply not understandable, in view of these forthright statements from the Government that its real purpose is to eliminate capital gains by redefining these basic, long standing concepts of useful life and salvage value.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.359" offset="1500766">Now, the Government also stated to this Court, yesterday, that its practice in the past, in response to a question, its practice in the past was consistent with its position here in these cases, the Evans and Hertz cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.847" offset="1562728">Now, as opposed to all our citations in our briefs to show that this is not the case, the Government's briefs, first of all, answered actually with only one case, the Ludey case, with one sentence from that case which actually is dictum, because the Ludey case, as Your Honors are probably aware, does not deal with useful life, how useful life is to arrived at, the measure of depreciation and the sentence quoted which -- which the -- is the only part of the case that can be quoted at all, that seems at least to have some connection here, is pure dictum as we pointed out in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.309" offset="1752586">And yesterday, in response to a question, counsel for the Government when pressed to name a -- a single case, as we have been asking for the Government to do, a single case prior to the promulgation of the 1956 regulations under the 1954 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.776" offset="1862510">Not in which, it established the -- its new definition of useful life, but in which it contended for and -- in which it contended for any other definition except the one we are espousing in the Evans and Hertz cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.264" offset="1928443">Counsel finally answered with a single case, the Cohn case, 259 F.2d 371, but the difficulty is that this is in the same category with Evans and Hertz.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.091" offset="1987688">It was decided in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.576" offset="2001690">It's subsequent to the 1956 regulations, it does not meet the --the real question here, whether the Government is now changing position entirely or is simply following up with its past practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.036" offset="2055502">Now, I -- I wonder what the Government has to say today about its rulings, its repeated interpretations of useful life in case after case, and in its own Bulletin “F”, which came up yesterday and which I should like to bring up again in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.680" offset="2118092">But as to the cases, in Merkle Broom Company and I can -- I can do each of these in just a second or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.049" offset="2143587">In Merkle Broom Company, a 1926 case before the Board of Tax Appeals, the taxpayers' holding period was two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.934" offset="2179114">The Government claimed a five-year useful life, the whole physical life of the asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.752" offset="2210356">The Board of Tax Appeals held four years and the Commissioner officially acquiesced.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.027" offset="2239509">In Max Kurtz a year later, 1927, a Board of Tax Appeal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.899" offset="2263019">The holding period, two to three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.980" offset="2275244">The Government claimed a five-year useful life.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.937" offset="2291127">The Board of Tax Appeals held a five-year useful life.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.208" offset="2304188">And, of course, the Commissioner officially acquiesced, the whole physical life despite a shorter period of -- a shorter holding period known.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.084" offset="2343685">In Sanford Cotton Mills, 1929 case, holding period, two and a half years, Government claimed five-year useful life.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.327" offset="2392691">Board of Tax Appeals held four-year useful life and the Commissioner officially acquiesced, to move along to present day or almost present day, 1956, although there other cases and our -- our briefs present them, in 1956, Pilot Freight Carriers, 15 CCH T.C.Mem.1027, holding period, 32 to 36 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.750" offset="2522363">The Government claimed five years and six years useful life, two kinds of assets, tractors and another kind of vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.887" offset="2562905">The other cases were automobile cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="4344.267" offset="17480391">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.368" offset="17484884">In the -- in the Massey case, the -- the record, I believe, shows that Massey was a dealer in cars, not through of Evans or Hertz, that he, from time to time, shifted cars, which he owned as a dealer, into car renting or leasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.537" offset="17557504">And then shifted them back or sold them, let's say after a six-month period or shortly thereafter and there is no such indication in either Evans or Hertz, plus the fact that he consistently sold the cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.363" offset="17620825">I think the Court will find consistently sold the cars for more than his cost and the -- the dealer question is very much in the -- in the Massey case as it is now.</text>
