            <label>Mr. E. Smythe Gambrell</label>
            <text syncTime="11.244" offset="44931">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.152" offset="48588">I'm advised that I have about ten minutes and I hope in that time to cover some six or eight points that I ought to comment on here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.379" offset="81502">May I start out by saying that it is our position that all three of the forms are relief granted by the trial court in this case, that is the declaratory judgment, the monetary judge -- monetary judgments, and the injunction are appropriate in form and are amply supported by the findings of the trial judge and by the evidence in this case and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.920" offset="199680">And therefore, we do seek the affirmance of the judgement and decree of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.107" offset="256418">Yesterday, some question was raised about the difference between collection and expenditure and the nature of those two incidents of this whole proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.782" offset="319112">It is our position that the collection of the dues and the making of the expenditures for the various challenged purposes constitute just one integrated process, so far as the appellees are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.880" offset="383478">It's all a part of the required membership in the unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.432" offset="413675">We say that it is the membership which the union-shop agreement compels and not the collection of moneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.702" offset="466756">My clients are required to be members and in order to get to be members, they have to pay their dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.797" offset="495177">All of it is one package.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.275" offset="513045">That membership compelled by government action, takes money away from my clients and also makes it available to the unions for legitimate expenditures or for further expenditures which they may appropriate it to without authority, or in abuse of their authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.576" offset="610220">In other words, it's all in one package and we do not subscribe to the thought that the collection could be legal and the expenditure -- I mean that they can be separated as to a point of legality.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.186" offset="664660">They all come together and we want -- we insist that they be treated together.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.845" offset="707291">Suppose the contract itself is within the statute as written and suppose the dues collected are within the statute as written, do you believe that we should strike the statute down, because of the possibility of someone violating it in the future?</text>

            <text syncTime="223.608" offset="894328">We say that that is unconstitutional and should be stopped on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.333" offset="917316">We do not have before us a case of where this statute was administered strictly along collective bargaining lines, Your Honor.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Smythe Gambrell</label>
            <text syncTime="250.435" offset="1001639">They have shown a legislative history and they have shown the conduct of Congress over this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.954" offset="1039778">And they have shown many other things which they've documented very completely where Congress has refused, when reminded of the abuses, Congress has refused to do anything to ameliorate it or correct it or, to more specifically, narrow the functions down to what we claim are the proper functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.568" offset="1126191">I want particularly to mention another subject which came up yesterday and that had to do with whether or not, the Hanson case passed upon the requirement of membership in addition to the payment of dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.943" offset="1191706">I rechecked the record last night in the Hanson case, because I wanted to be on solid ground, technically and otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.026" offset="1228069">And I find that in the Hanson case, it was admitted by the attorneys for the other side that there was not, in this case, any question of compulsory -- I mean in the Hanson case, any question of compulsory membership raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.540" offset="1318139">Mr. Justice Black asked the question at page 59 and 60 of the transcript in the Hanson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.626" offset="1354501">He says, “Does this relieve him from being compelled to subscribe to such an association as that?</text>
            <text syncTime="344.677" offset="1378638">If you don't want to see whether it does or does not, is that question raised here?”</text>
            <text syncTime="351.370" offset="1405388">And Mr. Schoene says, "I think it definitely is not raised here, Mr. Justice Black."</text>
            <text syncTime="356.646" offset="1426495">That is commented upon on page 8 of our December 20th -- 29th brief and at page 80 of our December 29th brief and is covered very -- very fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.830" offset="1479262">And it shows that -- and of course, the decision in the Hanson case says that, "It decides only that in effect, the members shall not be or the employees shall not pre writers."</text>
            <text syncTime="386.333" offset="1545300">It -- the language of course is not that, but it says, "It's narrowed solely to the matter of making them pay their part of the financial load in collective bargaining."</text>
            <text syncTime="397.499" offset="1589917">So, I would like to correct or clear -- clear my statement of yesterday and say that we do not believe the Hanson case ever intended or did pass upon or approve compulsory membership because, as was said at page 8 and page 80 of our most recent brief, it was not even dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.449" offset="1681763">And of course in addition to that, it was clear in the Hanson case, as admitted by Mr. Schoene, reported on page 6 of our brief, the question of use of money for political purposes was not raised by the pleadings in the Hanson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.182" offset="1756682">So for two reasons, we would say the Hanson case would not be authority to say that in this case, our clients or the class could be bound to be members of a union doing such as admittedly is done here, practicing all forms of politics, legislative politics and electioneering politics and such matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.471" offset="1865874">I wanted to get that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.632" offset="1874442">Now, something was said by Mr. Schoene about there being no question that there was no ideology, no indoctrination program in this case that no contention had been made to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.050" offset="1948108">That is strictly in error, because we have developed that at great length in our briefs and, of course, all the literature which we had to buy from them if we were members and the provisions of their charters and bylaws are all headed in the direction of particular doctrinaires, which were constantly put in our hands and put upon us.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.595" offset="2062315">And so, that is one of the big phases of the cases, not only the spending of money to elect people.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.431" offset="2085721">Not only the spending of money to get legislation, but the spending of money as you'll see in accordance with their principles as stated in their charters and bylaws, all of which are in the record show that they are seeking, that this group act has a class and make its presence felt as a class thinking along certain lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.717" offset="2170776">They even went so far as to say, that the Congress ought to be authorized to overrule the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.210" offset="2196793">I'm not mentioning it just because it relates to this body, but there are many things in there concerning which my clients might have some disinclination to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.461" offset="2233783">And all of that is a part of the general program, which is constantly put before and in the hands of our clients and then assisted upon, in connection with the associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.664" offset="2286655">Some point was made yesterday about the majority having a right in a compulsory union to accept the policy, of course, that's not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.761" offset="2326988">Involuntary organizations, the majority can rule but when they seek the cloak of federal authority and when they go into the arena of politics, naturally, every man is harboring of himself in matters of politics and in matters of election, and the majority was never intended to rule there.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.875" offset="2419461">It was also said that -- yesterday that my clients have complete freedom to do what they wanted, to practice their politics, all they've got to do is to pay their money in and then go do what they please.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.404" offset="2477558">That wasn't said in the case of Jehovah's Witnesses, where people salute -- were required to salute a flag even though they could go and salute a hundred other flags a minute later.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.037" offset="2516114">I believe my time is up.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.925" offset="2523638">Thank you.</text>

          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="633.972" stopTime="636.283">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="633.972" offset="2535863">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>

          <turn speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="636.283" stopTime="874.310">
            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="636.283" offset="2545058">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.396" offset="2569509">The United States thinks there is a distinct difference between the expenditure of this money and the collection of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.652" offset="2606602">It adheres to the position that I tried to present yesterday that the statute provides for the payment of these dues under a contract that the statute permits or provides for and that the -- it is contemplated, implied in the statute that those dues will only be used for lawful and proper purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.345" offset="2709316">We think that the cases cited by counsel for the appellees are not in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.475" offset="2745887">Where they say that there's a burden upon interstate commerce and the cases that they refer to either by reason of a licence or by reason of a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.709" offset="2790818">And there, this Court has approved an injunction against that burden on interstate commerce, because it -- the collection of a tax itself, is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.453" offset="2845780">This case is entirely different from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.152" offset="2856542">This is a case where the payment of the funds is contemplated to be lawful in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.847" offset="2887367">And it's -- it is the expenditure that can be questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.649" offset="2902518">It is more like the cases where a state has the power to tax an individual under the general tax power for various purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.441" offset="2945672">And the tax is collected and then misapplied and then, you can enjoin the misapplication under various state constitutions because of that misapplication.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.728" offset="3002828">But you can't keep from paying the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.562" offset="3014217">You can't enjoin the collection of the tax and we think that is the distinction in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.386" offset="3041489">Furthermore, the United States' position, I want to make it very clear in this case is that there is no constitutional question in this case that the Court should reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.137" offset="3092480">That the facts are not so developed in this record, that those questions are finally presented to the Court in a manner that you need them and that you require in -- under your cases for a determination of constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.916" offset="3167608">You do not decide constitutional questions until they are both right and they have to be decided so that in this case, the -- a decree should be reversed and sent down -- sent back for further consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.948" offset="3231765">Now, the problem that I have -- I think I can illustrate somewhat from the record in regard to the extent of these expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.430" offset="3265620">The questions was asked to me in regard to what I consider a peripheral expenditure, one of the most extreme that is in regard to direct contributions to a political campaign, the activity -- legislative activities and many of those and the maintenance of the union, all of those the United States think are generally a very large part, would be perfectly lawful in proper expenditures of this money on behalf of the union activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.570" offset="3398217">Now the -- we cannot tell from this record whether there was even one cent contributed to this particular type of activity and it certainly shouldn't be passed upon by this Court as a constitutional question, unless you can at least find from the record that someone contributed at least one cent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1470.353" offset="5881313">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.236" offset="5900852">During the discussions yesterday, there were a number of references from both sides of the bench, I think perhaps inadvertent, to assessments being made for political uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.241" offset="5972950">I think I made it clear in my original argument that we are not here concerned with any assessments of any sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.405" offset="6013597">So far as this record shows, none of the defendant unions has ever made any assessment for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.102" offset="6048392">The expenditures that we are concerned with here are expenditures from general union funds derived from various sources, including initiation fees and dues, but also including returns on investments of accumulated funds and other items of income of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.101" offset="6164376">In any event to the extent that members under a union-shop contribute to those funds, the contributions involved are only the regular initiation fees and dues uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or maintaining membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.419" offset="6253610">Now, I think it's particularly important to bear that in mind, because in a question addressed to Mr. Kramer yesterday, Mr. Justice Black closed, a hypothetical situation of a statute of Congress levying a special tax for the purpose of raising funds to support one political party or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.430" offset="6357682">In order to make that question analogous to any issue in this case, the special tax would have to be eliminated and the question posed relate to an appropriation out of the general revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.474" offset="6421838">Now, I would still think that such an appropriation was invalid, but I think not because of the First Amendment, but because it would exceed the function or the purposes enumerated in the Constitution for which Congress has authority to appropriate money, broad as those purposes are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.796" offset="6499161">In other words, that would be analogous to an ultra vires expenditures on the part of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.463" offset="6533851">And as I also pointed out yesterday, there is no claim of expenditures ultra vires the constitution and bylaws of the union or in violation of federal or state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.403" offset="6601561">Now Mr. Gambrell also referred in his argument, if I understood him correctly, to the unions disciplining their members to think as the union thinks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.405" offset="6657567">I think those were the -- approximately the words he used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.835" offset="6671256">Now, nothing of that sort is involved in this case, as a matter of fact, under Section 2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act and the terms of the union-shop agreements here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.027" offset="6720052">The agreement may not be applied to anyone to whom membership is not available or if they are on the same terms and conditions as generally applicable, or for whom membership is denied or terminated for any reason other than his failure to pay the periodic dues, fees, and assessments uniformly required as a condition of maintaining membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.958" offset="6847739">Similarly now, Mr. Gambrell this morning, spoke of the publications that are forced upon these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.431" offset="6897685">Well, they're not forced upon and they don't have to look at them, they -- this is like saying, the Postmaster General forces the junk mail that is delivered to my mailbox on me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.241" offset="6944914">Any of these people were free to do with union publications exactly what I do with the junk mail.</text>

            <text syncTime="2192.828" offset="8771291">I bring also to your attention a portion of the brief amicus filed by the AFFL-CIO, beginning at page 14 of that brief, which contents are very splendid, historical documentation of the activities of rail -- of labor unions in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.814" offset="8867213">It shows that before the nation was even founded, before we had a Constitution, Labor unions in this country are traditionally always engaged in activities other than strictly confined to the negotiation and administration of rates of pay in terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.653" offset="8970553">It has always been necessary for them in order to protect their very existence, in order to provide conditions under which they can function effectively to engage in legislative and political activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2256.438" offset="9025724">Of course Mr. Schoene, before the -- before the union-shop, none of those activities would've been solved or brought up any of the constitutional claims here involved.</text>

          <turn speaker="lester_p_schoene" startTime="2265.898" stopTime="2452.372">
            <label>Mr. Lester P. Schoene</label>
            <text syncTime="2265.898" offset="9063549">That -- that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.724" offset="9070864">Now, we have shown, however, and have quoted from this Court's opinion in Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company against the NLRB 338 U.S. at page 362, recognition by this Court, that the union-shop and the closed shop also are traditional, historic instruments of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.578" offset="9206282">They, no less than the activities of unions, antedate the nation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.509" offset="9254034">Now, I realized Mr. Justice Stewart that that combination, in and off itself, does not raise the issues that are tendered here, but that the combination, plus the statute is what gives rise to the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.685" offset="9350687">But what I'm suggesting to you is that in the application and interpretation of the Constitution, you can't treat the Constitution itself in the abstract either, what has been traditional, historic function of labor organizations both with respect to the activities in which they engage and with respect to the kind of agreements that they make, must certainly be relevant to whether the First Amendment rights are violated when Congress permits a union-shop agreement to be made and says, "We are hereby preempting this field and irrespective of state law, we are permitting union-shop agreements to be made."</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.624" offset="9566459">Surely, this whole course of history antedating the nation itself, is relevant to whether that permission on the part of Congress and the negotiation of a traditional type of labor agreement, plus engaging in the activities that unions have engaged in for centuries, violates any First Amendment rights.</text>
