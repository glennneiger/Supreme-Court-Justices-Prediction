            <text syncTime="54.666" offset="322017">If the -- if the Court please, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.157" offset="339989">This is a proceeding under Section 2255 of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.280" offset="360469">The petitioner in this case is an inmate of the United States penitentiary of Leavenworth, Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.322" offset="384711">In the very brief statement of the background of the various convictions I think would be pertinent at the outset and then discuss his contentions in a later time.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.129" offset="443852">In 1954, the petitioner was indicted in three separate indictments in the District of Maryland and he entered a plea of guilty to all three of the indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.582" offset="485752">The first indictment was for bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.559" offset="497560">He received a sentence of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.089" offset="507695">The second indictment was under the Dyer Act, he received a sentence of five years for that to run concurrently with the 20 year-sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.625" offset="541863">The third indictment was for robbery under the jurisdictional -- jurisdiction of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.909" offset="571016">He received a five-year sentence for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.748" offset="582405">It also ran concurrently with the 20-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.010" offset="599437">So in effect the -- out of the Maryland cases he received a total of 20 years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.203" offset="624201">Now, he was also indicted in the Southern District of New York and in 1955 he entered a plea of guilty in that court to a bank robbery indictment and received a sentence of 20 years there which ran concurrently with the sentence that he previously received in Baltimore.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="149.563" offset="701628">How -- how long previously two years was it something?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_homer_davis" startTime="151.466" stopTime="205.630">
            <label>Mr. Thomas Homer Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="151.466" offset="709256">About two years, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.034" offset="723466">Right after, at the same time he was under indictment in the Eastern District of New York for the robbery of a Veterans Administration Facility at that point and he subsequently entered a plea of guilty to that indictment and that indictment he, under that he received a 12-year sentence to run concurrently with the Baltimore sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.161" offset="820015">Now the case before this Court is the case under the eastern district indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.114" offset="847809">The other two indictments in Baltimore and in the Southern District are incidentally related and it's our contention that they used those sentences to deny this man relief under 2255 and they will be brought into the action incidentally in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.111" offset="919803">Now leading up to the --</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="205.630" offset="925863">Well if you got relief here he'd still be in jail, would he, under those other sentences?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas Homer Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="209.665" offset="942059">That's right, and eventually the question, the only real question I think that is before this Court is going to be the question of whether or not under 2255 he has to be entitled to his -- to immediate release to -- to be his freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.150" offset="1020008">Now --</text>

          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="229.835" stopTime="231.950">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="229.835" offset="1022725">Is there any doubt about that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_homer_davis" startTime="231.950" stopTime="502.079">
            <label>Mr. Thomas Homer Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="231.950" offset="1031189">Well, there is in my mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.988" offset="1039339">I realize that I am against the -- the proposition in this Court under the Hepman case that there is a concurring opinion Mr. Justice Stewart wrote which in effect says and specifically says that there must be a right to immediate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.898" offset="1110915">And in the body of the opinion written by Mr. Justice Douglas, you first arrived at a question of jurisdiction and it was noted there that there was a division in the Court on the question of, in that case whether not the man had to be in custody or not to take advantage of 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.812" offset="1198582">And it's my contention that and I will get to that in the argument of and I think that's the whole sole question really before this Court, but there is another angle to this case which would -- I'd like to dispose of and that is the question that the Government contends that in this man's motion to vacate, he doesn't allege enough grounds or substantial grounds to warrant the court bringing him to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York to testify in his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.644" offset="1345912">That I think is almost -- takes care of itself on the record and I think the court can read the motion and I think its ample but I would like to set out briefly the steps this man went through to come to this question of the release and I think that's the main thing we have to be concerned with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.095" offset="1427728">Now in the first instance, McGann filed a motion -- a motion to vacate and set aside the sentence that was imposed on him in the Eastern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.691" offset="1486137">Now, his contention briefly as to the merits of his contention is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.702" offset="1510170">He contends and if the Court will refer to page 24 of the record that's his second motion to vacate, McGann contended that when he got to New York to await disposition of those two indictments that an assistant -- the court appointed an attorney to represent him in the Southern District case, he contended that this attorney told him that if he would enter a plea of guilty to this indictment in the Southern District, he would see that the sentence imposed upon him was lenient or that the sentence would not interfere with his rights under the Maryland sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.502" offset="1689370">Now the Government in their brief contends that since the 20-year sentence in the District of Maryland was in existence it made no difference about the 20-year sentence in the Southern District or the Eastern District, but they overlooked a point that McGann raises in his motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.404" offset="1768991">McGann has a contention that in the District of Maryland he was charged with robbery of this bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.749" offset="1806399">He was also charged with robbery under the (Inaudible) jurisdiction of the United States and he says that those constitute one offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.522" offset="1845478">He says that he couldn't have robbed the bank and also because this happened to be on Government land, he committed a second robbery under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.059" offset="1875571">He contends that the Government should have elected upon which indictment to charge him.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.640" offset="1901902">When they didn't elect, then when he entered pleas of guilty, the plea of guilty that was imposed under the (Inaudible) Act of only five years is the only good, only good sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.521" offset="1961462">Now, he contends in his motion here that in talking to this assistant United States attorney in the Southern District and later and the Assistant United States Attorney in the Eastern District that he was contending that only the five-year sentence in Maryland was good.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.457" offset="2037217">That if proceeding he then had on file were validated and upheld, he had completely serve the five years and the 20-year sentence wouldn't be in existence and he wouldn't be confronted with this problem of having a 20-year sentence in existence against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.916" offset="2110986">Now he --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="502.079" stopTime="504.390">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="502.079" offset="2111718">When it comes with New York, the 20 years time.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_homer_davis" startTime="504.390" stopTime="669.812">
            <label>Mr. Thomas Homer Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="504.390" offset="2120913">The New York is a 20-year and the Southern District.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.159" offset="2131989">He carries that step further and says that in his contentions now raised on this motion to vacate in the Eastern District that they are tied in with the situation in the Southern District and so tied in that if this would fall the sentence in the Eastern District, likewise the one in the Southern District would fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.488" offset="2217357">Now I -- I realize that the only thing before this Court is the Eastern District sentence and you can anticipate that he is going to be successful in any other actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.455" offset="2265213">But this thing is interwoven and the only reason I'm discussing these two New York cases is to show the Court what his contentions are at this point as to whether or not he alleged enough to warrant that court to produce him in New York to testify in his own behalf on his motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.500" offset="2341386">He says that this east -- Southern District Assistant United States Attorney made this deal with him that it would not interfere with his Baltimore and Maryland sentences and that it was for five years he was contending he was only subject to a sentence under Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.122" offset="2411813">Now he says that he went to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.584" offset="2425710">He refused to enter pleas of guilty until this proposition was placed before to him by Mr. Lizzare the Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.237" offset="2464371">He then says that when this deal was made Lizzare says to him, "Why don't you make the same arrangements with the United States Attorney's Office in the Eastern District?"</text>
            <text syncTime="601.703" offset="2510137">So McGann says, "Well if they all make the same deal in that district I -- I'll do it."</text>
            <text syncTime="609.013" offset="2539395">So Lizzare says I will get in touch with the Assistant United States Attorneys to the Eastern District and they'll come down here and they did come down and the record shows it.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.739" offset="2586311">They came down there the next day and he contends he then had a discussion with Ms. McCann, an Assistant United States Attorney from the Eastern District and she was accompanied by another Assistant United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.864" offset="2650781">He says that they made this same deal with -- he made the same deal with her.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.651" offset="2673977">He says that the deal was, that if he pled guilty they would see that he got a lenient sentence and coupled with that, these promises throughout is the contention he makes that it would not, the sentence he got would not interfere with his Baltimore sentence and that in that connection, he explained to them that he contended he was only subject to five years imprisonment there.</text>

            <text syncTime="947.975" offset="3895254">They heard the case, they denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.187" offset="3904136">He filed a motion for rehearing and that court then said on the motion of pre-hearing, it's denied but without prejudice to filing a second motion on more complete grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.848" offset="3942797">So he turns around and he files a second motion to dismiss and that's on page 24, and it's my contention without counsel, without the advise of counsel, this man has filed this document which is about six -- five pages of printed of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.555" offset="4013641">He designates the first page jurisdictional statements like (Inaudible) but it is his motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.342" offset="4040704">He has a statement of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.282" offset="4048541">In the statement of the case he alleges all these things I've been talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.856" offset="4066826">So it's my contention that his motion contains all these facts of questions and that when then they do, under 2255 as decided in the Hayman case, he should have been produced to that court to testify in support of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.000" offset="4127326">Now I think that's enough on that -- the Court -- it will be obvious to the Court by reading this motion and I think the government's contention is without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.139" offset="4163897">For instance, one thing they had Ms. McCann file affidavits, in the District Court on the first motion, in the District Court on the second motion, in the Circuit Court in the second motion and she sets out in an affidavit denying all these contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.208" offset="4232234">She even goes to the point and she says she's talked to Mr. Lizzare, the assistant from the Southern District and she says he would testify to certain things in an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.864" offset="4270791">They are ex parte affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.547" offset="4281553">Then they say that the Court in denying his motions didn't consider these affidavits but they overlooked a fact in that connection which is hard for me to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.830" offset="4342680">They say the Court didn't consider him -- consider her affidavits on the facts of questions but only incidentally in case the Court arrived at a conclusion that the man was entitled to a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.789" offset="4398477">Now how can you consider something incidentally as a matter of evidence, is something that I don't understand?</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.990" offset="4427316">It's either considered or it isn't considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.865" offset="4438810">So I think they were without merit on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.769" offset="4450408">Now I think the question we got to come to here is this question of the right to be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.398" offset="4476949">The Court is well of course familiar with the Hayman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.426" offset="4493040">2255 was enacted and when it was enacted under the Simon case, the only question, real question before the court there, was the question, as to whether or not he should have been produced to testify on his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.007" offset="4563362">Hayman contended that an attorney appointed for him represented this codefendant without his knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.984" offset="4591261">The District Court conducted a three-day hearing took evidence and denied his motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.093" offset="4615711">The Circuit Court of Appeals when they came to consider the case denied it on the ground that they said 2255 was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.273" offset="4652492">That it was a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.004" offset="4667434">This Court when they reviewed the Hayman, they said that the question of the constitutionality of 2255 was not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.040" offset="4703483">They wouldn't anticipate it and it was not decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.332" offset="4716648">Now same on Circuit Court of Appeals as pointed out in the footnotes to Hayman case has set 2255 is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.126" offset="4751862">The constitutionality of 2255 is not before the Court and this here isn't either, but I've got my contentions in this matter are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.369" offset="4792822">In Hayman the Court said, "Where the motion shows that there are questions not shown on the face of the record" that the petitioner should be produced or could -- there ought to be produced in the court findings of fact and conclusions of the law should be made and he should be brought to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.446" offset="4873174">Now, we come to the next case that this Court's passed on in this section and that is the Heplin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.261" offset="4908387">And in the Heplin case which was decided by this Court in the -- argued in January 14th of 1959 that the Court here had was confronted with is situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.310" offset="4968573">Hayman or Heplin complained that he was charged under the bank robbery statutes and that the sentence imposed -- there were three charges and one was a conspiracy charge, it was tagged on to bottom of the sentence and made to run in the second plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.852" offset="5034820">The Court was considering in the -- in the Heplin case the question of whether or not the man had to be in custody at the time he took advantage and tried to take advantage of 2255.</text>

            <text syncTime="1264.893" offset="5162924">Now, the Court said in that case we have a jurisdictional problem, Justice -- Mr. Justice Douglas said in his opinion, we have a jurisdictional problem we have to dispose of first and that is touched on very briefly in the opinion and he further stated the Court's divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.226" offset="5248293">Now to me I read the concurring opinion written by Mr. Justice Stewart and I see the names of the justices decided in that concurring opinion which means that to me, that the minority on this question was Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice Warren, Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Brennan and the majority were those names in the concurrent opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.333" offset="5348707">Now in this concurrent opinion, Mr. Justice Porter, he goes on and specifically discusses the question that under 2255 you must -- the prisoner must be claiming the right to be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.855" offset="5410774">What my argument to this Court is that it seems to me in the Hayman case and in this case, this Court is saying in substance that this new motion 2255, is nothing more than a substitute for the writ of habeas corpus that you are applying but McNally verus Hill decision in -- under habeas corpus which there must be an immediate right to be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.670" offset="5510040">2255 to me has several different parts to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.840" offset="5530728">The first is that the man must claim the right to be released upon the ground that sentence was in violation of the Constitution, of the laws of United States or, that the court was without jurisdiction to impose the sentence or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.749" offset="5614320">And then this very general ground, or that it is subject to collateral attack, the Court may move to do what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.970" offset="5647235">The court may move to vacate, to set aside -- yes to vacate, to set aside or correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.763" offset="5686418">Now, if you hold that you got to -- a man has the -- he -- have the right to be released, why do you bring him up on 2255 like under the -- you did in the Prince case or in this Bank Act he is not going to be released if you bring him up to the court and say, "The sentence you gave him under bank robbery encompassed all the acts he did and these other terms you got down below where you charged him with taking a hostage and so forth he is under that you reduce -- you hold that part of the sentence is excessive, that man is not released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.144" offset="5843989">He's -- he is under this action, he doesn't have when he files it, he doesn't have, he can't claim the right to be released because he isn't going to be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.039" offset="5879515">His (Inaudible) is going to be corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.217" offset="5888188">Now in this Heplin case you come to Rule 35 in the discussion and you say that he would have been entitled to the benefits of Rule 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.591" offset="5933746">Well Rule 35 under these proceedings there has to be shown on the face of the record that the sentence is illegal and it doesn't go to the question of whether or not these constitutional rights have been violated and there are no cases that I have found that holds no decisions that anything they hold in the record can be considered under 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.587" offset="6029772">So I come to the question why did they pass 2255?</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.409" offset="6048998">If they pass it solely to be a substitute for the writ of habeas corpus then I say, it is -- it's unconstitutional because I don't think you can pass the legislation to take and substitute for the great writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.331" offset="6100720">Now another thing in 2255 the act goes on and it says this, it says that the court can set aside the judgment and shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.208" offset="6172191">Now, have they passed a new legislation that's much broader than we think, they have passed?</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.405" offset="6196955">If they can grab a new trial under 2255, do you have to say that that means they can only grant a new trial when his constitutional rights have been violated?</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.735" offset="6254320">If his be -- if he's granted a new trial under this section and I find no cases on that and I don't see where they've done it, if he is give the right to a new trial, how can you say that he is -- must have a right, a claim to be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.244" offset="6324328">I think that this 2255 is so much broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.775" offset="6342510">Now in Hayman they say it's as broad as habeas corpus and habeas corpus -- it was passed to give the same rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.664" offset="6369991">They say it's broader than coram nobis, but then in Hayman they also say, "It's an independent action" that this Court has said that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1584.074" offset="6439685">So I think that if this Court has to interpret 2255 to be a substitute for the writ of habeas corpus, I -- I don't think that this can be done because the constitutionality is not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.136" offset="6511888">But I personally have never thought 2255 was constitutional for a lot of reasons, but one is that you put a different standard on a prisoner, a man serving a federal sentence, he is put under a different situation than any other American citizen.</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.615" offset="6773844">You're going to say, the statute says this, that when you file the action to that court if there effects that warrant the Court looking into it, the Court shall determine the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.364" offset="6836851">Not that you should determine the issues at -- you have a hearing, a judicial hearing it says.</text>

            <text syncTime="1693.123" offset="6875826">Now if you're going to interpret the statute that the Court must look at this and see whether he is correcting the sentence whether he is going to vacate it, whether he is claiming the same thing he does under habeas corpus instead of solving anything or simplifying anything it looks to me like you are making this more cumbersome and more burdensome than you have under habeas corpus.</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.053" offset="8075577">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.313" offset="8092609">It's the Government's position that the first issue which is whether the collateral attack remedy under 2255 is applicable in this situation is the primary issue in this case and that we never really arrived at the question of whether the second issue which is whether or not in the context of all the problems, this petitioner has alleged sufficient facts to warrant a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.718" offset="8226252">Now briefly, insofar as the factual picture is concerned, counsel has outlined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.825" offset="8258644">We'd like to say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.577" offset="8269720">We feel that not only because of the statute, the 2255, we think that this goes even much further than the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.831" offset="8310680">We say this, that if a petitioner has a 20-year sentence in Maryland to serve and a concurrent sentence of 20 years in the Southern District of New York to serve, that under any circumstance and regardless of what the claim is or regardless of how it arrived, this Court nor any other court should on collateral attack listen to a contention which will only involve the 12-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.085" offset="8451741">And the reason we say this is because in a long line of cases this Court as well as many Courts of Appeal on direct attack, not collateral but in direct review of sentences have many times held in multiple count cases when you get 20 or 30 counts that once this Court, once this Court has found that the conviction let's say of 20 years is supported by one good count, this Court will not go into the multiple problems involved in the numerous other counts of an indictment in which a petitioner either is a general sentence or concurrent sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.915" offset="8643062">Now we think that this situation is analogous here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.558" offset="8657586">In other words, instead of the possibly unique problem of having a person sentenced in three different districts, this petitioner had received all of his sentences in one district such as Maryland, he would have received concurrent sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.594" offset="8745775">He'd be under the same condition he is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.665" offset="8762075">In that proceeding, this Court nor that court nor any Court of Appeals that we have found would consider on collateral attack, would never consider solely the 12-year sentence which this petitioner is contesting in this case.</text>
