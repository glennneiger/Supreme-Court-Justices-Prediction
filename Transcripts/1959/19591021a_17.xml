            <text syncTime="16.926" offset="171029">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.744" offset="186389">The petitioner contends in this cause if by no stretch of existing law on the subject can the known facts to the agents at the time they stopped the motor vehicle constitute probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.090" offset="251695">Now, the Government takes an erroneous comfort in the use of the word “implicate” as to the defendant Pierotti out of four meanings in Webster and they have utilized Webster to define this word, they have ignored the innocent connotations of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.818" offset="326614">It is felt that Pierotti on these facts is entitled to this meaning to involve in the nature or operation of something and that is to say on the facts that Pierotti was employed as a dockman for a concerned which was involved in the transshipment of the -- of articles in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.038" offset="415535">Now, what is the authority of a federal agent under the statute to arrest without warrant?</text>
            <text syncTime="84.664" offset="442075">The section which is quoted in the brief says that “An agent may arrest or any felony cognizable under the laws of the United States if they have reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing such felony.”</text>
            <text syncTime="105.295" offset="524518">Now, the elements are, one, that it must be a federal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.170" offset="544057">How could the two agents in observing what the petitioner and his codefendant were doing on the streets of Chicago in broad daylight, merely moving cartons which were unrecognizable in any shape conclude that a federal offense was being committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.731" offset="626291">Moreover, it must be a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.616" offset="633814">Now these cartons were not large, they were before the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.323" offset="652622">I venture to say that the question of the value of $100 enters into the picture because certainly if what they have in those cartons was of a value of less than $100, we would have no felony.</text>

            <text syncTime="665.880" offset="2766869">Now, there is absolutely no evidence that the cartons that were placed in there were ever removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.414" offset="2789021">There is no examination of the car at any point and they talk about delivery of merchandise to a liquor store.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.078" offset="2811695">There is no evidence of any delivery of those cartons.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.283" offset="2824547">Even assuming there were empty beer bottles going back to a tavern, which they weren't and which there's no evidence of, I see nothing suspicious in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.109" offset="2863835">The other theory that the petitioner makes in this case is that there's been an improper interpretation of the so-called presumption, the unexplained possession of recently stolen goods will authorize conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.802" offset="2918588">Very briefly, it is the petitioner's contention that the facts alone explain his possession such as it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.716" offset="2954219">He was a passenger in a vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.948" offset="2963205">There isn't any quest that he met Pierotti by a chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.489" offset="2973341">There is no evidence that he knew these were stolen or anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.183" offset="2988074">The car was borrowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.704" offset="2994239">He was in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.678" offset="2998105">He was in it when the car was stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.698" offset="3006151">And I don't think that the law requires that the defendant take the stand and do at which he's already done by his plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.838" offset="3034676">The circumstances alone explain and are just as reasonable so far as his innocence is concern as they are with guilt and I think under those circumstances that on the motion for judgment of the acquittal, they court below should have find him not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.105" offset="3107819">For all these reasons and two points, the petitioner respectfully urges that the decisions of the court below be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="768.375" offset="3176887">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.670" offset="3190053">There's one thing I would like to clear up at the outset of my remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.823" offset="3206666">A question was asked yesterday, I believe by you, Mr. Chief Justice, as to whether or not there is any difference in the position of the Government and the petitioner as to time the arrest took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.530" offset="3261524">The answer is no, there is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.091" offset="3279705">I might explain just exactly how that came about because it is of importance as the to the Government's position generally in similar cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.811" offset="3318575">In this case, the petitioner contended throughout, has contended throughout and from the beginning that the arrest took place at the time the car was stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.570" offset="3365700">Now, there's nothing in the record below to indicate that that position was taken by the Government except on the opinion, in the Court of Appeals, the dissenting judge mentioned that the Government Attorney in the course of oral argument conceded that the arrest took place at the time the car was stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.818" offset="3458696">When the case came to this Court on our brief in opposition, we adhered to that concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.105" offset="3487744">We felt obliged to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.317" offset="3496626">At the same time, we indicated doubt as to the propriety of the concession and we have reiterated that position on our brief on the merits in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.764" offset="3542392">So -- so far as this case is concerned, the arrest took place at the time the car was stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.698" offset="3574157">We have indicated and I think we should state at this time very briefly, what we think that law is generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.795" offset="3602578">We do not think that merely stopping a car for questioning of the occupants constitutes an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.819" offset="3630686">There must be more.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.914" offset="3639045">There must be an intent to take a person in question into custody to answer for a crime, answer in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.138" offset="3675930">Since an arrest is more than merely stopping of a car, it takes more to justify an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.785" offset="3702471">It takes probable cause to justify an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.882" offset="3714905">Merely stopping the car we say, speaking of the law generally, that it is only necessary that the action of the officers be reasonable under all the circumstances of the case in stopping the individual whether he'd be in a vehicle or not and questioning him as to the possible commission of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.045" offset="3795571">Now, that question will be presented to Your Honors in a later case, Number 52, Rios, which is coming up this term and I mention it -- for that reason, separate key (Inaudible) for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.946" offset="3847189">We, the concession which we thought obliged to adhere to in this case, applies only to this case and does not state position of the Government generally.</text>

            <text syncTime="2180.323" offset="8824665">That was that this was a tavern which was only six blocks from the scene of the theft and it was a place which could be at least a possible outlet for the stolen merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.788" offset="8878477">Fourth was the fact that indirect course was followed in reaching us out and Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, you correctly pointed out what the nature of that indirection was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.664" offset="8934066">It was simply that they passed up the right alley went by and had to come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.463" offset="8953187">Now, that itself again is not decisive, but it shows an unfamiliar act with the premise where all the facts taken together might indicate that they were carrying something back and forth or something going back to the tavern, and I would think it's empty beer bottle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.457" offset="9029151">I don't believe they take empty beer bottles according to my information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.013" offset="9043466">But if it was liquor, then it -- and he would think and they were engaged in picking it up from a licensed place to deal in liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.712" offset="9078262">You think they would know where to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.710" offset="9086203">If it was an ordinary business transaction, it's something a little bit out of the ordinary because they were unfamiliar with the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.351" offset="9112743">Now a fifth thing is, their conduct when they got in to the south as I have indicated, there was no wholesale liquor dealer at that point with residential premises located at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.061" offset="9175646">And this was not a commercial vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.827" offset="9186722">It was a passenger vehicle in which the cartons were being loaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.275" offset="9212426">Now, it's been suggested that it might have been groceries that was going back there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.639" offset="9241893">I don't see any reason to believe the groceries would be picked up, a place where a grocery store is not shown to have existed, taking back the bar specially when the -- there are two trips here it would seem that what was being picked up here if anything would be the kind of merchandise that that bar was licensed in allowing to deal in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.397" offset="9352965">Then seventh I believe in the -- six I should mention, I have failed to mention sir, is the return to the redtop tavern, which is a possible but not necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.555" offset="9413569">The only outlet for stolen merchandise (Inaudible) but impossible outlet and then in (Inaudible) is the return here and again, this rather clandestine picking up of some kind of cargo which they can't identify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.782" offset="9474487">Well, how far must officers of the law go before they had in cases like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.263" offset="9508446">It's recognized as I've said that you can't -- you can't get a search warrant that even the more restrictive you've taken by members of the Court is the need for a search warrant whenever it's reasonably possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.264" offset="9556407">It's recognized that in the case of moving vehicles, you cannot get it because the merchandise will be out of the way by the time the search warrant is obtained.</text>
