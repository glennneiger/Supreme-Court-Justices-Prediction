            <label>Mr. Eugene L. Grimm</label>
            <text syncTime="20.687" offset="186075">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.709" offset="206242">This case presents an undecided question as to the interpretation of the Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U.S.C. 3731, regarding jurisdiction over the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.210" offset="260263">If the merits are reached, the question is one of the constructions to be place upon certain customs regulations published by the Treasury Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.159" offset="304044">In this case, appellees were charge by information with violating 19 U.S.C. 1304 which requires that articles imported from foreign land be marked with their country of origin and that such marking be maintained until sale of the article to ultimate purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.815" offset="402683">The District Court dismissed the information on the ground that a Treasury Decision requiring that articles imported from East Germany be marked “Germany Soviet occupied” do not require such making for the purposes of 1304, that is the marking statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.778" offset="482513">On Appeal by the Government, the Court of Appeals concluded that the appeal should have been taken to this Court in the first instance since it regarded the construction of the administrative regulation as the construction of a statute within the meaning of Criminal Appeals Act and concluded that in any event, the order sustaining the motion to dismiss was an order sustaining a motion in bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.515" offset="593481">It therefore certified the case to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.406" offset="608946">The Government thinks this case was properly appealed to the Court of Appeal in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.761" offset="642382">Cases of course coming here by certificate are fairly unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.280" offset="664534">If I may go rather quickly over the operative facts, the information in this case alleged that between August 1956 and March 1957, the appellees had purchase a certain violins from importers.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.810" offset="730572">Now, at the time they purchased these violins, the violins had been imported from East Germany and they bore label showing that they had been imported from Germany, Soviet occupied or U.S.S.R. occupied.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.730" offset="798281">It was the allegation in the information that the appellees had obliterated and removed these labels and there after sold the violins to someone who was not an ultimate purchaser without disclosing the fact that they have been imported from East Germany and of course, there was a theory of this information that this act on the part of the appellees intentionally done was a violation of the marking statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.447" offset="909145">Now, the statute itself requires that every article of foreign origin be marked with the name of the country of origin and the country of origin, that phrase has been defined by appropriate regulation as political entity known as a nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.022" offset="979466">Here, let me say of course that the marking statute provides that the Secretary of Treasury may issue regulations establishing just what marking maybe put on various imported articles to indicate specific country from which it came.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.132" offset="1051878">So, as I said at the first regulation which is our concern here, defines country of origin as a political entity known as a nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.060" offset="1099630">Immediately or shortly after World War II in 1946, the Treasury Department permitted articles manufactured in all four zones of Germany to be marked as “made in Germany.”</text>
            <text syncTime="264.164" offset="1160025">And this regulation further provided that the specific zone of manufacture could be indicated if thought desirable by the importer.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.371" offset="2420903">In dismissing the information, the District Court considered the statute and these regulations and also an affidavit from defense counsel to the effect that appellees have marked the offending violins as “made in Germany.”</text>
            <text syncTime="594.499" offset="2481403">The Court concluded that regulations require different marking on articles from East and West Germany only for the purposes of imposing the proper duty and not for the purpose of implementing the marking statute 1304.</text>

            <text syncTime="632.336" offset="2632704">That is the paragraph beginning articles manufactured or produced in the Federal Republic of Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.418" offset="2661021">Now, on Appeal by the Government it was also held that the regulation was too vague and indefinite to sustain a criminal prosecution also.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.005" offset="2699368">On Appeal by the Government to the Second Circuit, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court's opinion construing the regulation was tantamount to a construction of the statute upon which the information was founded and that the order of dismissal was that appealable directly to this Court under the Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.150" offset="2779930">It said, when Congress used the term statute in Section 3731, that is the Criminal Appeals Act, it did so in the broad sense and meant to include all that could have the force of law from the exercise of the powers which Congress may have granted as part of -- part of the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.349" offset="2860805">The Court of Appeals was also of the opinion that the dismissal of the information amounted to an order sustaining a motion in bar since the fact of the order end the cause and exculpate the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.367" offset="2920887">Now, as to the question of jurisdiction, we think the court – that the Court of Appeals would have proper forum for this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.477" offset="2953279">We believe the word statute as used in the Criminal Appeals Act means Act of Congress and not administrative regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.995" offset="2991313">Although of course, as the basic premise administrative regulation have the force of law, but the none -- it nonetheless remains true that as to any specific statutory Act done by Congress, it's necessary to look at the context in which the words have been used to determine whether the statute as used in that particular piece of legislation also includes administrative regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.661" offset="3113984">We think that, since so far as the Criminal Appeals Act is concerned, the word statute should be read narrowly so as not to apply to administrative regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.659" offset="3162049">Now, there are a number of reasons for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.389" offset="3176887">First of all, administrative regulation, although they have the force of law are subordinate to the laws themselves that is the law passed by Congress and this status of subordination has been consistently maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.082" offset="3243656">For example, only Congress may impose a criminal penalty for violation of a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.965" offset="3267271">Only Congress may declare the policy as to what type of conduct may be punished or established under what circumstances a particular Act shall be criminal or established criteria to aid or to govern the issue into administrative regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.992" offset="3343339">And continued prosecution depends upon the continued life of a basic statute, that is absent from savings clause whereas revocation of a regulation does not have this effect, that is the affect of terminating prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.562" offset="3401644">So, that in the end, the regulation, no matter how sweeping they maybe, must find their justification within the basic statue which authorizes their issuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.533" offset="3453471">With these considerations in mind then that the regulation is subordinate to the Act of Congress and that there may well be a real difference, a look at 18 U.S.C. 3731 that is the Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.129" offset="3523897">The provision in the Criminal Appeals Act for direct review here on -- at the request of the Government has always been narrowly construed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.636" offset="3573948">It's always been construed, so to deny Supreme Court jurisdiction when it is reasonably possible to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.987" offset="3603310">And there's a -- there's a reason for this, it has been said that in one aspect at least, the history of this Court is the progressive contraction of mandatory review.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.405" offset="3657017">Obviously, Congress has a -- had to keep the work within capability of the nine judges sitting here and so, we've always seen a gradual withdrawal of provisions for automatic review.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.030" offset="3727444">Now, the Criminal Appeals Act runs counter to this trend of the year and perhaps because of this and perhaps because of other reasons such as the reason that an appeal by the Government is not usually favored.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.262" offset="3788466">This Court has always narrowly construed the Criminal Appeals Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1772.931" offset="7195146">To go back to the background here, in 1946 the Treasury Department had said, “Well, you can mark products emanating from all four zones as made in Germany.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.986" offset="7243316">In 1949 however, the western zones refused and we've permitted that Federal Republic of Germany to come into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.071" offset="7275708">And from that moment on at least, the Russian zone of Germany stood on a different footing from the other zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.320" offset="7304652">In 1951, Congress and the President acted in this customs field to show that the Soviet zone stood on a separate footing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1945.225" offset="7884257">This case is here presumably under provisions of Section 3731 of the Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.391" offset="7920933">Now that section says nothing about the jurisdiction of this Court reviewing a determination of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.505" offset="7961370">Under that section, the Appeal lies directly from the District Court to this Court and only when the Government makes a mistake and Appeals to the Court of Appeals, then the Court of Appeals takes a sort of conduit, just certifies the case directly to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.198" offset="8044126">Now, I respectfully submit that the Government wanted a review of the determination of the Court of Appeals it should have proceeded by writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.541" offset="8085504">Apparently, they thought so too that in the beginning they got an extension of time, 30 days and abandoned the idea and waited until the case was certified here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.888" offset="8122911">Now, under the question of jurisdiction, we respectfully submit again this -- I don't know how this case got here for review by the Court of Appeals determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.513" offset="8161468">If this Court should take jurisdiction and considered the decision of the Court of Appeals, may I submit that the opinion clearly establishes that the Government's position was sustained an absurd result would be accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.404" offset="8240985">We would have a situation where regulation is appealable to the Court of Appeals and statute as appealable to the United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.784" offset="8286542">Moreover, as is pointed out in that opinion before 1942 when the Court of Appeals didn't have specific jurisdiction set forth in 3731, an appeal could have taken here directly from the District Court where a determination was made involving the construction of the statute, but if there were an administrative regulation involved, there was no fault to take an appeal because there was no --</text>
