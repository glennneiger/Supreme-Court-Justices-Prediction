            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="25.368" offset="204884">Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.138" offset="223901">This case involves a simple question on the application of the Safety Appliance Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.127" offset="259845">Specifically, the issue here is whether the air brake requirements of that law were required to be followed by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, in its performance of certain terminal operations in Hopewell, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.588" offset="345736">It -- it had an -- on four occasions, moved strings of cars, about 25 cars each, a distance of about two miles in making deliveries to or making pickups from industrial establishments in Hopewell.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.179" offset="432044">And in all of these occasions the air brakes were not connected.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.920" offset="451062">The United States brought suit for civil penalties $100 for each violation, $400 is the total.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.522" offset="493484">Now, although this penalty is small, the issue in this case is of tremendous importance because it affects the -- the lives and the -- the safety of thousands of trainmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.210" offset="544162">When President Harrison asked for this legislation back in 1890, he submitted figures to the Congress that showed that during the year preceding his message, 2450 trainmen had been killed in operating accidents and 22,390 has been injured and of these, in two years, over 1000 had been injured in falls from the tops of cars, which were due, in part, to the use handbrakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.349" offset="684805">One of the Senators, in discussing the legislation, estimated that in the course of eight years, the equivalent of the entire railroad operating force would be killed or injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.569" offset="737677">And so the Congress passed the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.256" offset="752410">And I looked at the reports on safety for the year 1958 and the total of persons killed in operating accidents, trainmen was down to 154.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.930" offset="847078">We -- we can't tell how much.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.076" offset="859721">The general question before the Court is whether this legislation is going to be enforced regarding to its explicit terms of whether the railroad shall be allowed to return in part, at least, to the situation that they were in before the legislation was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.766" offset="926386">Now, the terms of the law which are before us, the questions of law are not difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.477" offset="953240">The statute is set forth -- the statutes are set forth on pages 2 and 3 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.642" offset="977899">The first provision, Section 1 of the Act, was passed in 1893 and it provides for power brakes to be placed on cars, but it provides no specific measure of how -- how many.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.444" offset="1061177">It says instead that they shall be sufficient so that the engineer may control the speed of the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.347" offset="1092733">This proved to be not sufficiently definite and in 1903, it was amended and the provision which is still in effect appears at the bottom of page 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.964" offset="1139231">And in this law, they provided that at least 50% of the -- of the cars should be provided with air brakes, that the Interstate Commerce Commission might after hearing, increase though not decrease, this number.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.864" offset="1202866">And that all other power brake cars, that were part of the train, should be connected.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.114" offset="1227839">So that they were required to carry only 50% with power brakes, but if added cars did have power brakes, they too must be connected.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.632" offset="1265873">And the Interstate Commerce Commission has implemented that by its regulations which appears at the top of page 4, providing that not less than 85% of the cars must have their power brakes connected.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.922" offset="1315088">In -- in actual operating effect, all the brakes -- all the cars must be connected because in effect, all cars do have power brakes and since you are required to connect any that do have them, in effect, all of the brakes -- all of the cars must be connected at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.709" offset="1398157">Now, the facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.080" offset="1407666">The Seaboard Air Line Railroad moved four strings of cars over its yard tracks within the City of Hopewell, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.430" offset="1449044">In each case, there were -- the strings of cars consisted of between 23 and 29 cars and they were moved a distance of two miles in three of the cases and one mile in the fourth without leaving off or picking up any extra cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.228" offset="1524276">These were -- in other words, uninterrupted movements of one or two miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.286" offset="1548518">Now, these movements occurred after freight trains, only freight operations are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.242" offset="1572342">Freight trains had been brought in on a spur track from the main line to Hopewell, which was at the end of this -- of this side track.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.789" offset="1610480">There the cars were -- the trains were dismantled, taken apart in the classification yard and reassembled into smaller groups for delivery to the ultimate consignees.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.536" offset="1673488">And, our case deals with this movement of the delivery of 23-29 cars to the consignees are picking up these cars from the factories and bringing them back to the classification yard where they would again be combined into -- into larger trains.</text>

            <text syncTime="432.145" offset="1831999">These were uninterrupted movements without leaving off or picking up any cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.599" offset="1849762">They were movements in -- they had four operations involved, involving -- the first one was 26 cars, the second 28, and the third 29, and the fourth was 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.902" offset="1898977">And in each case, each of the three -- of three cases, they moved the entire three miles without stopping, well, they may've, I don't know what they -- without stopping but without leaving off or picking up any cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.811" offset="1954565">In the other case, there was a movement of only one mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.518" offset="1965432">They did pick up some cars of an interchange with the Norfolk and Western after they'd proceeded one mile, so that we have three movements of two miles and one movement of one mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.058" offset="2015587">These -- these operations were performed by trained -- by yard crews as the movements were ordered and directed by the yard manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.381" offset="2072848">The motor power was a diesel switching engine and the speed at which the train moved was -- was limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.465" offset="2117256">Their rules were that they must be able to stop within half the distance that they could see, half the line of vision.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.517" offset="2149439">The operations carried them across numerous streets and roads, at grade crossing and there were two or three intersections with Norfolk and Western spur tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.674" offset="2210043">The violation which was involved was that they didn't connect up the air hoses on these cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.587" offset="2237733">So far as I know, all of the cars were equipped with power brakes but the -- for operating reasons, the train -- the -- the crews determined to rely just on the train brake and not connect up the compressed air with the brakes on the individual cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.278" offset="2308472">This is not because it couldn't be done because the Seaboard had used air brakes on these very runs from the year 1951 until the year 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.112" offset="2355806">So far as I know, there were no violations during that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.064" offset="2367613">In this operation they did connect their -- their air brakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.211" offset="2384227">But in 1956, because of these operating reasons, it caused delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.528" offset="2413484">It took 20 minutes to connect up the brakes at the beginning, 20 minutes to disconnect them.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.989" offset="2431352">Took additional men.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.212" offset="2440234">For operating reasons, they decided they would stop, and they stopped in January of 1956 and made as in -- from then on it was their -- their policy not to connect these brakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.606" offset="2489762">So compared to its neighbor the ICC the inspectors observed these actual operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.687" offset="2518079">They filed the complaint and a civil suit followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.966" offset="2535215">The Court below, which is the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, found that the movements in question were not covered by the Safety Appliance Act on the ground that these strings of cars which I have described were not “trains” within the meaning of -- of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.361" offset="2620792">And that's the only question of interpretation we have really in this case is whether when they used the term “train” in the Act, they mean to refer to this type of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.792" offset="2670529">Now the Third Circuit reached the conclusion that they were not trains because it said that these were “switching operations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="650.344" offset="2704697">And again that's in quotes, “switching operations”.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.612" offset="2717863">Now the Act doesn't -- doesn't contain any specific exception for switching operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.039" offset="2747538">But in the early cases that came before this Court, the Court accepted an interpretation which the ICC and the Department of Justice suggested that there were certain limited movements by a locomotive, one or two cars involved in taking apart or putting together trains where they were continually dropping off and picking up trains which -- cars which were not trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.170" offset="2844087">They -- we suggested they were switching operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.460" offset="2857253">And in the early cases before this Court which dealt with transfer operations in which the Court held that the Safety Appliance Laws did apply, they recognized that that would be an exception for such -- for such a -- an operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.461" offset="2929246">It wasn't because it was switching, however.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.628" offset="2937919">There wasn't any -- there isn't any exception for switching.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.794" offset="2946591">It was because they felt in that type of operation, a train “was not involved.”</text>
            <text syncTime="719.602" offset="2981804">Now we think it's decisive in this case that there were mass movements of such relatively large numbers of cars over such a relatively large distance and without interruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.176" offset="3028093">This it seems to us, is not switching, is -- and is a -- it is a use of a -- of a train in the -- in the normally accepted use of the term “train.”</text>

            <text syncTime="748.334" offset="3096743">What do you regard as the determinative factor, the number of cars or the uninterrupted character of the haul or a combination of both?</text>

            <text syncTime="757.723" offset="3134255">Well certainly it can't be the number of cars by itself because there'd be many trains or there'd be one -- one car or two cars which would be trains and everyone would recognize as trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.859" offset="3178768">Many passenger trains will have only one or two cars so that certainly it wouldn't require a -- a long string of cars in order to be a train.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.538" offset="3233520">And the length of the -- the distance -- the distance of the move, too, is not and I don't believe it has to be as long as -- as two miles because well, one of the four cases which have been before this Court is the Louisville &amp; Jeffersonville Bridge Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.907" offset="3303006">In there was a distance -- was three-quarters of a mile and that was of -- of uninterrupted movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.723" offset="3326307">I think that you just have to look at the combination of what the railroad is actually doing to see whether it is dismantling trains, putting them together, spotting cars on them, or whether it's making a movement from one place to another, a transporting movement of the string of cars.</text>

            <text syncTime="908.535" offset="3737475">I mean if it was just a question of individual -- of the application to an individual movement if there'd been no -- what we conceive to be a misconstruction of the statute, a misapplication of the statute, unless that occurs so frequently that we have to be up here because the statute is whittled away so there's nothing left of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.654" offset="3813961">But obviously, each individual case can't be passed upon by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.548" offset="3841546">We think that unless Congress -- unless there's some compelling reason to believe that Congress used this term “train” in a technical sense to exclude some operations, that it must be taken in this ordinary common sense meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.202" offset="3912182">Now I must tell the Court that at the time the Act was passed, there was a technical definition of “train” which had been adopted by what was then called the American Railway Association, the predecessor of the American Association of Railroads today.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.845" offset="3982712">And they had a -- a rule -- standard operating rules for railroads and in this they did define a “train.”</text>
            <text syncTime="977.688" offset="4014164">And they defined it much as it's defined in the American Association of Railroad Rules today.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.338" offset="4040704">It's quoted on page 18 of my brother's brief as “a locomotive or more than locomotive couple, with or without cars and showing markers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.080" offset="4107682">This definition is just not helpful in connection with the use of air brakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.786" offset="4126490">It had its purpose but it -- whether or not a train shows markers has got no significance whatsoever --</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="1014.152" offset="4160031">Markers are the devices which are carried on the rear of the last car of a train.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.921" offset="4183019">In the day time, they are flags.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.318" offset="4188662">At night time, they're lights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.270" offset="4196498">And the reason that this definition occurs in these rules is that in the old days of single-track operation, on a train -- trains would separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.404" offset="4232965">The -- the linkage was and it stood between cars, and trains would sometimes separate in operation and the engineer wouldn't know it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.761" offset="4262431">Then if a train is -- passes another train on a -- on a switch and the switchman looks up and see as it go by and turns the waiting train into the track, he wants to be sure that all of the train has gone by.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.021" offset="4311437">Otherwise, there'll be a collision down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.522" offset="4321468">So he knows that the train has gone by when he sees the markers on the rear platform of the -- of last car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.221" offset="4348217">And this is -- this is a very realistic operating practice and something that's -- that s got nothing to do whether you ought to connect the air brakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.727" offset="4382281">In fact under that particular rule, a single -- a single locomotive without any cars at all or two locomotives coupled are -- are considered a “train.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.612" offset="4433795">And obviously the air brake regulation which has nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.055" offset="4447587">Actually, this rule was called to the attention of the court in the early cases, the Erie case and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy case which were the first two to come up under this provision of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.299" offset="4488547">And, these -- this provision and it's right with its definition of “train” was called to the court's attention and the court brushed it aside by saying that it had no relation to the -- to the -- what Congress had in mind in this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.444" offset="4549151">And so we suggest to the Court that, as the -- as the Court has said in one of the other cases, a string of cars, 26 cars, drawn by a locomotive is in common sense a train and this is what Congress had in mind in defining when the brakes should be coupled.</text>

            <text syncTime="1580.020" offset="6423489">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.336" offset="6448671">A Richmond newspaper, I'm referring to this case before the Court of Appeals, said that the question presented to the court was, what is a train?</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.875" offset="6490885">And I think that by -- tersely sums up the real question that is here presented to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.295" offset="6528502">And in that connection, may I say very briefly that -- and an answer to the question which was asked, that in the Burlington case the second of the cases which has been decided by this Court, the definition of what governs is precisely stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.260" offset="6648456">In the Burlington case, this Court said the controlling test of the statute's application lies in the essential nature of the work done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.029" offset="6695476">Now, that is exactly what was said and has been affirmed in the Northern Pacific case, the last of the cases which came before this Court the essential nature of the work done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.756" offset="6758379">Now if Your Honors please, it is striking that the Government has not stressed the nature of the work done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.922" offset="6807071">If I may state briefly the facts, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad extends from Richmond, Virginia to Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.124" offset="6847822">Just south of Richmond was this spur track leaving the main line at a point known as Bellwood, going to the industrial community of Hopewell which is at the confluence of the James and Appomattox Rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.298" offset="6908531">Now when a train leaves, and I may say that there is no passenger service on that line from Bellwood to Hopewell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.359" offset="6948760">When a train leaves the main line of the Seaboard and arrives in Hopewell, it goes to a classification yard which Your Honor will find in the upper right hand corner of the track which is attached to our brief in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.582" offset="7025664">That is a point where this freight train coming into Hopewell arrives and at that point, the train stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.315" offset="7068609">Every train stops and is broken up and the cars are distributed to the various tracks composing the yard for delivery to the multitude of industries which are along the track herein question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.386" offset="7164949">After those cars are divided up, then -- and they may be emptied or they may be lowered, it's depending on the requirements of the particular shipper involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.331" offset="7224717">Then with diesel locomotive power, they move out and may or may not drop off cars at least several, and there are nine in a distance of approximately two miles at the several spur tracks breaking out of the track to -- which is the -- where the operations here involved took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.366" offset="7324818">So, that there are nine different industrial tracks along that line.</text>

            <text syncTime="1948.025" offset="7895437">In this particular case, there were -- there are four movements involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.225" offset="7920306">In the case of one of the movements, the first one, there were movements from the Allied Chemical back to the yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.715" offset="7978193">That is of loaded cars going out, of 26 cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.448" offset="7997210">The speed of the train there is 10 miles per hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.724" offset="8014242">In the second movement, there was a -- a movement from the yard to the American Can Company in the opposite direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.798" offset="8046529">And in that particular instance, there were 13 cars ahead of its engine and 15 cars behind the engine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.624" offset="8081847">In the third instance, there were 29 cars that they started out with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.082" offset="8119672">They picked up 20 cars en route at the Norfolk and Western interchange which is about halfway between the so-called classification yard and the end of the Allied Chemical Plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.674" offset="8170036">Of those 20 cars that they'd picked up there, there were 6 loads and 14 empties and the speed was about six miles per hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.003" offset="8211414">And the fourth movement was from the yard and to two destinations, the Allied Chemical and the Can Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.203" offset="8248195">Eight cars moved ahead of the engine and 13 behind at a speed up from five to seven miles per hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.238" offset="8284348">Now there are the facts in this highly industrialized area within the yard limits of the City of Hopewell, within the railroad's yard limits where these movements which were made under control, not of any schedule or anything of that kind, but on the -- under the control of the agent at Hopewell, at yard speed which is defined by the company's rules as being the capacity or ability to stop within one-half of the visible distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.163" offset="8452054">So the speed here was always -- in no one of these four instances was in excess of 10 miles per hour, I believe and generally long.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.234" offset="8504299">The Government if Your Honors please, has stated its position in its brief at page 14 in the following language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.234" offset="8560306">“This Court laid down a clear-cut and precise construction of Congress' use of the term “train” as any movement of an assembled unit of engine and cars for an appreciable distance without coupling or uncoupling.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.545" offset="8641599">That's the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.909" offset="8651003">But that isn't what this Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.141" offset="8659884">This Court said that the controlling test and that's what it said in the Burlington case and again in the subsequent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.966" offset="8687261">The controlling test of the statute's application lies in the essential nature of the word “done.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.518" offset="8709413">Now what is that essential nature?</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.904" offset="8719026">It is furnishing shippers with the cars to meet their needs on a track within the yard limits with nine spurs broken -- breaking out from it, an engine sometimes in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.184" offset="8796139">Certainly that doesn't meet the common concept of a train operating at speeds from 6-10 miles an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.570" offset="8829680">Certain that isn't what is considered the -- the train movement purely for the purpose of picking up or setting off in these -- for these various industries their loads or their empty cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.110" offset="8895822">Now we recognize if Your Honor please, we recognize that transfer movements out or transfer trains, the statute is applicable to those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.424" offset="8961024">Those are cases where such as the first case that came before this Court, the Erie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.405" offset="8996968">In that particular instance the cars, trains, transfer trains were being moved between the Jersey City yards and the Weehawken yards, and the Bergen yards located approximately two miles that in each instance apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.458" offset="9069171">And as the court said, some looked to the points of the why.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.632" offset="9085889">But they were going from one yard to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.605" offset="9101772">Here the train has reached its destination of the classification yard in the City of Hopewell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.372" offset="9132910">And they are shifting these cars to the individual industries to pick up or unload, as the case may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.082" offset="9163734">And vice-versa, they collect those cars later and turn them to the classification yards where they are made up into trains and are carried to the main line at Bellwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.824" offset="9210650">So we say that the Erie case is not in any way applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.573" offset="9229667">Nor is it Burlington case itself because in that case they were dealing again with transfer of trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.405" offset="9261014">There the Kansas City yards were on both sides of the Missouri River and there was a single-track bridge with the main line, passenger, and freight used by three different railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.399" offset="9305004">And that -- it was over that they moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.348" offset="9316812">And so again in the Jeffersonville bridge case, the third case before this Honorable Court, it went in where they picked the cars up whether at C&amp;O and big four railroads and their yard, and they took it the entire length of this little bridge line, the Jeffersonville Railroad, and delivered the cars to the Illinois Central at the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.724" offset="9406255">Again that isn't the type of movement we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.118" offset="9423809">And in the Burlington case which was the last case before this Court, the contention there argued was that the movement had to be over a main line in order to be a train movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.680" offset="9474069">So now, if Your Honors please, we recognize that that isn't necessarily so and that that case settled that proposition that the movement does not have to be over main line, but it does have to be wherever it may be, a train movement because if it isn't a train movement, the statute isn't applicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2625.925" offset="10607052">This spur track into Hopewell from the main line of the Seaboard was constructed about 1931 or 1932.</text>

            <text syncTime="2657.165" offset="10732022">In 1951, according to the testimony of Mr. Kean, the assistant division superintendent, they were advised by a letter from the ICC that they felt that air brakes should be used in that operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.031" offset="10803493">In 1956 Mr. Merrick, a consultant employed by the Seaboard for this purpose who had been an inspector on exactly this type of thing with the Interstate Commerce Commission for 32 years, examined into the operation at Hopewell and reached the conclusion that the air brakes were not required under the terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.963" offset="10935254">And on the advice and under the guidance of Mr. Merrick with 32 years of experience as an Interstate Commerce Commission inspector on this type of work, the use of the airb rakes was discontinued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.346" offset="10996799">I may say that during the entire time whether they were used or not used, there has been no injury to an employee that may be in any way traceable nor to the public, that may be in any way traceable to the use or non-use of air brakes on this particular train or in these movements.</text>

            <text syncTime="2926.675" offset="11810043">And there they are about eight-feet apart where the Norfolk and Western not using air brakes and this complaint -- and doing exactly the same work as the Seaboard and this complaint was filed against the Seaboard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2969.411" offset="11980988">Now in conclusion, if Your Honors please, what has happened here is that they are attempting to take out of its context what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.691" offset="12042115">It was a switching movement and they have lifted out, just as you would a quotation from a book, a small segment of what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.354" offset="12100838">The prosecution is with respect to the movement between the classification yard and the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.102" offset="12139813">But actually the whole thing is a part of one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.058" offset="12151620">It is a shifting operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.073" offset="12159666">It's a switching operation after the train had arrived at Hopewell, and it is no longer a train it has been broken up and switched, and is being switched and delivered to the industries in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.585" offset="12213687">So there, if Your Honor please, in the lower court, Chief Judge Sobeloff dissented as to three movements but concurred in the opinion of the other two judges as to one other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.585" offset="12277739">And that was a movement in which the car -- train stopped and picked up 20 cars at the Norfolk and Western interchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.389" offset="12308877">He gives no reason, however, in his opinion why he distinguished the one from the other but that is the difference in facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.038" offset="12351509">So if it please the Court, in conclusion may I say that we fully concur in the statement with which the Court of Appeals concluded its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.911" offset="12411068">And there they said where Congress has commanded the use of train brakes, the courts cannot excuse a failure to use them because of the use of other devices and measures, however effective in assuring safety there may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.385" offset="12472926">But if the use of train brakes on these movements is costly, delay of shipments and creates new risks of injury without substantially contributing to the alleviation of existing way -- risks, it is a reminder that courts should not extend the requirement beyond the intention of Congress or needlessly chip away major portions of the long established exemption of switching operations.</text>
