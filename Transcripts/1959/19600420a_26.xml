            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 26, Sullivan, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Petitioner, versus Otto Behimer.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.829" offset="170715">Mr. Butler, you may proceed with you argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. John C. Butler</label>
            <text syncTime="22.182" offset="192136">Mr. Chief Justice and the Associate Justices, may it please this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.615" offset="225782">This certiorari review presents the question whether a district judge is authorized by virtue of Section 1404 (a) of the Judicial Code, to transfer on motion of the defendants, a diversity action pending before him to a forum where the convenience of the parties and witnesses in the interest of justice would best be served, but, wherein the venue of the transferee forum and the reach of its process was supplied by the assurances of the defendants to wave their venue privilege and to enter their personal appearances.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.596" offset="397772">However, the transferee forum was run which was competent to hear the issues in the suit, such forum independently possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter of the case by virtue of the diversity of citizenship of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.916" offset="483035">More generally, this case presents for determination the question whether Federal District Courts are authorized to transfer actions either on motion of plaintiff or of defendant to another forum which has become available since the commencement of the action by reason of such post-suit circumstances as, one, a change in the residence of the parties, or two, a plaintiff for a defendant corporation's qualification or doing of business in such other forum, or three, a defendant's consent to an acceptance of the venue in process of the transferee forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.406" offset="704972">In all such instances, I presuppose that such a transfer would be for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice were that not so the question of the authority of the district judge would be academic.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.909" offset="783026">The facts, out of which the present question arose in this case are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.602" offset="813746">Respondents, one, a citizen of Illinois and the other a citizen of New York filed suit in the Northern District of Illinois charging the two defendants, Standard Oil Company and Indiana Corporation and Standard Oil Foundation, Inc and Indiana Charitable Corporation with acquiring the assets of a Utah Corporation at less than the fair value of such assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.960" offset="943208">Plaintiffs, who are respondents here on respectively 900 and 1000 shares of stock in the Utah company, the two defendants owned approximately 76% of the outstanding stock of the Utah company.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.550" offset="1025546">And the defendants had organized to wholly on subsidiary which offered to buy all of the assets of such -- of such company.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.136" offset="1059924">This offer was considered at the special meeting of the shareholders of the company and was accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.800" offset="1090539">The charge against the defendants is that they, together with 52 so called controlled stockholders in the Utah Corporation, permitted the sale of these assets at a price less than fair value.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.574" offset="1173713">The plaintiffs sued not in the right of the Utah company but on behalf of themselves and all other stockholders who are or were similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.668" offset="1238079">Those stockholders are called minority stockholders in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.425" offset="1261066">Jurisdiction of the action was bottomed upon diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.621" offset="1289906">The residence of the defendants was not alleged nor did the complaint occur that the venue of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.973" offset="1347271">Defendants however, did not raise this question and so they have waived it.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.525" offset="1377468">The day following the answers of the defendants in which they denied the crucial substantive allegations of the complaint, they filed a motion to transfer the action to the District of Utah, Central Division which is at Salt Lake City.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.234" offset="1448312">Petitioner granted the motion to transfer saying that, and I quote “If I have the power to do so, I would be guilty of an abuse of the discretion vested in me by Section 1404 (a) of the Judicial Code if I refuse to transfer this action to Salt Lake City.”</text>
            <text syncTime="359.304" offset="1540577">In some, there were eight reasons which moved the petitioner to this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.847" offset="1566804">These are set forth at pages 88 and 89 of the record and they're summarized at page 5 of the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.283" offset="1612466">An important reason among those eight is found in the fact that the class on whose behalf of the two respondents have volunteered to act, consists of 920 shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.396" offset="1676936">575 of them reside in Utah and 134 more in California, Washington and Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.881" offset="1726882">However, petitioner's order of transfer was stayed by the issuance of the writ of mandamus by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.148" offset="1767946">That Court stated that petitioner did not have the power to transfer, since the transfer reform must be a district were a plaintiff has a right to sue independently of the wishes of defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.805" offset="1830640">If the plaintiff does not have this right, independently of the wishes of the defendant, it is not a district where it might have been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.263" offset="1872436">Now, since venue and personal jurisdiction in this instance where available to the plaintiffs in Utah, only by reason of the post of assurances of the defendants, under the standards adopted by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.785" offset="1938474">Such assurances were unavailing and transfer was unauthorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.766" offset="1966477">So holding, the Court of Appeals did not reach the question which respondents had also raised before them as to the exercise of the petitioner's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.256" offset="2016423">The Court of Appeals said whether or not he and his Judge Sullivan properly exercised his discretion in the mistaken and the belief that he did have such power, it will be unnecessary for us to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.586" offset="2089671">It is petitioner's contention not the phrase “where it might have been brought,” as such appears in Section 1404 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="506.987" offset="2131362">And incidentally, in my view, a most deceptively simple phrase is at least an ambiguus phrase and that it does not establish the time of determination as to the where.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.131" offset="2203878">As Mr. Merriam has pointed out yesterday, the courts which have dealt with this matter have spoken of such time in terms of commenced or could now be brought or maybe prosecuted and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.166" offset="2280051">That you will find rehearsed in the Paramount Pictures versus Rodney case and in the opinion of Chief Judge Magruder in the Josephson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.647" offset="2325922">It is petitioner's contention that this phrase been at the least ambiguous because of its silence about the matter of when one is to determine where an action might have been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.743" offset="2382346">Should be interpreted so as to confer upon the District Courts the power to transfer if at the time the power is exercised, the transferee forum is, one, where the action might have been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.452" offset="2449220">Such an interpretation will in the petitioner's view and here I quote from Chief Judge Magruder, “Enhance the usefulness of this important provision for transfer of cases in the interest of convenience and justice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="605.404" offset="2524975">The transfer provision so construed will then be available to both plaintiff and defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.812" offset="2566666">An instance was mentioned yesterday by Mr. Merriam, which I should like briefly to repeat here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.631" offset="2593938">“Let us suppose a case of a plaintiff being a New York resident, being involved in an accident in New Jersey, occasioned by the negligence of a defendant, who is a California citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.259" offset="2656423">And the defendant being merely momentarily in the State is not available for the process and then it would be improper because it would be either New York or California.”</text>
            <text syncTime="651.878" offset="2710862">After suit is filed and this is a hypothetical case, but after suit is filed, let us assume that the defendant moves to New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.602" offset="2753808">Plaintiff in order to have sued the defendant had to proceed to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.317" offset="2776691">May he not move to transfer his case to New Jersey where on my supposition, the cause of action arose, the witnesses reside and where all of the convenience of the witnesses in the interest of justice will best be served by having the Court there hear the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.450" offset="2861223">If the contention -- if the position of the Court of Appeals in my circuit is correct, that would be denied to the plaintiff in my hypothetical case.</text>

            <text syncTime="702.657" offset="2913991">The plaintiff in my hypothetical case, Mr. Justice Whittaker, could sue in New Jersey and drop a suit in California, but he couldn't transfer it because at the time he filed his suit in California which was the only place he could then reach the defendant, this -- the forum of New Jersey was unavailable to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="744.992" offset="3083368">Except in the Court of Appeals' interpretation, that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.120" offset="3099878">If you then say by brought, you mean not only commenced but service of process acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.390" offset="3144913">There are some cases, District Court cases earlier which have gone off on the thought that commenced is equivalent to brought and have transferred on that basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1587.565" offset="6453582">And that is this, that Section 1404 (a) is the remedial statute, it was -- it adopted the doctrine of forum non conveniens.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.561" offset="6637589">And I should like to call particularly to the Court's attention, the case of Vargas versus A. H. Bull Steamship Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.263" offset="6668413">A very well reasoned decision by a court in New Jersey, the Law Division of the Superior Court, who's opinion was adopted by the Supreme Court of New Jersey involving a Jones Act case, a federally created right of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.971" offset="6827238">It could not have been filed in the Northern District of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.655" offset="6845942">Although no charges made in the complaint, counsel for the respondents in an affidavit have suggested that the principal office, the place of business of Standard Oil Company is in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.014" offset="6891395">And under the amendment of Section 1332 which was enacted July 25th, 1958, that then would make Standard a resident of Illinois for purposes of diversity and there would be an Illinois plaintiff and Illinois defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.644" offset="6953984">Diversity would be destroyed and presumably, the plaintiff would then have recourse only to the state courts of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.411" offset="6981047">In which event, Illinois having the doctrine of forum non conveniens, it is reasonable to suppose that they would do as, it was done in the Rogers case in New Jersey conditionally dismissed the case on the insurances there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.663" offset="7034023">They have been given to the District Court in this case, namely that they would accept the venue in the process of the alternate forum which is the much more convenient forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.240" offset="7072371">It would be in other words, I should think, rather strange to construe Section 1404 (a) in a fashion which would be somewhat retrogressive denying it the authority, the power, or the scope which as antecedent doctrine possesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.127" offset="7147917">Particularly, in view of the fact that section 1404 (a) has been well regarded as a remedial statute and its provision should be given hospitable scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.465" offset="7193266">I might add that to give the construction that the petitioner contends for here, does not make mere surplusage of the phrase “where it might have been brought” because we have three factors to consider, venue, personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.117" offset="7263796">Venue is a mere privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="2029.362" offset="8220818">The question was just asked as to the intention of the Congress in enacting Section 1404 (a) and an examination of the status of litigation in the period when Section -- Section 1404 (a) was enacted, might shed a little bit of light on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.661" offset="8314023">In 1947 and 1946, the House Judiciary Subcommittee was holding hearings on -- with reference to the bringing of suits against railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.400" offset="8396988">Some of the facts that were brought up before the Subcommittee were these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.302" offset="8416632">For example, in Minnesota at one time, there were over 1000 personal injury cases brought in the state courts of Minnesota by nonresidents -- nonresident plaintiff against railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.206" offset="8472221">And some of the railroads didn't even have lines in Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.847" offset="8490715">One lawyer in Chicago filed 100 suits within a period of one year against the Southern Pacific Railroad and the Santa Fe with Diamond in excess of $6 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.232" offset="8536273">And an analysis of the distance from Chicago to the site of the accident on the average was some 1930 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.137" offset="8575875">The average accident occurred 1930 miles from Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.399" offset="8604923">Between 1941 and 1946, there were 2500 suits filed in the District Court other than the district in which the accident occurred or in which the plaintiff resided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.049" offset="8647555">What was occurring in those -- in that period of time was, in personal injury cases, primarily in suits under the Federal Employers Liability Act, lawyers would get these cases and file them as far from site of the accident is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.968" offset="8703248">An action happened in New Mexico, they filed in Minnesota or in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.477" offset="8733236">The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not a universally accepted doctrine in 1946 and 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.604" offset="8769808">In an article in the California Law Review by Edward Barrett, Professor of Law at the University of California, he states that the doctrine had not been examined and just passed upon by most of the states, that 14 states had rejected it and only six states had accepted the doctrine of forum non conveniens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.269" offset="8852459">One of those states was New York, in which it was a statutory right given to the court to transfer if the court felt it was a tort action brought for purpose of harassment of the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2229.897" offset="9022986">The doctrine originally arose in Scotland, I understand, in the suits between nonresidents and it was first adopted in this country where there were nonresident litigants and the cause of action had arose outside of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.216" offset="9080247">And in that case -- those cases, they were sent back to their respective countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.264" offset="9104384">But the decisions in the Gulf Oil Company case and the Lumberman's case indicated, after a split decision of five to four that they should be -- the doctrine should be applied only in exceptional circumstances or the use of the word “those rare cases” where the doctrine should be applied and it was not generally recognized that the federal courts would have the right to transfer these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.502" offset="9209396">If there were an accident case that happened in New Mexico, filed in Minnesota, then Santa Fe would have the right to remove the case to the federal court in Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.093" offset="9255790">But it still could not transfer that case to the -- to the state where the accident occurred, where the witnesses were located.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.131" offset="9295914">And some writers have indicated that the purpose of the enactment of Section 1404 was to exact the remedy of this situation where in personal injury cases, the suits were brought far from the State where the accident occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.350" offset="9368743">And the venue statutes of the various states and under the Employer's Liability Act permits, the suits to be brought where the defendant resides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.938" offset="9415137">And because of that are -- that there will always be more than one forum in these railroad cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.650" offset="9441991">These railroad lines go through a dozen or more states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.127" offset="9455888">And if the suit is brought in Minnesota in an accident happened in Montana, then proper venue would have been in Montana, coexist and with the venue in Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.480" offset="9513253">And Section 1404 gave the federal court in Minnesota the power to transfer it to a -- the forum where it could have been originally brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.182" offset="9556093">And I believe the purpose of 1404 was to actually broaden, thus, the doctrine as it had been enunciated in the two cases decided by this Court where they used the word, “the exceptional case, exceptional circumstances, the rare instance”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.711" offset="9626206">It was and it's so that the Court has a bigger leeway in transferring cases to a forum where the suit could have been bought in -- in the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.515" offset="9673435">It is their position of course that -- of the respondents here that there is no ambiguity in the words “where it might have been brought”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.547" offset="9713560">Section 1391, the general venue section, Section 1400, serving venue of patents, all used the word “may bring”.</text>

            <text syncTime="2775.668" offset="11206092">Mr. King, you pointed out that a railroad, typically does business in many, many states and that the basic purpose perhaps was to enable a transfer of -- of a lawsuit against the railroad to a district closer or to the district, where the personal injury has occurred and where the witness is presumably are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.592" offset="11301700">But there are great many other diversity of citizenship cases, and many of them are negligence cases involving automobile accidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.450" offset="11341197">And as I -- I'm right, am I not, in thinking that under the diversity venue statute, the plaintiff is limited to his residence or that of the defendant under general diversity under the enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.858" offset="11398771">Now, it said certainly, not a rare or very hypothetical case to have an automobile accident happen fairly far from the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.791" offset="11446523">And Massachusetts can be involved in a collision with a man from New York, both -- and they're both on their summer vacation in Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.436" offset="11493125">And yet, under your interpretation of this -- this statute, the Court would be powerless, would it not to -- to transfer an -- an action even though both -- both of the parties were willing to the district where the actual -- called the locus of the actual cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2878.573" offset="11617677">But I doubt if a Court would have the power to transfer a -- this particular action to Montana or Wyoming.</text>
