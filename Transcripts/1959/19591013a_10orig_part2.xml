            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="14.657" offset="162043">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.846" offset="166745">I think the correct answer is that there was no dispute in that one side asserted the three leagues and the other side asserted that there couldn't be a three-league.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.613" offset="209795">There was this factor that there was the convention in regard to the boundary that was set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.836" offset="234768">And for that, they adopted the -- referred to the provisions of the prior agreement with Spain, Mexico and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.616" offset="277817">And then they agreed that the convention of boundary would be as agreed by the convention in establishing a portion of it along the northern side and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.056" offset="335600">And in doing that, the agreement was beginning -- the boundary beginning at a mound at the mouth of the Sabine River.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.965" offset="387218">So that there wasn't even at -- as the Government construed, there wasn't even an assertion at that time that there was any right to three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.891" offset="426924">It was a recognition that the boundary itself would begin at the shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.471" offset="449285">Now, it wasn't a dispute that was raised in such a way that you've just -- that's just the conclusion you've engulfed in the circumstances, seems to us.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="152.252" offset="712391">Well, in general terms, I think it was, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.608" offset="729840">The United States contends that Texas never exercised dominion or control over this maritime boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.990" offset="771323">It claims that its gunboats did become active throughout the entire Gulf area.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.877" offset="810924">We contend that that is not sufficient under international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.375" offset="828897">It does not establish any claim under that kind of a construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.631" offset="845928">United States would have had possession of the entire Atlantic and Pacific Oceans during the World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.418" offset="873096">But there would have to be an assertion of the right to keep people out of this particular three-league area to satisfy international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.709" offset="906219">And there's no evidence produced of that kind at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.387" offset="920952">There is a claim that are two small ships of the United States that were taken and that that was a ground for claiming that they had -- they occupied and had jurisdiction of this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.061" offset="987617">One of them was taken in Matagorda Bay and they paid an indemnity for -- in connection with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.610" offset="1013844">And it was clearly within the three-mile area so it wouldn't be any proof whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.840" offset="1034742">I think that was the Durango.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.722" offset="1042265">The other one was (Inaudible) and there's no showing as to where it was taken at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.909" offset="1063058">So there's no other evidence of any kind that they, in fact, occupied this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.257" offset="1092420">The statute however, I'd like to call your attention to, we believe that the United States was bound to what was properly included within under the law and rightfully belonged to.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.738" offset="1150307">Now, if those terms are not clear enough by themselves as to what -- so that you'd looked to any interpretation, it seems to me, you'd look the interpretation in the debates in which it was recognized that the claims were -- of Texas were very extreme that they could not be maintained and that all of these boundaries had to be reexamined and Texas had to be taken in, in accordance with what she really had in accordance with proper international law.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.471" offset="1321253">There was a -- action by the United States of paying $10,000,000 to Texas in connection with claims in regard to some of these territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.265" offset="1380394">The sponsor of that bill said that those were purported claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.655" offset="1409964">He did not urge that they were valid claims and there was much presented during the debates about the fact that Texas was badly in debt and needed this $10,000,000 to meet her bond issues and physical problems that she had and this was a question then of our having acquired all of the Mexican area ourselves and the United States fixing the boundary between the two countries in trying to set up the New Mexican State.</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.948" offset="13839130">Because, our statute that is, the Act of Congress which enabled Louisiana to become a State, set a perimeter construction, it said that all of the territory of Louisiana, all of the country of Louisiana which the United States had acquired, contained within these following limits, should become the State of Louisiana, if the people adopted the Constitution and if the Federal Congress approved that Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.652" offset="13990013">And this description was not one which said that Louisiana would have a mainland and a number of islands or a part of a river and a number of islands.</text>

            <text syncTime="3510.648" offset="14145912">But then we should go to the thirty-third degree latitude, come down the Mississippi River and to Iberville river to the Gulf, back to the point of beginning including all islands within three leagues of coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.663" offset="14210069">Again the matter of islands was incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.197" offset="14224175">The essential thing and this Court has held -- the essential thing is that Louisiana wants to have a water boundary in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.109" offset="14279764">And the only place, the only measure for that water boundary as set by our Act of Admission is at three leagues from coast the same measure -- the same measure which the Congress in 1953 set as the limit to which any of the States on the Gulf coast could claim these property rights of the submerged lands and the natural resources.</text>

            <text syncTime="4249.210" offset="17100257">And we say that everything in the history of our State to this moment supports this perimeter description.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.156" offset="17144038">Now, I'd like to show to the Court how the Government, the Federal Government itself, at the time the other states came into the Union, regarded the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.348" offset="17196805">And I think it will demonstrate -- I hope it will demonstrate conclusively that the argument that Texas has made for its three-league boundary into the Gulf of Mexico, is absolutely solid and that it depends and is based upon the verity of the arguments, we now make in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.827" offset="17302653">Because you see, starting from Louisiana in the surge eastward and westward and it occurred at the same time, it became necessary for our Government to acquire territories to sustain and to fix the boundary, we explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.123" offset="17391888">These were done by the Treaty of 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.091" offset="17407770">Now, how that became necessary I think is interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.562" offset="17429608">But, I'm sure the Court knows this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4333.679" offset="17438072">You know that the people from Kentucky and Tennessee came down into our area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.877" offset="17466911">You know that from 1763 until 1783, the English claimed that part of our coast which is now Mississippi and Alabama and Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.557" offset="17525635">Spain had denuded to England at the end of the French and Indian War, at the same time that France ceded Louisiana to Spain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.637" offset="17565968">When England got it, England claimed six leagues into the sea through the proclamation of George III of October 7, 186 -- 1763.</text>

            <text syncTime="4383.326" offset="17636707">This is where Mississippi, Alabama and Florida are now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.199" offset="17660217">King George III divided Florida into West Florida and East Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.720" offset="17694281">As Spain had held it, there had been no such division.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.386" offset="17708910">King George III made that division claiming all islands within six leagues of coast for the whole of this area and in language which I think and the lawyers of Mississippi and Alabama think, also described a perimeter in the sea, in the Gulf of Mexico, for those areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.227" offset="17812250">Now, after this occurred, came of course, the War of Independence and during the War of Independence, the Spanish under Governor Galvez in New Orleans, came into my area of Louisiana around Baton Rouge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.627" offset="17873899">Had a battle with the English and drove them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.474" offset="17893230">In 1783, when our Treaty of Peace was signed, England as a part of the same transaction retroceded the Florida's -- to Spain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.123" offset="17955819">So that when Louisiana was purchased and when Louisiana became a State, to the east of us, lays Spanish territory, to the west of us, lays Spanish Territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4475.879" offset="18006915">When the Louisiana Purchase was made, our commissioners were directed by Mr. Jefferson to claim all islands within six leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4488.993" offset="18059368">And in doing so, he was giving recognition to what George III of England had proclaimed and he said so, and he told the commissioners that they should surely of such -- such claims, because England had not objected to -- to such a measure, but had proclaimed it and that Spain and France had been agreeable to it, when England proclaimed it and by all means to make like claims to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4522.247" offset="18192384">And so you see that at that time, Mr. Jefferson, who was President, was certainly not limiting their claims of the United States in the Gulf of Mexico to any three miles, but was claiming all that any of the powers which it held this area had claimed before.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.953" offset="18267199">However, the commissioners, while they were intent on getting the seat, because that was of importance to the commerce of the United States at the time, neglected to specifically say that they were getting that part of Louisiana which is bounded by the Mississippi River to the west and the Pearl river to the east and the Iberville river, or by a man shack to the south and the Mississippi Territory to the north.</text>
            <text syncTime="4570.081" offset="18383705">So, our people who lived there under the leadership of a man named (Inaudible) who was the judge then, but had been Consul-General of the United States to France, had a revolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.996" offset="18455385">And they established the West Florida Republic in 1810.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.740" offset="18478373">And they raised there, the first lone star flag, a white star on a field of blue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4600.850" offset="18506794">They called on the United States Government to annex the territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4606.661" offset="18529991">The United States did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.611" offset="18541798">And the Congress acted directing troops into the territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.792" offset="18562591">The Congress acted also in annexing to the Mississippi territory that part of West Florida which forms the coast of Mississippi and annexing to Alabama that part of West Florida which forms the coast of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.088" offset="18639705">This Court recognized all that I'm talking about in Foster against Neilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="4640.489" offset="18665305">These same people who were compelling the forward expansion of the American Government, of the American country of the United States, then moved westward and we had to deal with Spain and so we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.660" offset="18750046">In 1819, Spain ceded West Florida and East Florida to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4673.249" offset="18796335">In the very same Act, Spain and the United States agreed upon a boundary between the two at the mouth of the Sabine River in the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.653" offset="18845968">Now, they did not say how far that point was in the sea, but the only measure that they had to go by was the three leagues, the three-league measurement which had been set by Congress with respect to Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="4705.139" offset="18923917">In 1828, when the Mexicans had their independence, this Treaty of 1819 was confirmed in 1836, when the Texans had their independence and they enacted their Boundary Act of 1836, without which they've been a lot said already.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.254" offset="19028407">They put it at the mouth of the Sabine and they called it three leagues into the sea and they said that it was the boundary that had been determined by the United States and Spain in 1819.</text>
            <text syncTime="4751.881" offset="19110849">They were not taking just any point, anywhere out of the sky or out of the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.189" offset="19148152">They went to the existing declarations of policy, the existing laws of our country at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4770.640" offset="19185977">They recognized that the southwest corner of the United States and the southwest corner of Louisiana had been fixed at the mouth of the Sabine in the sea that it could only be three leagues from the mouth of the Sabine in the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.753" offset="19258389">They put their own corner there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.771" offset="19274480">And their boundary descriptions specifically says that on their eastern line, they are following the boundary fixed between Spain and the United States to the point of beginning and the point of beginning is three leagues in the Gulf of Mexico from land at the mouth of the Sabine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.591" offset="19373746">Now, in the same -- in the same Boundary Act, they direct their Governor Barnett to negotiate with the United States to establish it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.004" offset="19423378">And he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.277" offset="19428498">And the April 25th, 1938 Convention accepts that boundary and appoints commissioners to mark off a part of the boundary, not the entirety of it, but appoints commissioners to mark off a part of that boundary as established by the Act of 1836 tying it exactly and only to the boundary of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="4862.250" offset="19552423">This was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4863.502" offset="19557334">The commissioners went down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.857" offset="19566843">They put a mound on the west bank of the Sabine at the mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.859" offset="19590771">And the Government makes a point of -- of the location of this surveyor's mound.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.397" offset="19616998">But I ask you, how would these surveyors have put a mound three leagues from land in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico?</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.836" offset="19662764">They put the mound where obviously they had to put.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.698" offset="19686170">And all of you as lawyers have had experience with surveyors and you know that since no surveyor can walk on the water, all surveyors from land have to have land markings, bench marks, which take you to the actual legal boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4918.641" offset="19777912">Why -- why on earth would the boundary of Texas have been fixed anywhere else than where I'm saying?</text>
            <text syncTime="4925.760" offset="19806438">How could it have been fixed anywhere else?</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.000" offset="19819395">A boundary has to be aligned between neighbors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4933.673" offset="19838098">The Texans were Americans before they were Texans.</text>
            <text syncTime="4937.187" offset="19852100">They came out of Louisiana, from Kentucky, from Tennessee, but through my area with their own star flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.715" offset="19894209">They traded with Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.925" offset="19903091">The chief road into Texas at that time was a road which is now known as U.S. Highway 190, throughout Opelousas, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.201" offset="19944155">It was there because that is the nearest land to the Gulf above the deltaic formations of the Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.133" offset="19999953">And that's where the men had to travel and that's where they did travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4979.366" offset="20020851">The commerce between Texas and the United States was chiefly between New Orleans and between Galveston named for our Governor Galvez.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.198" offset="20064214">And that was where the important part of the Gulf coast territory of the United States and of Louisiana existed at the time that was the populous part.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.919" offset="20127013">That was the part that had economic value.</text>
            <text syncTime="5008.702" offset="20138193">That was the part that had military value.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.717" offset="20150209">That was the part that our country was insistent upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="5018.894" offset="20178944">So of course, the boundary of Texas was tied to the boundary of Louisiana, three leagues from land in the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="5027.500" offset="20213321">This Court recognized that boundary when Justice Harlan and earlier Justice Harlan was arguing at the Court in 1896 in United States versus Texas, 162 U.S. 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="5044.223" offset="20280299">And while there has been called of the right of the United States to adjust the boundaries of Texas, no move whatever has been made to adjust the boundaries of Texas or of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico, three leagues from land.</text>

            <text syncTime="5102.234" offset="20512266">You go through the mouth of the Sabine and you proceed along the course of the Sabine three-league distance into the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.685" offset="20546121">And then you proceed at the same measurements from the coast wherever the baseline of the coast is determined to be towards -- towards the eastern line of (Inaudible) and you draw a perimeter description three leagues from land and into the sea, so that all islands will thereby be embraced, though I say again that the matter of the island was an incidental matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.420" offset="20689063">The measure of the three leagues is the important measurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5151.272" offset="20708498">This was necessary on the Gulf coast not only of Louisiana, but of Texas and Mississippi and Alabama and Florida, because we have shallow waters there, because the Continental Shelf drops so slowly, because sometimes for a mile, boats cannot approach the shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.363" offset="20808808">In 1817, Commander Porter reporting from the Secretary of Navy, that he couldn't get within 10.5 miles of the mouth of the Sabine.</text>

            <text syncTime="5218.216" offset="20976201">And necessarily, our Government in the early days of the 19th Century, taking into consideration the nature of the neighborhood which all governments, Mr. Jefferson said, should do in fixing their boundaries, placed one far enough out to get us to the deep waters that we were entitled to command.</text>

            <text syncTime="5396.595" offset="21689762">I think it is an expressed inclusion of three leagues into the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="5406.185" offset="21728110">I think that it is far more than saying the mainland, plus certain islands which are not even named.</text>
            <text syncTime="5416.086" offset="21767711">I think it necessarily means three leagues into the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="5422.353" offset="21792789">And then I add, but if there is any doubt in the language, if there is any doubt at all in the language, then the contemporaneous construction of it, given by our Congress over a period of years extending from 1811 when the Enabling Act was passed, until 1848 when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was enacted, establishes beyond any reasonable doubt that at all times, the Congress of the United States meant to accord to Louisiana, meant to include in Louisiana, three leagues from its coast into the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="5470.565" offset="21985677">And that it was not until in the 1850s long after Louisiana was a member of the Union, long after Mississippi was a member of the Union, long after Alabama and Florida and Texas were members of the Union, that the United States began to develop any foreign policy limiting the area in the sea to three miles that the first expression of it becomes anywhere near to Louisiana, was in 1862.</text>
            <text syncTime="5505.748" offset="22126320">And that was near to Louisiana, because that was all for Cuba, after you get past the waters of the Gulf of Mexico to the point where they are merging with the Atlantic Ocean and with the Caribbean Sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="5521.373" offset="22188910">But so far as the Gulf of Mexico is concerned, neither Mr. Jefferson, nor anyone else for our Government until long after these States were in the Union, ever spoke at all of any three-mile territorial limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5541.879" offset="22270934">Mr. Jefferson himself, when he put the minimum of a three-mile limit, was dealing with the Atlantic Ocean and the first time he had to deal with the Gulf of Mexico, he called on our commissioners to claim six leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="5561.314" offset="22348675">Your Honors, dealt with this I think so much better than I am trying to deal with it, when you decided Louisiana against Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="5572.464" offset="22393187">When you got to that case, we were concerned with oyster fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5578.272" offset="22416488">We were concerned with submerged lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="5582.664" offset="22434043">And as Your Honor commented yesterday the idea of the sedentary fishing existed long before the Truman Proclamation and it was involved in this litigation of Louisiana against Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.313" offset="22496632">We had laws requiring the fishing and handling of oysters to be done in a certain way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.796" offset="22522546">Mississippi had different laws, a conflict arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5610.307" offset="22544593">And it came to this Court and this Court said the islands, marsh or otherwise, claimed by Louisiana in this case were all within three leagues of our coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="5624.400" offset="22601017">The act admitting Mississippi was passed five years after Louisiana Act, yet Mississippi claims under the disputed territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.915" offset="22639052">Then talking about the rule that no State can be deprived of its prior territory, the Court proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="5642.733" offset="22674265">And when the Louisiana Act used the words, “Thence bounded by the said Gulf to the place of beginning including all islands in three leagues of the coast,” the coast referred to as the whole coast of the State and the peninsula of St. Bernard formed an integral part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.645" offset="22757961">Lake Borgne in Mississippi Sound, the bodies of saltwater and as such parts of the sea or gulf and as the coast of Louisiana began along the north shore of peninsula, it is not to be supposed that the islands referred to by Congress in the Louisiana Act were solely those islands to the south of that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5688.959" offset="22859212">I'd like to pause here to note -- to ask Your Honors to note the erroneous way in which I think the Government has treated this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5700.388" offset="22904874">The Government has undertaken to treat it, if I understand it correctly that all with the Louisiana and Mississippi decision was concerned with was the St. Bernard peninsula.</text>
            <text syncTime="5714.993" offset="22963388">But the Court fixed the boundary for the St. Bernard peninsula on the basis of our coast into the Gulf of Mexico that is, deep water, where the inland waters meet the deep waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5733.229" offset="23036322">And because it is so important, may I read to you just another part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5762.408" offset="23153037">The Court said, “The United States Geological Survey published in the year 1900, a bulletin devoted to a discussion of the boundaries of the States territories and giving a history of changes as they have occurred.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5780.898" offset="23227016">In the opinion of that bureau, Louisiana was originally bounded by the deep water channel and is the owner of the areas in dispute today according to the report and accompanying sketches and this Court made those sketches a part of its decision and so a water boundary into the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="5807.889" offset="23334954">Now, you'll find that sketch, Your Honors, on page 21 of Louisiana's separate brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.671" offset="23386049">I'd like now to say this, when the Submerged Lands Act was before the Congress, Louisiana's position was made clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5835.230" offset="23444250">No one was left in doubt that Louisiana was discerning a claim to three leagues from coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="5842.681" offset="23474134">Our Governor Kennon came up and appeared before the Committee hearings and made it specifically, categorically and as I'm trying to make it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5855.355" offset="23524812">Moreover, when the report was formulated, the -- the same exhibit to which Governor Daniel referred said categorically that the areas which would go to the State coincide with the three-mile limit for all States except Texas, Louisiana and Florida Gulf coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="5893.186" offset="23676113">In the latter cases, the three-league limit as established before or at the time of entering into the Union has been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="5904.356" offset="23720835">And it was this Committee Report which represented the better opinion, at least the one accepted by Congress, because it was this majority report which led to the adoption of the Submerged Lands Act by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="5948.404" offset="23897004">That we have to ask this Court to find as a matter of fact and law, that our boundaries as they existed at the time we came into the Union, that is, as established by our Enabling Act and our Constitution and our Act of Admission and as recognized by Congress thereafter, are where I say they there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5973.105" offset="23995747">I do not mean that the Submerged Lands Act was self-operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.539" offset="24021556">But I do mean that it is no -- could be no surprise to any Congressman or anyone in the United States that the Louisiana -- State of Louisiana asserted a claim to three leagues into the Gulf of Mexico from coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="5999.398" offset="24100968">And I'd like to add this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6002.188" offset="24112149">That in the Government's brief, the Government undertook to say that Senator Holland of Florida, while he did present this map to the Committee later said, that the map was not correct as to Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="6021.894" offset="24190934">So Mr. Scott will consume, my colleague in this case, undertook to make the calculations necessary to demonstrate and he does demonstrate conclusively in the reply brief which we filed in September of this year, as Your Honors will see on page 13 that the area claimed for Louisiana as shown in this exhibit, depends upon the three-league measurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6061.255" offset="24348400">That it is 397 shorelines in miles, multiplied by 10.5 land miles to make, that's the three leagues, to make the 4168.5 square miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="6077.073" offset="24411617">The report says 4169 square miles and I guess we won't be held with the other half-mile.</text>

            <text syncTime="6168.324" offset="24776704">I think it proves this, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6172.834" offset="24794676">That we do, in fact, have a three-league line because the report to Congress was based upon the coast and geodetic survey made by the Federal Government in November of 1950, long before there was any conflict between the States and the National Government over the oil, because the oil was not then known.</text>
            <text syncTime="6201.946" offset="24911182">And I say to you -- I say through the Court that there is thus a long sequence of recognitions by the Federal Government starting in 1811, coming down to 1915 at least, during which the Congress, this Court, agencies of the Government recognized a water boundary for Louisiana and whenever a measurement was applied, that measurement was three leagues from coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="6240.366" offset="25064887">I think that to say now, Louisiana has something less than that is to turn all of history backward.</text>
            <text syncTime="6250.737" offset="25106369">It's to disregard all of the history of the Gulf coast area and is to say that we are limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="6259.564" offset="25141582">We are limited to three miles only because after 1860 -- after 1860, the Federal Government began to talk of three miles in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="6276.477" offset="25209292">That's not the test made by the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6280.816" offset="25226637">The Submerged Lands Act submits the test of boundaries as they existed at the time or if we use Section 4 or prior to the time that the State became a member of the Union, or as approved by the Congress after that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6302.986" offset="25315349">We say that when we were admitted into the Union, Congress declared for us a boundary of three leagues in the Gulf of Mexico, that Congress applied that three-league measurement in the Gulf of Mexico as to Spain, Mexico and Texas, and finally, again at the western end of Texas with Mexico and that we have met the test which the Congress submitted by the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6344.117" offset="25479816">When I spoke to the Court in April 1957, I took occasion to say to the Court and I'd like to say again, that the same Congress which passed the Submerged Lands Act passed the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6365.018" offset="25563408">That the Congress did not say in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act that this area began three miles from shore or three miles from coast, but that it began to where the submerged lands yielded to the States, relinquished to the States, or vested in the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6389.403" offset="25661001">And I think that the Submerged Lands Act shows clearly that the Congress knew of the decisions of Your Honors, in the California case, of the decision in the Louisiana case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6410.354" offset="25744802">They knew that Your Honors had said that at the turn of the century, there had been no general agreement and I talked about at the beginning of the 19th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="6422.202" offset="25792136">There had no general agreement upon any three-mile limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6426.584" offset="25809690">As a matter of fact at that time the French writers and the Spanish writers from whose domains Louisiana came, were consistently claiming a three-league boundary as appears in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6441.467" offset="25869249">I think that the Submerged Lands Act and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act together, show that Congress was fully aware of the meaning in which boundary was to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="6459.193" offset="25940093">As a matter of fact, in this Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the Congress said, “The Constitution and laws and civil and political jurisdiction of the United States are hereby extended to the subsoil and seabed of the Outer Continental Shelf and to the extent they are applicable, they also permitted the extension of state laws with the expressed declaration that this would not have the effect of extending the property rights conveyed by the Submerged Lands Act to the States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6502.353" offset="26112815">But we think it is clear that Louisiana is entitled under the Submerged Lands Act to three leagues into the Gulf of Mexico from coast.</text>
