            <label>Mr. Francis Hoague</label>
            <text syncTime="35.552" offset="245530">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.098" offset="259741">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington, which judgment sustained or held constitutional, the provisions of a certain statute which I will describe to you shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.196" offset="340198">The appellants are two full professors at the University of Washington, which is a State University having tenure on -- being the professors, have tenure and with certain retirement rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.122" offset="399862">The appellees are the State Attorney General, the president of the university and the Board of Regents in charged of the university.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.998" offset="439359">Excuse me, did I say the appellants?</text>
            <text syncTime="85.988" offset="447300">I mean the appellees are the Attorney General and the Board of Regents and the president.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.330" offset="472691">The facts are established by the findings of fact of the trial court which are set out on pages 8 and 9 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.131" offset="531937">They show that in 1955, pursuant to a statute that had been passed shortly before the spring of 1955 by the legislature, the appellants were directed by the appellees to execute an oath that they did not belong to the Communist Party or to any other subversive organization as defined in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.072" offset="663698">And they -- it was stated that if they did not sign this oath and the oath is set forth in Appendix C into appellants' brief, they did not sign this oath, they would -- they would lose their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.927" offset="739035">Their employment would be terminated and there would be loss of tenure in retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.033" offset="767457">Now, they, thereupon, filed a petition in the state court for a declaratory judgment seeking an injunction against enforcement of the Act and restraining the insistence on the signing of the oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.635" offset="837883">In this, the petition, it was asserted that a statute, pursuant to which this oath was presented, violated the State and the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.775" offset="906428">Insofar as the Federal Constitution is involved, it was said that there was a denial of due process of law, that there was a -- an abrogation of freedom of speech and assembly and that the statute constituted a bill of a tenure.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.327" offset="992632">Now, I will describe the statute which is charged that the constitutionality of which is challenged, it is set forth at page 5 -- and pages 5 and 6 of our appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.501" offset="1061386">Section 1 of the statute, this is the 1955 statute, says that, "Every department or agency of the State of Washington or of any county or city in the State of Washington, shall require every employee to sign an affidavit as to whether or not he or she belongs to the Communist Party or other subversive organization."</text>
            <text syncTime="271.848" offset="1190745">Now, this is -- this refers to not prior membership, but membership at the time of signing the oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.305" offset="1224600">It goes on to say that "Refusal to answer this -- this question on any grounds, shall be a cause for immediate dismissal from employment."</text>
            <text syncTime="297.604" offset="1293772">Section 4 of the 1955 Act provides that the Communist Party is a subversive organization and that membership in the Communist Party shall be a subversive activity within the meaning of the Act.</text>
