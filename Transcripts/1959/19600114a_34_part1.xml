            <text syncTime="17.206" offset="172178">This case is here on writ of certiorari for the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.736" offset="202271">In general, the case deals with the legality of picketing under the National Labor Relations Act to force an employer to recognize as the bargaining representative of these employees, a union which represents either none of them or only a minority of these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.775" offset="282520">Section 8 (b) (1) (A) of the Act makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents to restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights under Section 7 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.389" offset="340929">Included among these rights is the right of employees to bargain collectively through a representative of their own choosing or to have none at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.437" offset="381158">The question presented in this case is whether a union which pickets to force the employer to recognize it as the bargaining representative of its employees, even though it represents none or only a minority the employees, constitutes restraint and coercion of the employees in the exercise of their statutory rights within the meaning of Section 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="94.601" offset="481782">Now, let me briefly summarize the facts which give rise to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.110" offset="503829">In 1953, the Board certified the respondent union as the bargaining representative of some 21 employees of the Curtis Company who worked as warehousemen, truck drivers and furniture finishers.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.573" offset="561716">The Company is engaged in the retail furniture business.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.925" offset="579062">Shortly after the union was certified by the Board, it entered into negotiations with the Company with the view to working out a collective bargaining contract, but they were unable to arrive with an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.622" offset="625873">The union went out on -- called a strike, in which nine of the 21 employees joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.447" offset="649174">The union established picket lines around the Company's stores, its retail store and the adjoining warehouse where the employees who were involved in this matter worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.760" offset="690448">The Company replaced the nine strikers and continued its operations and the union meanwhile, continued its picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.931" offset="727124">Some 15 months or so later, in 1955, the Company filed a petition with the Board, asking the Board to hold an election to determine whether the employees wished to be represented by the respondent union.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.295" offset="792534">The Board held that election and of the 29 votes that were cast in that election, 28 of the votes were against the union and only one for the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.656" offset="837987">The -- despite its overwhelming defeat at the polls, the union, nevertheless, continued to picket, this time, only in front of the Company store.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.987" offset="887306">The Board found that one of the purposes of the union in continuing to picket and I might say that there is really no question about this finding here, the Board found that one of the purposes of the union in continuing to picket after the election was to compel the employer to recognize it as the representative of the employees, despite the fact, despite the fact that these employees had decisively rejected this union as their -- as their bargaining representative.</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="224.978" offset="1003290">And that was finding (Inaudible)</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="228.960" stopTime="422.522">
            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="228.960" offset="1019173">Well, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.960" offset="1023248">The banners which they said were two kinds, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.308" offset="1036622">Before the election, the banner proclaimed that the Company was on strike and it was unfair to organize labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.909" offset="1067029">After the election, the banners were changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.970" offset="1075284">One of them read, as I recall it, that the Company was unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.112" offset="1087822">It employed nonunion -- nonunion men, working men and the other banner was to the effect that -- that they wanted -- the union wanted employees to join the union, so that they could enjoy, enjoy union working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.852" offset="1154800">But the Board found, and as I said, there's really no challenge here, the Board found that despite whatever the signs may have said or despite the claim of the union that it was not seeking immediate recognition from the employer that the union was in fact, picketing for the purpose of requiring the employer to recognize it, notwithstanding, notwithstanding the fact that these employees had decisively rejected this union as their bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.348" offset="1256782">Now, the Board further found that picketing by a union, which represents either none or only a minority of the employees, to force the employees to accept it as their bargaining representative, constitutes an invasion of the employees' rights under the statute and constitutes restraint and coercion within the meaning of Section 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="312.753" offset="1354376">The Board accordingly entered an order directing the union to refrain from this conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.280" offset="1376528">The court below disagreed with the Board.The court below took the position that Section 8 (b) (1) (A) of the statute was not intended -- was not intended by Congress to reach this kind of picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.934" offset="1427101">And that accordingly, the Board below set aside the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.791" offset="1442565">I may add in passing, that of the three Circuit Courts that have dealt with this issue, they have split out.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.817" offset="1474644">Two of them including the court below in the Second Circuit had disagreed with the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.787" offset="1498572">The -- and the third one which the Fourth Circuit has upheld the Board's views in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.704" offset="1526157">Now, before I go on to discuss the considerations which underlie this controversy, I should like to say, a preliminary word concerning the order of my remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.989" offset="1575372">This case arose under the National Labor Relations Act as amended in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.342" offset="1600763">And the question as I've been to -- as I've indicated, is whether Section 8 (b) (1) (A) of the statute reaches this kind of picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.812" offset="1630647">Now, following the Board decision, as well as the decision of the court below in this case, Congress passed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.509" offset="1653426">I'm sure the Court is aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.294" offset="1660531">Congress passed the 1959 amendments to the statute and included -- included in these amendments is a provision which I'll merely say in general to state it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.515" offset="1709432">The general regulates -- regulates organizational and recognition picketing whether it's by a majority or minority union.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.575" offset="1741720">Now, the Board believes -- the Board believes that these amendments do not affect -- do not affect its conclusions that it reached in this case and further that they do not affect its order.</text>

            <text syncTime="438.097" offset="1855718">And that if the Board's views prevail as to the meaning of Section 8 (b) (1) (A), then its order is entitled to stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.044" offset="2251525">Obviously, the Board did not have the power to deal with this thing here under 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.805" offset="2266572">We never reached the issue of what, the subsequent amendments do.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.507" offset="2281409">And secondly then, I would like to address myself to the significance and the impact of the -- of the 1959 amendments along the lines that I've just suggested to Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.421" offset="2325086">Now, one of the fundamental policies of the statute is to afford to employees full freedom in the selection of a bargaining representative of their own choosing.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.564" offset="2385586">Section 7 implements this policy and guarantees to employees the right to select a bargaining representative for purpose of collective bargaining or to have none at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.456" offset="2433233">The picketing in this case was in defiance of that statutory guarantee for it sought to force upon the employees, a union which it did -- did not want.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.053" offset="2471581">Indeed, one which they had decisively rejected in a Board election.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.338" offset="2488717">If the employer had recognized this union and assisted in forcing it upon the unwilling employees, he would have committed an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.434" offset="2525080">His action in that respect would have constituted restraint and coercion within the meaning of Section 8 (a) (1) of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="612.706" offset="2554232">You mean by that that 8 (b) says, I want to get rid of these pickets and therefore, I would recognize the union, that's what you mean?</text>

            <text syncTime="620.744" offset="2586311">Now, is it in the less restraint or coercion, within the meaning of Section 8 (b) (1) (A), on the part of a union to resort to picketing for the purpose of compelling the employees to surrender their right of self-determination and to conscript the assistance of the employer in shaping this illegal objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.280" offset="2664469">Section 8 (b) (1) (A), as I have said, makes an unfair labor practice for labor organization to restrain or coerce the employees in the exercise of Section 7 rights, including their right of self-determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.634" offset="2713893">The two elements -- the two elements of the offense are, one, that the union's action constitutes restraint and coercion and secondly, that such restraint or coercion cuts in -- cuts into to the employees' right of self-determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.407" offset="2768959">Now, I think there can be no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.325" offset="2776691">Indeed, I don't believe that the other side seriously challenges this, that taking Section 8 (b) (1) (A) literally at least, literally, it can be read -- it can be read to encompass this kind of picketing, where its purpose is as I have said, to override the employees' self-determination in these questions of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.760" offset="2866448">Now, the purpose of the picketing was for the union to force itself upon these unwilling employees and the union sought to achieve that objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.446" offset="2905109">It sought to achieve that objective by threatening the livelihood of the workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.837" offset="2926738">One of the purposes, an obvious purpose of the picketing, of course, was to turn away both customers and suppliers of the Company and to work economic loss upon the Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.138" offset="2971878">And of course, such economic duress -- such economic duress, not only -- not only tends to force the employer's hand and to recognize the union which as an -- not entitled to recognition, but it also tends -- it also tends to force the employees however unwillingly, to forgo their statutory rights and to acquiesce in representation through a union which they do not want.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.726" offset="3070307">Now, it seems to us, Your Honors, there can't be -- that there can't be a more unequivocal way of restraining or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights than to cause them to fear the disappearance of their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.486" offset="3125269">Now, nothing in the statutory policy that seems to us justifies -- justifies removing this kind of picketing, this kind of economic duress from the reach of Section 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="767.545" offset="3173543">One of the foundations of collective bargaining which the statute has adopted is a national policy, either the employees shall be free to select or reject a bargaining representative without employer restraint or union coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.305" offset="3232580">Now, it seems to us, Your Honors, that this kind of picketing, the economic duress, that was behind this kind of picketing, abridges that right of the employees, their right of self-determination and subverts that national policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.392" offset="3284929">Indeed, where as here, you have a Board election and the employees have turned the union down and the union seeks to override the -- the subversion -- the subversion of the -- of the national policies even more flagrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.277" offset="3348459">As even far more flagrant, because the union is seeking to override by means of economic pressure, the employees' deliberate and solemn choice which they have made in the Board election.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.606" offset="3389837">Now, no policy of the statute is -- moreover, I might add, as I've said before that if the employer were to recognize the union in these circumstances, he too would become -- he too would be committing an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.067" offset="3435604">No policy of the statute seems to what is served, by permitting picketing which has these consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.574" offset="3465697">It seems to us that in the absence of any legitimate interest, any legitimate competing interest of the contrary and we submit, there is none, there is no reason why Section 8 (b) (1) (A) should not be given unqualified effect to reach this kind of picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.226" offset="3520240">It seems to us that the statutory policy is almost required.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.978" offset="3539257">Now, let me turn, I've spoken about the literal language of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) and, of course, I'm fully aware that we don't stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.605" offset="3565798">Let me turn now to the legislative history of Section 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="873.573" offset="3597667">This history has been set out in full in our brief and I will not attempt to retrace it step by step.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.369" offset="3624835">I'm sure that each side will be able to quote some scripture to its purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.558" offset="3641553">Indeed, one court has recently said that perhaps the legislative history of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) is inconclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.229" offset="3668302">But I believe, Your Honor, that there are three hard and meaningful facts that do emerge -- that do emerge from this legislative background of Section 8 (b) (1) (A), which, I think, are significant for our purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.734" offset="3722324">The first of these is that the sponsors of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) intended to impose upon unions, insofar as it was practical, the same kind of restrictions which Section 8 (a) (1) already imposed upon employers, with respect to employer-intrusion upon protected employee interest or rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.996" offset="3799333">Section 8 (b) (1) (A) was intended to vest in the Board the same broad power that deal with union restraint or coercion that the Board already possessed with respect to employer restraint or coercion which trenched upon the employees' rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.902" offset="3858996">Now, this -- the parallel purpose -- the parallel purpose of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) and Section 8 (a) (1), I think, is significant for our purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.589" offset="3905703">An employer who forces upon his employees a union which they do not want, an employer who exerts economic pressure to force the employees to accept an -- an unwanted union, he commits an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.631" offset="3961919">Such recognition -- such or a -- such economic duress from the part of the employers is a classic example of restraint and coercion in violation of Section 8 (a) (1) -- of the Section 8 (a) (1) provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.697" offset="4002147">Now, the union's action in this case is the counterpart of that employer action.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.786" offset="4022523">For both types of actions involved, they involve economic pressure for the purpose of achieving the same illegal objective, the denial of the employees of their right of self-determination in these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.400" offset="4076962">Now, it seems to us, that if 8 (b) (1) (A) is to -- and 8 (a) (1) are to be given the intended evenhanded application that the sponsors or the -- of the sponsors of the -- of this -- of this provision intended, then there's no reason for differentiating between economic pressure by a union or economic pressure by an employer, where the purpose of that kind of pressure is to settle the employees, the unwilling employees with a union that they do not want.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.015" offset="4183437">In either case, well, it seems to us, you have restraint or coercion in violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.419" offset="4205066">Now, secondly, the second major -- the second fact that I think does emerge form the legislative history which is of some significance is that Senator Taft and Senator Ball, who among the principal sponsors of Section 8 (b) (1) (A), made it clear that they intended 8 (b) (1) (A) to reach, both stranger and minority picketing for the purpose of compelling an employer to grant them recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.153" offset="4320005">They illustrated the reach of Section 8 (b) (1) (A), during the debates as follows, Senator Taft said --</text>

            <text syncTime="1065.041" offset="4363577">I'm now -- I'm now reading from page 29 of our brief, Your Honor, where it's quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.583" offset="4381654">As the union went to a plant in California and said, “We want to organize your employees, call them in and tell them to join our union."</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.427" offset="4413106">The employer said, "We have not any control over our employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.203" offset="4428152">We cannot tell them under the Act, under National Labor Relations Act -- we cannot tell them under the National Labor Relations Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.951" offset="4455215">They said, "If you don't, we will picket your plant," and they did picket it and closed it down for a couple of months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.166" offset="4480084">And then we go on to say, he concluded with a statement that there are plenty of methods of coercion, short of actual physical violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.435" offset="4505161">And again Senator Ball, who was as I say one of the principal sponsors of this legislation, he illustrated the reach of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) with this example, and again, the same page, Your Honors, of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.895" offset="4555003">He said that, “That was intended to reach the case where the Teamsters Local 86 had been picketing an establishment, although no members of the union were employed there in an effort to coerce those who were employed there into joining a union, which they did not want to join.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.112" offset="4623862">Now finally, the third fact -- the third fact that I think has significance for us does emerge from this legislative background is this, when Section 8 (b) (1) (A) was being debated on the Senate floor, some misgivings work expressed that perhaps Section 8 (b) (1) (A) might be read to cover peaceful persuasion or peaceful picketing for -- peaceful picketing for legitimate purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.270" offset="4744443">Senator Taft assured these -- assured these Senators, assured these Senators that 8 (b) (1) (A) was not intended to reach that kind of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.144" offset="4783940">But nevertheless, the sponsors of the bill, they never wavered -- they never wavered from their view -- from their view that Section 8 (b) (1) (A) was intended to reach -- was intended to be given as broad, a meaning, as broad as interpretation as Section 8 (a) (1) had received in protecting employers against intrusion with respect to their rights through employer coercion or through union restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.313" offset="4888639">Now, I think finally, it is instructed, it is instructed to look to the circumstances which gave birth to Section 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.398" offset="4928972">The House bill, though which had passed the House, contained some very broad provisions concerning organizational and -- and recognition of picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.878" offset="4978918">The House bill prohibited picketing, where there was no dispute between the employer and his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.196" offset="5004204">It prohibited picketing to compel an employer to recognize the union, which had not been certified by the Board and finally, it prohibited picketing to compel an employer to violate any law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.645" offset="5049971">The Senate bill, the bill which had been reported of the Senate Committee, contained no similar provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.330" offset="5072645">The only provision that the Senate bill contained in this area was the provision which subsequently -- eventually became Section 8 (b) (4) (C) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.305" offset="5108590">And 8 (b) (4) (C) makes an unfair labor practice to engage in picketing for the purpose of displacing, for the purpose of displacing a union which has been certified by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.764" offset="5150386">Now, when the Senate bill was reported out of the Committee, five members of the Committee expressed concern that the Senate bill didn't -- has against the -- as reported out the Committee, did not go far enough -- did not go far enough in regulating union organizational activity and particularly as the sponsor stated, did not go far enough in regulating minority or stranger picketing for the purposes of obtaining recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.479" offset="5253308">Now, it was to remedy that deficiency, it was to remedy that deficiency that 8 (b) (1) (A), that 8 (b) (1) (A) was proposed and in part, the intention was to bring into the Senate bill, to bring into the Senate bill albeit in a somewhat modified form, some of the restrictions of the House bill contained with respect to picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.523" offset="5333452">And it was with this understanding, it was with this understanding that the Conference Committee, the Conference adopted the bill -- approved the bill and of course, then the bill was passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1333.378" offset="5436897">Now, to conclude the legislative history, we think, we think that taking the legislative history as a whole, that it supports and then a strong support to the Board's interpretation of Section 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.157" offset="5496038">Now, in essence, this is our affirmative case, so I will now turn to the case on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.229" offset="5524250">The other side contends that there are specific provisions, 8 (b) (4) (C) among them, in the statute which evidenced a congressional intention not to reach this kind of picketing under Section 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.804" offset="5582555">And, of course, the principal source of this argument is Section 8 (b) (4) (C), which, as I have stated, Section 8 (b) (4) (C) makes an unfair labor practice for a union to picket for the purpose of displacing a certified union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.536" offset="5633546">Now, the argument is that the inference to be drawn, the inference from -- to be drawn from the specific regulation of recognition picketing is that Congress, as a matter of deliberate choice, refrained from imposing any further restrictions upon other types of recognition picketing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1445.159" offset="5884008">And as I've already indicated, Section 8 (b) (1) (A) was inserted in the statute because of misgivings or concern expressed by the Committee members that the bill which already included Section 8 (b) (4) (C), did not go far enough in -- in the regulation, in the regulation of organizational activities on the part of the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="1756.345" offset="7128795">Now, the argument is made on this phase of the case is that picketing is a base of strike action, that Section 8 (b) (1) (A) does not specifically cover picketing and that therefore, the immunity that Section 13 gives to strike and by hypothesis to picketing, cannot be, cannot be denied under -- under Section 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>

            <text syncTime="1808.074" offset="7335685">Section 8 (b) (2), for example, makes an unfair labor practice for a union to cause or to attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against his employees in violation of the statute.</text>
