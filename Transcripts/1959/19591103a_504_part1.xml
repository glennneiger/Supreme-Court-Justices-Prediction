            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 504 United Steelworkers of America, Petitioner, versus the United States, et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.760" offset="146369">Counsels, may I -- may I say to you that because of the cooperation which the counsels of both parties has been shown throughout the proceedings and travelled through the lower courts to this Court, we feel that there would be no need of putting the time limits to the arguments (Inaudible)</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="64.854" stopTime="582.650">
            <label>Mr. Arthur J. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="64.854" offset="362768">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.588" offset="385755">I have the honor to represent the petitioner, the United Steelworkers of America in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.210" offset="420237">This Court has granted certiorari from the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit affirming the injunction order issued by the District Judge for the Western District of Pennsylvania, Judge Sorg.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.058" offset="499649">In order to understand the issues, statutory, equitable, and constitutional involved, it is necessary that I give some of the background facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.064" offset="567672">United Steelworkers of America, the petitioner, is a labor organization representing approximately 1,250,000 workers engaged in the steel and fabricating industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.522" offset="645413">There are involved in the strike which will be the subject to the Court's attention, more than 500,000 members of the union, the employees of the defendant company.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.384" offset="704867">It is important for me to call your attention to the fact that the Steelworkers Union has separate agreements with the companies which are likewise parties-defendant to this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.555" offset="765576">Originally, there were 97 companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.358" offset="784802">One of the companies was dismissed by agreement in the District Court and one of the companies, the Kaiser Steel Corporation was dismissed by stipulation in the Court of Appeals, following a settlement of the dispute with the union which took place after the case was decided in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.651" offset="890023">It is also necessary for me to point out because I shall advert to it later, that the union is separately certified as the bargaining agent with respect to each of these companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.338" offset="948746">And in fact in many of these companies, they're certified not on a company basis but even on a plant basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.579" offset="993677">The contracts with the companies, who are at bar, the collective agreements expired by and large with few exceptions on June 30th, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.044" offset="1059506">At the request of President Eisenhower, an extension of these agreements was made for a period of 14 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.088" offset="1099734">And following the expiration of the extension agreements with the defendant companies, strikes occurred, and I emphasize strikes not a strike, strikes occurred at the different plants and companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.949" offset="1179146">The record shows without contradiction and it is uncontroverted that the strikes which occurred resulted in a shutdown of 310 steel plants, of a 118 iron ore companies and of shipping and other transportation facilities connected with the basic steel industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.948" offset="1287189">Now, these companies who are at bar, originally, before the Kaiser settlement produced 84 and 6/10th percent of the total steel capacity of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.916" offset="1359078">I might point out to you and it appears in the record that the present steel capacity of the United States is 140,633,000 odd tons of steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.554" offset="1421563">These are ingot tons.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.580" offset="1433684">In the steel making process approximately 20% to 30% of ingot tons is lost in the finishing process of finished steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.255" offset="1484361">This is not completely lost because with the great technological development in steel, this steel which is lost is reduced to scrap.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.471" offset="1521246">It is called the internal scrap in the steel industry, it goes back into the furnaces and again constitutes part of the essential process of making steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.603" offset="1573804">It is likewise important to note that at the time this lawsuit was filed an excess of 15%, 15.36% to be exact, of the total capacity of the steel industry embracing some 63 companies were not struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.064" offset="1659591">The majority of these operated under agreements with the Steelworkers Union expiring on different dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.456" offset="1689161">Some of them had the extension agreements, and a few of these companies were not organized or represented by the Steelworkers Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.483" offset="1733256">Now, these companies are not insubstantial in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.694" offset="1750183">They have a total capacity of 20 -- 22,683,480 tons.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.831" offset="1790725">And these figures become relevant in connection with a discussion of the evidence a little later in the course of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.637" offset="1829909">Now, as I mentioned earlier, following the commencement to these proceedings, the Kaiser Steel Corporation settled with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.477" offset="1869302">This company, one of the 12 largest companies in the steel industry, has a capacity of about 2% of the total steel production of the United States or approximately 3 million tons.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.245" offset="1936384">So there has been added to the present capacity not on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.255" offset="1968358">These 3 million tons that we may then in round numbers assert that the companies not on strike produce and are capable of producing approximately 25 million tons of steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.903" offset="2038993">It is also relevant to note that the production before the strike from January 1st to July 14th on the part of the companies, they were all not on strike at that time, was an extraordinary production.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.355" offset="2112763">None in the companies produced in anticipation of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.917" offset="2135019">In any event, for the first nine months of this year, the record shows that the total steel production of the United States amounted to 72,479,609 tons, and this of course is supplemented by imports of steel into the United States which would be an addition to this amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.246" offset="2256332">There are three months yet unaccounted for in our summary of steel production, and even if the strike were to go on, and we hope and pray it won't, for the balance of the three months, it is interesting to note that the total production for the year 1959 will be very close to equal the entire non-strike year of 1958 for the whole industry, which amounted to 85,254,885 tons.</text>

            <text syncTime="823.194" offset="3396106">Under that statute, the President issued an executive order, 10843, which is set forth on page 9 of the record of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1596.048" offset="6487542">On the same -- on the same afternoon, following this, the District Judge permitted a short stay of the injunction order to enable me to present my application for a further stay to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1675.515" offset="6805400">Judge Staley at that time asked whether the Government and ourselves were prepared to proceed next morning to Philadelphia to present an application to the full -- to a panel of the full court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1811.661" offset="7350000">We argued the case orally, and in the course of the argument, a question of the stay, Judge Hastie inquired as to whether the stay should continue on paragraph five of the injunction order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.005" offset="7419382">This was a paragraph of the injunction order following the statute, which requires the parties to bargain with each other during the continuation of the injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2201.616" offset="8909824">One, findings of the District Court as to national health and safety were based on an erroneous reading of the statute, and even if that reading were accepted, which I don't think should be done, were unsupported by the evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.486" offset="9009298">Two, the judgment of the below, judgment below, should be reversed even if the Government met the burden of proving that health and safety were imperiled, because on the equities of this case and the reasonable exercise of the equity, the injunction should have been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.462" offset="9109191">And three, the 80-day injunction provisions of the statute are unconstitutional as they confer on the District Courts duties which are not judicial and are not connected with any case in controversy and are therefore outside the limits of Article III Section 2 of the Judiciary Clause of the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2434.364" offset="9840828">And it is not pertinent here, and except as I shall later point out that the Board of Inquiry made no finding on the national emergency issue and I, myself, think this is a proper reading of the statute that it shall not, although many boards of inquiry had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.269" offset="9928495">That Dr. Taylor, when he convened this board of inquiry, made a statement that he does not regard this to be disfunction, because he says that his function is to ascertain the facts with respect to the causes and circumstances of the dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2628.534" offset="10617501">When the District Court issues the order, then it's the duty of the parties to make every effort to adjust and settle their differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.316" offset="10652609">That it was this part of the injunction order which after suggestion of Judge Hastie was not stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.364" offset="10684792">Then there's another procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.393" offset="10696913">Upon the issuance of such order, the President shall reconvene the board of inquiry which has previously reported with respect to the dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2677.800" offset="10814568">We have been reading here the last few days under the auspices of the mediation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.946" offset="10843199">At the end of a 60-day period, unless the dispute has been settled by that time, the board of inquiry shall report to the President the current position of the parties, offers which have been made for settlement, and shall include a statement by each party of its position, and statement, if there's something new of the employers' last offer of settlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2712.477" offset="10953331">There we have the National Labor Relations Board within the succeeding 15 days shall take a secret ballot of the employees of each employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.627" offset="10997844">So in this great dispute a ballot would have to be taken separately for each company on the question of whether they wish to accept the final offer of settlement made by their employer as stated by him and shall certify the results with the Attorney General within eight days thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.962" offset="11079241">Now you, -- with five days thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.004" offset="11087391">Now you notice that if the strike is settled beforehand, this procedure does not follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.204" offset="11116231">And we will later see that in the next section, the Attorney General must discharge an injunction as, in effect, he did at the Kaiser Steel Corporation when a settlement was reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.445" offset="11161161">Then the following, on the final paragraph, upon certification of the results of such ballot or upon a settlement being reached, whichever happen sooner, the Attorney General shall move the Court, here we come to mandatory language, to discharge the injunction, which motion shall then be granted and the injunction discharged And then, because it's conceivable, the strike might still be resumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.839" offset="11282683">And a final step in this procedure, when such a motion is granted, the President shall submit to the Congress a full and comprehensive report of the proceedings including the findings of the board of inquiry and the ballot taken by the National Labor Relations Board together with such recommendations that he may see fit to make for consideration and appropriate action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.530" offset="11385501">This has been properly called the 80-day injunction section.</text>

            <text syncTime="2828.142" offset="11415907">It maybe as it was in Kaiser a few days, depending upon whether the matter is settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.952" offset="11447150">Now this is a very involved procedure involving President, the Attorney General, the federal courts, the conciliation service, the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.439" offset="11509112">And if Your Honor will permit a note of congressional humor in this situation, the minority in the House criticizing this emergency section in a -- little earlier version but not substantially different, the House, Minority Report number 245 said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.106" offset="11579747">“Under Sections 203 and 204 the President, the Attorney General, the district courts, the Secretary of Labor”, he was put out of this in the final version, “the Office of Conciliation, the Administrator of the National Labor Relations Act, the Circuit Court of Appeals, and special boards would all be concerned with the handling of the most vital disputes in the country affecting the national health and safety.</text>

            <text syncTime="2910.725" offset="11746304">And here on health and safety, we come to one of the substantial parts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.018" offset="11775457">And our argument here can be briefly summarized this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.599" offset="11793742">Acquisition of jurisdiction by the District Court in the case and its issuance of the injunction were based upon two determinations made by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.793" offset="11850585">And this relates to the findings of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.264" offset="11864377">One, national health in the sense of economic well-being will be imperiled, because the steel strike will adversely effect business, idle workers and facilities dependent upon steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.538" offset="11941491">This is apparent, if you will look at the findings, on page 247.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.476" offset="11973256">And I refer you specifically to the finding (E) where the District Judge, at the request of the Government which likewise adopted the theory that economic well-being is synonymous with national health, really find that a continuation of the strike will have the ultimate effect of adversely affecting, millions of small business enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.814" offset="12098644">Almost all of which are directly or indirectly dependent upon steel products and most of which lack the resources to stock large amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.950" offset="12135215">And additionally, will have the effect of idling millions of worker and a large proportion of facilities and industries dependent upon steel for their continued operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.145" offset="12175966">Manufacturing industries dependent on steel products, account for the employment of approximately 6 million workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.579" offset="12201671">Their normal wages and salaries total proximity $34 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.954" offset="12219225">Products of these industries are valued at over a $125 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.632" offset="12237928">The national health will be in imperiled if strike is permitted to continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.859" offset="12258826">I shall, in a moment, address myself to whether that is a correct reading of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="4312.786" offset="17354480">I said that originally 23 million tons of steel were being produced by non-struck companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.503" offset="17385409">This has been added to now by Kaiser two, two, a little over two, on 23 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.354" offset="17412786">So that's 25 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.002" offset="17423339">What are the defense needs in terms of steel of the United States as demonstrated here by uncontroverted evidence in the affidavits?</text>
            <text syncTime="4341.362" offset="17468792">Less than 1% of the total steel produced in United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.423" offset="17505050">In terms of finished steel, as contrasted with our capacity of 147 million tons, as contrasted with production now going on of 25 million tons, as contrasted with the production of the first six months much of which went into inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.088" offset="17595747">As contrasted with steel which is coming in from abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.292" offset="17612570">As my friends in the industry say it's overwhelming us, which we have denied, but taking all these together, all of this of all types for defense use have never exceeded in their past couple of years and they've fallen below 700,000 tons of steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.760" offset="17718418">Now we go on to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4411.070" offset="17747675">Steel, as Your Honors probably know, is generally of two or three basic types.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.730" offset="17778291">We must -- we must give the Government all that it has to say in this area in all fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.906" offset="17802951">Steel consists of various types.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.361" offset="17812773">The great bulk of steel production in the United States is carbon steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.269" offset="17832417">This is produced in generally in open hearth furnaces.</text>
            <text syncTime="4437.237" offset="17852270">It's carbon steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.640" offset="17861883">The open hearths also produce some low-alloy steels.</text>
            <text syncTime="4445.761" offset="17886438">In fact in the ore, they produce quite a bit of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4450.428" offset="17905037">The specialty steels, this is what appears in the Government affidavits is there a need and claim, the specialty steels.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.386" offset="17940877">These are high-alloy steels are made in the industry of what is called -- what are called electric furnaces.</text>
            <text syncTime="4468.543" offset="17977553">Now we have been trying throughout these proceedings, we've criticized the Government's affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4476.928" offset="18011094">It's not telling us what plants, where, how, what type of steel, other than the general statement specialized steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.730" offset="18050278">And so we have been forced to make our own analysis from public resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.237" offset="18072325">And if you will look at our brief, you will find an appendix from sources of which this Court can take judicial notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4503.018" offset="18115480">And you will find in this appendix page, starting at Appendix F, the availability of special steel is needed from military aircraft and missile purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4517.271" offset="18172426">And if you look at table 1 on page 87, you'll find that the companies not on strike, while they represent now 17% of the steel capacity, there are in many areas the electric furnace producers of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4537.555" offset="18253615">And they have 35% of the total electric furnace capacity of the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.913" offset="18291022">Now just the other day, I believe it was October the 26th, there was a publication which we have filed with the Court which lists defense orders and we have made an analysis of that and we find that in virtually every instance, the type of steel required is being made by the companies not on strike, or they are capable of making.</text>
            <text syncTime="4583.495" offset="18437308">This is a document published by the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4586.665" offset="18450056">And I might say to Your Honors for your own information, we ask the -- the defense department and the persons in charge for a statement of what companies were involved, and I will later, on the discretion argument, make an argument about that, about our desire to cooperate to produce this material.</text>

            <text syncTime="4885.926" offset="19647091">Suppose that in the steel industry, there is one company employing 5000 people that produces items and it's in the steel industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4901.019" offset="19707486">It's a steel company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.372" offset="19712815">It produces an alloy steel required for national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.086" offset="19731728">This statute does not permit an injunction to be issued to put that plant at work under the injunction process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4918.724" offset="19778226">I want to make that as emphatic as I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.253" offset="19792436">To do that, it would be to misread the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4925.253" offset="19804348">This is not what the congressional favors of the statute meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4930.977" offset="19827231">They were talking in terms of the industry or substantial part of the industry, strike there imperiling the health or safety of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4940.862" offset="19866833">Now I want to add something very hastily.</text>
            <text syncTime="4944.110" offset="19879790">Is our country defenses under this situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="4948.604" offset="19897762">It's a legitimate concern to all of us, although it might be a -- it's probably a congressional concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="4953.773" offset="19918451">But Congress has acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.026" offset="19927437">Congress has acted in this area not by injunction, but just a fatal fallacy of the Government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4963.986" offset="19959306">Congress has at least three statutes which bear on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.492" offset="19985324">One is the Selective Service Act of 1948 as Your Honors had occasion to consider in the Steel Seizure case in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="4988.025" offset="20055437">Now in the several opinions of the Steel Seizure case, Mr. Justice Clark, you talked about it at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="4995.274" offset="20084485">Mr. Justice Jackson talked about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4998.789" offset="20098487">The Selective Service Act says specifically that if there is a commodity and it refers specifically to steel at one stage, necessary for the defense of our country, and if the employer refuses or fails to produce it, then the Government may seize that instrumentality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5028.944" offset="20219173">And that's a statutory seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5031.437" offset="20229099">That is not the seizure under the alleged implied powers that this Court dealt with in the Youngstown versus Sawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.714" offset="20262222">Now the Government has the means if an employer is disabled because of the strike, to seize that plant and put it back into production.</text>

            <text syncTime="5072.093" offset="20391790">The next statute which is available, Government has three -- three vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.859" offset="20430764">There's the Defense Production Act of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.606" offset="20461798">The Defense Production Act of 1950 authorizes two procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5096.059" offset="20487607">One is that it permits the Government if needed for defense purposes to establish priorities, to allocate, to require the production of defense items.</text>
            <text syncTime="5114.299" offset="20560541">Now it's interesting to see in reference to the Government's concept that you'd have to act in the way it acted here by enjoining a nationwide strike and disputes between many companies by injunction order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.293" offset="20632534">It's interesting to see what the Government did with its powers under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.960" offset="20655208">The Government for the first month of the strike did nothing under the Defense Production Act except send a letter or issue an order advising all companies not struck to keep the Government advised as to what they were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.199" offset="20732217">That's all they did there for the first period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5160.532" offset="20745488">They didn't do anything further until October the 16th after the Board of Inquiry had acted, after I made an argument before the Board of Inquiry on this subject pointing to the Defense Production Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5177.701" offset="20814137">And on October 16th, they finally issued an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.681" offset="20834095">And the order is primarily designed to assure, as the Government says frankly in its brief that when the struck plants go back into operation, that defense orders will have priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.992" offset="20891355">That's not the primary design of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5199.688" offset="20902118">Now let's contrast this with the action of the Government which we have an affidavit on, in the 1956 strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.226" offset="20928240">In 1956, we had a strike in 1956, the 20th day of that strike, not the 90th day, the Government issued a freeze order on steel in the non-struck plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5224.931" offset="21003055">So that specialty, and these were all specialty steels, so that they would have access to that steel and could allocate it anywhere that they wanted to for processing by contractors of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.593" offset="21065749">Now finally on this subject, there's another provision, and that is this, under the Defense Production Act, the Government may -- the President may solicit the voluntary agreement of labor and management to fulfill the purposes of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5261.343" offset="21148714">We have an affidavit on our reply which is uncontradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5266.038" offset="21167522">But where the Government solicited the -- the cooperation of the Steelworkers Union to move goods out of struck plants that cooperation has been forthcoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="5281.079" offset="21227708">Now we have letters from -- a letter from the admiral in charge for procurement of the navy certifying that this is so.</text>

            <text syncTime="5502.262" offset="22112423">The facts are that at the present moment there are about three million people unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5513.467" offset="22157249">500,000 are steel workers 250,000 at the time of the filing a suit, are workers unemployed so it appears from the record because of the shutdown in steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5528.136" offset="22215868">Now the judge, looking to the future based upon one of these affidavits, says that in the findings, by the end of the year, it has to be served, because we'd hope the strike will be settled before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.002" offset="22283368">But he says by the end of the year, the unemployment including unemployed steel workers may arise to two million or thereabouts, that's two million and a quarter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.772" offset="22338435">We'd have unemployed by this thesis of five million and a quarter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.947" offset="22363199">And in addition, we have some economic reports made by one of the Government's own witnesses, the Government document which I want to advert to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5575.230" offset="22404263">In the last year, we had unemployed of five and a half million, more than that, and it was not asserted that the national health or safety was in peril -- imperiled.</text>
            <text syncTime="5591.098" offset="22467793">We don't like unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5592.440" offset="22473122">We've been very articulated in the labor movement about unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.439" offset="22493080">But it is a far cry for the Government to argue that this state of unemployment imperils the national health of the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="5984.603" offset="24041827">And third, that the balancing of the equity, if I'm wrong about the what we might call the selective reopening, that the balance of the equities in this case, would have justified withholding of an injunction or at most an injunction limited to a tiny fraction of the several struck plants which might be required to satisfy shortages to safety purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="6063.382" offset="24356864">Now in all the industry, the various parts in the plant sometimes are activated without the other parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6071.690" offset="24390092">The firm may not have enough furnace capacity and they use its rolling capacity by getting ingots from other plants and this is possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="6095.465" offset="24485282">And the statute talks in terms of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6101.026" offset="24507434">It doesn't mandate the District Judge to issue the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6109.436" offset="24541080">It does not say, “shall enjoin”.</text>

            <text syncTime="6126.297" offset="24608580">And that's a vital distinction, because it gives him the jurisdiction of a court of equity free from the limitations of the Norris-LaGuardia Act but to a limited extent prescribed in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="6744.911" offset="27083003">But I think it quite apparent that if as I think this record plainly indicates that a small member of the steel mills could be involved if that's far less drastic and a chance for balancing the equity which is his responsibility can properly use that in his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6766.100" offset="27167744">And this seems to me, these are the elements, it seems to me that entered, these three elements that entered into this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6776.112" offset="27207868">But the fact of the matter is, you don't' have to go that far here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6781.871" offset="27230856">We have a court that did not exercise any discretion and we have a right to have the Court exercise this discretion, (Inaudible), we have a court which did not exercise any discretion as the record plainly shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="6799.876" offset="27302849">Now I would like to turn to the last leg of the argument, the constitutional argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6807.168" offset="27332002">It's our position that the 80-day injunction provisions are unconstitutional as they confer on the Court's duties which are not judicial and are not connected with any case that comes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6823.876" offset="27398875">And here I raise what I believe to be a very serious fundamental question which the Court has not reached has not properly reached with the case is decided under other facets of my argument, but is reached if the other facets of my argument are held against me.</text>
            <text syncTime="6846.870" offset="27490826">The -- I don't have to deliver the point that this Court and federal courts are to engage in a judicial function, and their judicial function is adjudicating justiciable controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6867.380" offset="27572851">And it is my position that this statute that bears upon the Court not judicial function but makes the Court part of an administrative process to settle strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6885.834" offset="27646725">And this is not the function of the federal courts, the constitutional courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6895.052" offset="27683610">Now the plain fact of the matter to leave the congressional history here on any fair reading is that Congress did not intend the courts to adjudicate any rights or compel the performance of any duties but the Act is part of the machinery that they were creating to define and settle the labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6922.095" offset="27791757">And here the Government -- and we clash directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6927.604" offset="27813804">We say that Congress did not create a substantive right of the United States and the public to be free from a work stoppage affecting the national health and safety, and providing a judicial remedy to comply with its duties to end such a stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6947.203" offset="27892172">Now there are provisions in the Taft-Hartley Act which define cooling off period.</text>
            <text syncTime="6954.537" offset="27921533">This is popularly called the cooling off period.</text>
            <text syncTime="6958.657" offset="27938043">In 8 (d) of the statute, there are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="6962.797" offset="27954552">We have got to give the Mediation Service 30 days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6967.787" offset="27974510">We got to give the parties 60 days notice before we can strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="6972.752" offset="27994363">And it would be unlawful, the parties have recourse against them in the event, we did not comply with those provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6983.604" offset="28037831">Now Congress knew what it was doing when it enacted those provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6991.232" offset="28068342">But here, what Congress did was faced with an unpopular decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="7001.433" offset="28109093">The question of legislation whether the solution to a national emergency dispute is to make it an obligation on the union alone not to strike, or to do something about the substantive issue that might be more equitable to both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="7024.475" offset="28201253">Congress did not decide that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="7028.231" offset="28216299">It was within the competence of the Congress to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="7031.687" offset="28230092">It was the duty of the Congress to decide, but on the popular parlance, they passed the buck to the Supreme Court to break the strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="7063.255" offset="28356420">Now let me demonstrate by again recourse to the cases that there is no conceivable way if there was a duty of my distinguished friend, the Solicitor General says can be applied from the statute, the jurisdiction of grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="7083.532" offset="28437504">And there are cases where jurisdictional grant implies duty that has been decided by this Court, but there is no way we can comply with our duty which the Government assert exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="7099.059" offset="28499571">No way, and I will again refer to my prior experience in the American Locomotive.</text>
            <text syncTime="7105.138" offset="28523917">There was a strike which threatened to imperil the national safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="7111.458" offset="28549204">For 280 days, the union voluntarily complied with request from the President to postpone that strike, 280 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="7128.595" offset="28617749">At the end of the period, we were enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="7131.542" offset="28629556">We were enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="7133.731" offset="28638333">We have no way of complying at all with this alleged duty which is owing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7143.344" offset="28676786">Now if Congress had intended to make the decision, it could have done it very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="7154.073" offset="28719626">It could have said that as there is in the Railway Labor Act, as there was in the Thomas Luzinski Bill offered in 1959, that after a finding at 49, that after a finding by the President or some competent body, that after a declaration by the President, that it is the duty of the union or the company as the case maybe to remain at work, and then of course the courts could have adjudicated whether or not the union complied with that duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="7192.465" offset="28873226">But here, here there is one thing done and that is this that -- that the injunction for the first time which creates the obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7211.574" offset="28949713">Now this Court many times, has said that on constitutional issues, you must exercise caution, give deference to the acts of Congress, but the one area where this Court has been most vigilant to scrutinize the acts of Congress is this area where the judicial power is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="7238.380" offset="29056920">And this stands both from Article III and from the great concept of separation of powers upon which our Government depends.</text>
            <text syncTime="7252.896" offset="29114911">Now we ought not to assume, we ought not to assume duties here that can't be complied.</text>
            <text syncTime="7263.195" offset="29156185">We cannot imply duties that cannot be complied.</text>
            <text syncTime="7269.988" offset="29183352">We ought not to test with the courts the functions which properly belong to the legislature or the Executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="7280.111" offset="29223790">And this is what this statute does on any plain reading of its terms and it cannot be read otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="7290.697" offset="29266108">It is the injunction which for the first time will create a duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="7297.911" offset="29295052">It is interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="7299.398" offset="29301008">And when I queried the distinguished Assistant Attorney General in our trial in the District Court, and I asked him, “Is it your contention that the Steelworkers Union has violated any duty owing to anybody?”</text>
            <text syncTime="7319.242" offset="29380315">The answer of the Assistant Attorney General was very plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="7334.211" offset="29440188">It's in the record too.</text>
            <text syncTime="7341.440" offset="29469132">And I agree with him, it's 158 of the record that this union has not violated or been remiss in any legal duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="7357.522" offset="29533497">Now there -- this Court has -- has considered this problem in many areas, Government cites good many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="7368.097" offset="29575711">I want to say a word about these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="7372.235" offset="29592325">I find that I am only troubled really by one.</text>
            <text syncTime="7377.213" offset="29612178">Generally, cases cited by the Government are cases were first the Brinson case where the courts held that a -- there was a duty under the law for witnesses to respond to a spree of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7396.406" offset="29688978">That's a judicial function based upon a prescribed duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="7401.764" offset="29710399">Government cites Douds, the Labor Board case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7406.308" offset="29728580">But there the statute defined the unfair labor practice and the Court has a right and the Court so held, not this Court but the Court of Appeals, that the Court could enter an order, a preliminary order, enjoining the unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="7423.286" offset="29796498">But that was prescribed by statute and there was a duty, a duty that you could have avoided that by not committing the unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="7433.342" offset="29836727">Government cites a case of eminent domain that all common law lawyers know that eminent domain was a common law right, well recognized in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7447.295" offset="29892524">Frankly Your Honors, I am troubled by one case in this area, and that's the Tudor case, a naturalization case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7457.991" offset="29935365">And I could make an argument in this Court on Tudor saying that the statute sets forth some duties, which a person desiring naturalization must comply with.</text>
            <text syncTime="7471.695" offset="29990118">But frankly as I read Judge Brandeis's decision in that, Mr. Justice Brandeis's decision in that case, I come to the conclusion in my own mind that that case is a sport, derived from the fact that this function has been performed by the federal courts in 1795.</text>
            <text syncTime="7492.451" offset="30073187">And when you have a case of that character, special in character, I don't think that that case ought to be extended to open the federal courts to functions which the federal courts should not, under the Constitution, perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="7515.235" offset="30164302">And I -- this leads me to a final observation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="7520.752" offset="30186350">And this has to do with matter that Mr. Justice Frankfurter you queried me about and said I would cover in detail later.</text>
            <text syncTime="7529.238" offset="30220309">What is the judicial function involved in making the determinations which has to be made in this case if an injunction is to issue?</text>
            <text syncTime="7540.542" offset="30265553">And on this record these are the determinations which a court of equity is required to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="7549.087" offset="30299721">It will weaken our position in the cold war.</text>
            <text syncTime="7553.154" offset="30316022">It seems to me that that's a function for Congress and the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="7556.861" offset="30330859">But you're required to make that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7559.089" offset="30339741">This was one of the arguments that the Government advances, which the court finds.</text>
            <text syncTime="7566.564" offset="30369625">We will be in a bad way with our allies in the NATO alliance, that some undefined time in the future we'll have so much unemployment that it will imperil the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="7580.070" offset="30423646">These are findings that this Court is supposed to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="7587.819" offset="30454680">It's interesting to me that when we get into the question of whether we will jeopardize our relations with our allies and imperil -- imperil the -- our alliances, the one who makes that affidavit is not our Secretary of State but the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, what his confidence in this -- in this area, I'm at a loss to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="7618.560" offset="30577664">And then, you are asked, and the District Court is asked to make in an assessment of our defense situation in light of the steel structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="7631.857" offset="30630849">Is our defense program going to be delayed?</text>
            <text syncTime="7636.553" offset="30649553">Is that an assessment for this Court to make or the District Court, even assuming that we cross-examine witnesses?</text>
            <text syncTime="7645.551" offset="30685602">There is no doubt in my mind and this is in further answer to the affidavit question.</text>
            <text syncTime="7650.876" offset="30706918">There is no doubt in my mind had we pressed that point, we would have been met with an argument of classified information.</text>
            <text syncTime="7659.201" offset="30740146">That isn't a speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7661.043" offset="30747564">I was met with it in the American Locomotive case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7666.548" offset="30769612">It seems to me these are not determinations for a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7672.257" offset="30792391">These are determinations that are properly made by a chief executive or by a congress or at most by an administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="7685.304" offset="30844635">And the Government it seems to me concedes much when trying to justify this type of procedure that says, but look at the Labor Board and the SEC and the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="7868.334" offset="31576691">In our opinion, no union ought to be compelled to terminate the strike which for 80 days amounts in the equivalent to almost a permanent order in the history of labor injunctions on the basis that if evidence is fragmentary, as the Government has ought.</text>
            <text syncTime="7893.812" offset="31678568">And while I say that we make one final observation upon the Government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7899.310" offset="31700616">And the Government's supplemental brief for the first time trying to meet my argument that we have to open only a few plants based upon published material, the Government says it is reliably informed that we'd have to open the big companies in US Steel and Bethlehem.</text>
            <text syncTime="7921.384" offset="31788910">Reliably informed by whom?</text>
            <text syncTime="7926.549" offset="31809599">We're not told.</text>
            <text syncTime="7927.984" offset="31815346">And then from that, the Government proceeds to say that if that were so, which I doubt very much on the basis of the published material, these companies are not the prime companies that make this special type of steel which is custom-made.</text>
            <text syncTime="7947.829" offset="31894653">Then on -- on that basis, the Government says and this I find to be an astonishing statement, as though this is the function of the courts which in my way completely vitiates the notion of the courts are to act judicially.</text>
            <text syncTime="7965.394" offset="31964975">They say if we have to reopen US Steel and Bethlehem, this would be unfair to the small employers in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="7976.468" offset="32009279">What concern is that for the Government in this proceeding?</text>
            <text syncTime="7981.704" offset="32030177">The collective bargaining situation in our dispute with these various companies is our concern and the industry's concern and if there's a public interest, as I know there is, that would be manifested according to a congressional definition of that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="7998.924" offset="32099035">Congress debated at length whether they would prohibit industry strikes, whether they would not, but the concept that the Government asserts that they shouldn't do this, they shouldn't open this plant or that plant because the collective bargaining situation would be impaired, there's not a concept it seems to me properly addressed to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="8048.482" offset="32297253">I would like to begin by saying that the Government accepts the statement by counsel of the chronology of events in this case and comments that it is very frank, open, and skillfully done.</text>
            <text syncTime="8072.465" offset="32393279">This is a matter of great importance to the country, to the union, to management, and of course to our judicial system in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="8090.428" offset="32465063">I should like to clarify the governmental position in regard to the Taft-Hartley Act to start with.</text>
            <text syncTime="8100.044" offset="32503515">It is not the position of the Government that Congress had any intention to open up Norris-LaGuardia, wipe out that statute, and permit injunctions in the same manner as had occurred prior to that time in labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="8123.334" offset="32596720">We think if some of the arguments of the union were valid especially about whether this injunction would contribute to the settlement of the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="8138.736" offset="32658265">If that was the measure, the Congress certainly should have made the statute broad enough to encompass all labor disputes, because that is the objective that we are all looking for in all of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="8154.898" offset="32722944">We think that there has been a gloss imposed upon the area of labor disputes in this country that must be recognized by all parties and by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="8174.594" offset="32801729">The Wagner Act and the Labor Management Act are all part of that, so that you cannot expect or think about returning to a condition prior to Norris-LaGuardia.</text>
            <text syncTime="8191.346" offset="32868707">But the Labor Management Act did have a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="8197.132" offset="32891904">And it was conceived by a Congress that was bedeviled by strike and labor disputes during the year 1946 that were unequalled in the history of this country except for the year 1919 right after the First World War.</text>
            <text syncTime="8224.169" offset="33000051">And we must address ourselves in a consideration of this statute and what its meaning is and what Congress was trying to do for the country, not for management or labor either one of them, but for all the people of this country in this Act, in the light of the situation that existed then.</text>
            <text syncTime="8252.239" offset="33112377">There were more men out of work than any other period during that year in the history of the country up to that date, and more work stoppages.</text>
            <text syncTime="8265.813" offset="33166608">That is not entirely true as to work stoppages when you compare the labor force.</text>
            <text syncTime="8273.110" offset="33195760">If you compare the labor force back in 1919, it was larger proportionately, the work stoppages.</text>
            <text syncTime="8280.120" offset="33223868">But the actual number were larger in 1946 than anytime in the history of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="8287.237" offset="33252289">What happened during 1946? You recall that the end of hostilities was declared in December of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="8297.037" offset="33291473">And the Congress had to consider the effect upon all of the legislation that bore on the question of hostilities and whether or not it was effective with our hostilities continuing.</text>
            <text syncTime="8313.992" offset="33359391">But they had strikes and labor disputes and very difficult ones to look at in determining what action should be -- they should try to take in solving these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="8332.913" offset="33435042">There was a strike in the automobile industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="8336.937" offset="33451133">There was a nationwide steel strike that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="8341.415" offset="33469001">There was a strike of the bituminous coal mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="8346.068" offset="33487600">And the Government seized those coal mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="8350.712" offset="33506200">There was a railroad strike and the Government seized the carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="8356.626" offset="33529919">And then there was a strike after the seizure of the carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="8363.907" offset="33558967">The President addressed the joint session of the Congress asking that he'd be given some emergency legislation to help solve this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="8375.808" offset="33606614">I don't mean any implication that this was his solution because you recall he vetoed this particular act, but he did ask for some affirmative help from the Congress in the form of emergency legislation to help solve this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="8394.314" offset="33680593">Great Lake Shipping was tied up by a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="8398.014" offset="33695431">The unlicensed maritime personnel went on strike and paralyzed shipments in every port in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="8407.422" offset="33733047">And the licensed personnel, as soon as the unlicensed came back to work, the licensed went off and held up shipping.</text>
            <text syncTime="8417.148" offset="33771917">The bituminous coal industry was struck again after the Government took it over.</text>
            <text syncTime="8426.188" offset="33808175">Then you recall the celebrated contempt action involving Mr. John L. Lewis and his union and the large judgment of damages, all of that occurred during this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="8447.227" offset="33892289">And there were great variety of additional strikes during that year, too numerous to name.</text>
            <text syncTime="8456.881" offset="33930846">Now it's against that background that we have to consider what the Congress was trying to do when it passed the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="8468.458" offset="33977240">In the first place it was very careful.</text>
            <text syncTime="8470.651" offset="33986017">No one could read the history, let alone the statute itself, without observing that Congress was using great care not to open up the injunctive procedure generally in regard to labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="8486.703" offset="34050173">It was only in very limited area that they were going to permit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="8494.318" offset="34080684">And you had to find that the strike or lock-out, it applies to both, affected either a substantial part, the two key elements, or the entire industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="8516.122" offset="34167829">And then you have to find that the nation's health and safety is imperilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="8526.889" offset="34210879">Only in those events, not nation's health or safety, only in those events can you get an injunction under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="8538.348" offset="34256750">Now I say that the Congress was using great care as was evidenced throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="8544.178" offset="34280051">The history shows that the bill in the House was not accepted by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="8553.596" offset="34317772">It had a distinction which cuts several ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="8558.189" offset="34336162">Now one of the distinctions was that the bill has finally passed, that was developed in the Senate largely under the direction of Senator Taft, was to encompass a much larger area of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="8574.265" offset="34400423">I think the bill in the House could be said to have been covering very much communications, public utilities and special groups of national industries of that type.</text>
            <text syncTime="8587.791" offset="34454549">But the bill in the Senate was to -- provided that it would include businesses which were engaged in commerce or affected commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="8599.783" offset="34502510">On the light of the history of all that had happened up to 1946 from the 1930 on, it can hardly be assumed that the Congress didn't know when it was changing language that way, that it could not appreciate the difference of the enlargement that it was providing in this change in the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="8623.373" offset="34596864">Now we do not say that in construing Section 208 which is the key section of the statute, that you turn to Section 1 (b), the purpose that Congress recites, and that you try to read from that something into Section 208 that isn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="8650.059" offset="34703653">All we're trying to do, which we think is common and legitimate according to the decisions of this Court, is to look upon the purpose, as we cited there, which this Court has said in a preamble of an act, cannot affect or change the operative sections of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="8673.333" offset="34796753">For some guide, that might help us, if you have difficulty interpreting Section 208 from the language itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="8683.703" offset="34838235">Then we have some difficulty with Section 1 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="8692.889" offset="34874911">It set -- set out at the bottom of page 38 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="8701.349" offset="34908766">And there, the Congress that did carefully reject the words or interest or it says in this provision jeopardize the public health safety or interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="8719.208" offset="34980237">In the final operative sections, the Congress has very carefully -- careful not to accept that terminology of public safety, public health safety or interest as the measure, but it left in, in this section of the same act this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="8742.662" offset="35074069">Now the way we understand that, and the Government, is that the Congress in the operative words was trying to make clear that the national health and safety or safety was what governed, but that as between these two expressions, they did not carry it over into this Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="8771.995" offset="35191306">And if you assume that the Congress was intending to carry it over and this therefore should read the national safety or health.</text>
            <text syncTime="8783.499" offset="35237386">Nevertheless, it does furnish guidance to anyone examining the statute as to what Congress was trying to say in this Act and its passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="8799.483" offset="35301334">And there you will note that the Congress expresses what it thinks about people's rights in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="8811.083" offset="35347728">It is trying to make very plain that it does respect, and it's obvious from the debates that it did, the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="8821.221" offset="35388270">That is a part of the American system.</text>
            <text syncTime="8824.332" offset="35400704">We regard it as a -- an important and precious right of our people.</text>
            <text syncTime="8830.281" offset="35424528">And the right of lock-out is also a right of management that the Congress respected as a part of our free system.</text>
            <text syncTime="8843.899" offset="35478967">But after they recognized that carefully and thoroughly, they then say, “Nobody has a right to do this to the American people if it's going to imperil.”</text>
            <text syncTime="8859.392" offset="35540929">So they say, above all, neither party, that's management and labor or either one, has any right in its relations with any other to engage in acts or practices which jeopardize the public health, safety or interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="8882.065" offset="35631626">Now if they really meant and I don't think that's the proper reading of it in view of what they did about national safety and health, or health in the other part, I think it properly should read as the change they made otherwise as to the national health or safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="8900.502" offset="35705396">But either way you read it, it's a very strong expression by the Congress that no one has a right to jeopardize the people generally, their rights by their acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="8921.588" offset="35789720">Now they don't say all other rights or the general welfare anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="8926.094" offset="35807796">We have to restrict it more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="8928.773" offset="35818454">But they do say the national health or safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="8935.322" offset="35844681">Now it's quite impossible for me on behalf of the Government to understand how national safety can be recognized as the safety of a nation, and then you're going to take that word national and when you apply it to health you mean something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="8956.031" offset="35927542">How Congress could have any such conception and how our reasonable minds can arrive at such a conclusion is very difficult for me to conceive because it's just one phrase, it's the same -- it's tied together right there and if you're going to deal with health, as you would safety as involving the whole nation and its safety, that certainly, it seems to me, would have to do the same with regard to health.</text>

            <text syncTime="9512.858" offset="38154846">Now there's the reliance by the union considerably upon statements of congressmen, then Congressman, Kennedy in the House, now Senator in regard to the kind of strike that he was trying to give refernce and provide for and his statement was, “Some method must be worked out to deal with strikes which crippled the nation's industrial power”, and that is not quoted by counsel but we think that that shows his appreciation of what the Congress was trying to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="9550.640" offset="38305938">He even went farther than this Act and that he thought that the injunction should be permanent in form and so recommended in his minority report.</text>
            <text syncTime="9559.606" offset="38341778">But he did think where they were of national strikes that that's what should be reached and he was trying to reach in this legislation even though he presented the minority report.</text>
            <text syncTime="9573.630" offset="38397889">Now in regard to the evidence in this case, it was tried, as counsel said on affidavits and that is a different form than we often have, but it was by agreement of parties limited to that, and so I don't see how that contributes much, except that it seems to me that the lower courts did comment properly upon that evidence when they said that these people who were giving the evidence on behalf of the Government were charged with important responsibilities in the areas in which they purport to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="9614.812" offset="38562670">And each of them, the Secretary of Commerce, when he was talking about this, had the responsibility not only of dealing with the question of the state of the nation's economy and -- and its business activity and all of those things, but the Department of Commerce has also the defense allocations division and it is a part of its responsibilities to try to find out and determine when the defense requirements of the country are being met and if they are not being met, how that can be done by allocations.</text>
            <text syncTime="9657.874" offset="38734869">Now some of the arguments presented by counsel here, we do not think were properly presented or even developed at all before the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="9668.441" offset="38777187">And this question of abuse of discretion, we do not find at any place as in the manner counsel is now presenting it.</text>

            <text syncTime="9721.973" offset="38991287">But on page 215, in the finding that was requested by counsel for the union, you'll notice that he did not say, did not ask the Court to find that it had discretion to deny the injunction if it found that there were some plants that could be opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="9748.671" offset="39098075">In that course, they took the position that the only way that any plants could be opened would be just to produce defense materials and we met that squarely by showing how impossible and impractical it was to try to do anything like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="9863.510" offset="39557413">My argument all the way through in the District Court and in the Court of Appeals in that regard was that the Court had no jurisdiction to issue injunction at all if they could open few plants for defense purposes only, rather than that the Court had that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="9883.168" offset="39636093">Now this is a change of approach, but I don't think that the conclusion on page 215 and number 2 is any fair request to a court to exercise its discretion to determine that steel plants could opened for defense purposes alone or for defense purposes and civilian purposes too when they tie up as they did.</text>

            <text syncTime="10285.207" offset="41244191">Now that system was working on everyone of the open plants in the country, and the defense allocations administration had known not a single time that there was any indication from the Defense Department upon inquiry daily between the two, that any of the items that the -- the Defense Department needs and threaten the security of this country could be obtained from the plants at all.</text>
