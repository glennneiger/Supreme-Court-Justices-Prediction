            <text syncTime="56.420" offset="329017">This case raises the question of whether the National Labor Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the strike and picketing which has taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.107" offset="375829">Incidentally, the strike and picketing (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="71.316" offset="388681">And this case is here by a petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.455" offset="401220">The set of facts in the case are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.048" offset="407594">Seattle Yellow Cab System is composed of 119 corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.324" offset="424626">118 corporations are engaged into the business of operating taxicabs.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.827" offset="430686">Usually, one corporation operates one cab.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.771" offset="438418">The main corporation which is the respondent here, the Yellow Cab Service Company is engaged in the business (Inaudible) the activities of the Yellow Cab Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.594" offset="469765">It supplies the dispatching, the public relations and advertising, the supervisory, and the bookkeeping services for the other corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.755" offset="514382">And, together, these corporations operate the Yellow Cab Company or the Yellow Cab System in the City of Seattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.077" offset="543640">There are approximately 120 Yellow Cabs operating on the streets of Seattle which are under the auspices of -- operate under the auspices of this system.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.677" offset="586062">At the time of the strike, this system employed approximately 160 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.417" offset="613021">About 10 of these employees were employed as dispatchers by the service corporation and the remaining 150 employees were employed to drive the cabs, and all of these employees were members of taxicab drivers, Local 465.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.608" offset="689821">Back in 1956, the Union and the -- the group of corporations began the collective bargaining contract which provided (Inaudible) working conditions for these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.655" offset="734020">This contract ran for two years in 1958 (Inaudible) been set down in the summer or early fall of 1958 and it (Inaudible) new contract but these negotiations were not successful and they (Inaudible) September 16, 1958, the Union called a strike against the Yellow Cab System and placed pickets at the Yellow Cab garage.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.403" offset="820955">As soon as the strike was called, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service stepped into the picture and summoned the parties to a -- to a meeting at the offices of the service in Seattle, but this meeting was not successful and the strike continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.741" offset="890337">And then a few days later, on September 23rd, 1958, the service corporation filed a complaint in the Superior Court for King County, asking that -- that the strike and picketing be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.708" offset="954180">The theory of this complaint was that the service corporation was willing to sign a contract with the Union covering dispatchers only, but it was alleged that the Union refused to sign this contract (Inaudible) all of the corporations participated in the (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="230.412" offset="1025024">That was as soon as the corporation (Inaudible) willingness to enter into this contract, there's no further dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.303" offset="1040593">(Inaudible) a trial was held in early October for (Inaudible) Superior Court of King County, and then, a trial was given to introduce evidence showing (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="254.027" offset="1119483">They introduced other evidence showing that the cab company has agreements with the interstate railroads which operate into Seattle by the terms of which agreements, Yellow Cabs are used to transfer passengers from the train depot to the steamship dock, that is passengers who are travelling on a so-called “through ticket”.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.350" offset="1204746">We also introduced evidence showing that the cab company had agreements with the airports, with the railroad stations, and with the steamship dock, by which it had the exclusive right to pick up passengers who were arriving at those terminals and that the cab company earned substantial amounts of money from the exercise of these franchise or concession agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.721" offset="1302235">At the conclusion of the trial, the trial court ruled that the service corporation's complaint should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.551" offset="1329612">The trial court held that it had no jurisdiction and which the employer was -- the cab system is engaged in (Inaudible) commerce and it had a complaint against the (Inaudible) As soon as the trial court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, the service corporation filed an original mandamus proceeding in the Supreme Court of Washington asking the Supreme Court to compel the trial court to take jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.735" offset="1418324">And after (Inaudible) submitted, the trial court granted that writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.802" offset="1438595">The trial -- rather, the Supreme Court granted that writ directed to the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.492" offset="1457298">The Supreme Court of Washington held that the Seattle Yellow Cab System was not subject to the jurisdiction of the Labor Board and that the Superior Courts of the State of Washington had jurisdiction to adjudicate the lawfulness of the strike and picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.302" offset="1528560">And then, subsequently, a petition for certiorari was filed here which was granted by this Court in June 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.214" offset="1560221">Now, there is no question but that the National Labor Relations Board would take jurisdiction over the Seattle Yellow Cab System.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.025" offset="1599509">The Board has announced that it will assert its jurisdiction over any taxicab company which (Inaudible) of more than $500,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.867" offset="1634826">And the evidence indicates that this cab company has an annual gross business of almost $1.5 million or three times what the Board would require.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.886" offset="1678921">Now, this proposition was advanced in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.200" offset="1696162">The court was told that the Labor Board was taking jurisdiction over taxicab companies such as this company, citations -- proper citations were made, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.024" offset="1743496">But the court below said that this was irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.543" offset="1757497">The court below stated the test to be whether the Seattle Yellow Cab System was “an integral part of interstate commerce”.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.362" offset="1796786">And then, they looked at the record and they noticed that the Seattle Yellow Cabs do not operate across state lines anywhere, and then they concluded that, in their opinion, the Seattle Yellow Cab System was not an integral part of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.389" offset="1852897">And therefore, the Board had no jurisdiction regardless of what position the Board is taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.394" offset="1880900">This is the conclusion of the court below which we believe to be erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.221" offset="1912247">First of all, we believe that there is evidence in the record, ample evidence, indicating that the cab company is actually engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.205" offset="1944221">And now, I'll discuss that in just a moment, but secondly and more importantly, this -- the test applied by the court below was an erroneous test because the National Labor Relations Board has jurisdiction not only of companies which are actually engaged in commerce but of companies whose activities will affect commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.863" offset="2038784">And the (Inaudible) commerce defined the statute as follows.</text>

            <text syncTime="716.933" offset="2971146">And upon arrival at Seattle, you could walk out of the depot, there'd be a yellow cab there at a certain spot.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.287" offset="2996537">You get into that cab and you take part of your ticket and give it to the cab driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.230" offset="3016286">This is called a transfer coupon.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.060" offset="3027571">But, the cab driver would then drive you to the Canadian Pacific Steamship Dock where you could get on a boat and go to Victoria, British Columbia, all on the same ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.992" offset="3067382">And, these transfer arrangements, we believe, are similar to the transfer arrangements which exist in the City of Chicago and which -- which for some time anyway, had been handled by the Parmelee Company where you transfer from one railroad station to another.</text>

            <text syncTime="1224.490" offset="5001383">He indicated that the cabs here are operated by 118 separate companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.042" offset="5019564">This is the case and, in most instances, these corporations operating these which were set up largely for licensing purposes are owned by a single individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.922" offset="5059062">In a very few instances, one man may own two or three taxicabs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.439" offset="5077138">By and large however, these are separately held by -- by individuals who were formerly members of petitioning union who acquired taxicabs two to three years ago now and became independent self-employed businessmen on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.786" offset="5134503">These men, through their corporations, own Yellow Cab Service, which is the only party here before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.344" offset="5164701">It is the respondent-- the true respondent in interest and provides, as Mr. Donaldson has indicated, purely local dispatching and bookkeeping, and other services for the corporations which own it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.689" offset="5214124">Stock is held in respondent by the partners who formerly owned this cab business but who liquidated it three years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.873" offset="5246830">But their ownership is exercised largely for maintenance of their security and the record makes clear that in the day to day operations of this taxicab business or 118 taxicab businesses in fact, the decisions made are those of the owners of the 118 corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.153" offset="5316002">Now, Mr. Donaldson was in error in suggesting that the service company allocates income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.272" offset="5336482">This is not the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1389.406" offset="5661027">The trial court, however, has -- has indicated based its ruling in part upon the feeling that they were to be treated together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.919" offset="5695091">Now, we would like to make before this Court very -- two points very briefly and the others at somewhat greater length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.639" offset="5717974">The two brief ones are that it is as important as ever to maintain a proper balance between the elements of our federal system and, secondly, that it is clear in the law and in the decisions of this Court that the Congress has not entrusted to Congress, in the National Labor Relations Act, regulation of all aspects of the labor problem, although it certainly, we concede has exercised its constitutional authority to its broadest limits in terms of the various phrases it chooses to use in reaching commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.146" offset="5859976">The Commerce Clause of course is one of the principal sources of the power of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.476" offset="5881292">It serves the very useful function of holding the Nation's (Inaudible) desirable and applaud all of the activities of the federal government to that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.262" offset="5920371">But like many other good ends, uniformity which is one of the goals thus sought, can be carried too far and can reach a point where we feel it poses an actual threat to the (Inaudible) of this relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.424" offset="5973034">(Inaudible) maybe this was a power, is one of the (Inaudible) as to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.430" offset="6105109">But we believe this case presents a situation at the other extreme, a local business, quite within the competence of the local courts and having no impact upon the national interest to justify a federal intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.476" offset="6153279">As for our second point, we have cited at pages 31 and 33 of our brief a number of decisions of this Court which make it crystal clear that Congress has not given to the National Labor Relations Board exclusive jurisdiction in the labor field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.184" offset="6212106">This necessarily means, as these cases also state that much authority is left to the states, although this has to be spelled out on a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.529" offset="6245439">It is our contention that at least three things, however are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.819" offset="6266650">First, that the states, by virtue of the Constitution, have exclusive power over labor disputes not affecting commerce in the constitutional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.392" offset="6300923">Secondly, that by virtue of the act of Congress itself, it has chosen to make only certain labor management conduct subject to the control of the National Labor Relations Board and to this other (Inaudible) nor protected by the federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.535" offset="6361527">And thirdly, that by virtue of the management (Inaudible) should materially its interest, otherwise (Inaudible) exercised in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.105" offset="6479809">(Inaudible) made perfectly clear not only in its grant of power for the Board in Section 10 (a) to prevent -- defined unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.411" offset="6509066">But in its preliminary declarations and findings that what it is concerned with are Labor Relations labor disputes and practices affecting commerce and these are the only matters entrusted to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.778" offset="6554520">This is the clear import of the statutory language and it is also the holding of this course in the Santa Cruz case, the Fainblatt case, the Polish Alliance case, and a number of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.169" offset="6600077">Now, petitioners speak even here, and in their brief of industries affecting commerce and of business (Inaudible)</text>

            <text syncTime="2114.709" offset="8562186">But we suggest in our brief that this again is speculation that if that is why no one was inconvenienced, it should have been proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.689" offset="8590085">Our -- our theory and what we would have proved if this issue was raised was that those people were being serviced by Yellow Cabs, driven by their owners, driven perhaps somewhat longer hours than they had done formerly, but still being driven so that the public was served.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.772" offset="8654451">Now, as to this matter of the admitted interstate commerce, the $1400, the Supreme Court of Washington regarded this as being in interstate commerce but held it de minimis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.076" offset="8699695">As -- as we suggest in the brief, this Court has recognized in the Fainblatt case, that de minimis should be considered in determining the jurisdiction of the Board and we feel that it should be applied here because, otherwise, we find it hard to imagine a case of -- of any significance even locally, which would not involve more money than is involved here, and we have cited the Freiburg case in this connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.169" offset="8800005">We believe the further ground for treating this amount as insufficient to invoke the Board's jurisdiction is contained in the very press release of the Board upon which petitioners rely so heavily, because this states that as to instrumentalities, links, and channels of interstate commerce, the Board will take jurisdiction only if $50,000 a year of gross revenues are realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.180" offset="8892061">Obviously of course, the sum here in question falls far below that and therefore, under 14 (c) as added by the 1959 amendments, the states will be permitted to take jurisdiction of that much interstate commerce because the Board has stated it will not do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.988" offset="12923277">So, the issue then is, what is the proper test for the Board, and I submit that the proper test for the Board or the exercise of the Board's jurisdiction is whether a dispute could reasonably tend to affect commerce and not whether a dispute has actually affected commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.883" offset="12998928">There -- the Board has been administering the National Labor Relations Act for 24 to 25 years now and this question has come up many times before the Board and no -- no Board case has ever held that the test depends upon the actual impairment of Congress.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard P. Donaldson</label>
            <text syncTime="3328.846" offset="13418768">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.148" offset="13419917">The -- the First Circuit there said that the employer's argument had absolutely no merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.022" offset="13439457">Those are the words the court used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.554" offset="13449592">Now, with respect to the facts -- I might say, before going to the facts that of course, that's the reason we didn't put in any evidence on this because it was -- it isn't required as a test of the Board's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.763" offset="13498389">With respect to the facts, I would call the Court's attention to pages 38 and 39 of the printed record because there, you will find a sworn affidavit which was filed in the court below by the president of the service corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.896" offset="13562964">This affidavit was filed on October the 17th when they were attempting to get a writ of mandamus from the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.145" offset="13595982">And, you will read several paragraphs of this -- of this affidavit and realize that the service corporation was pleading that it was being tremendously damaged by this strike and picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.540" offset="13649481">Here is one of the paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.989" offset="13659303">“That none of the employees of any of the 118 independent cab corporations have reported for work resulting in substantially reduced operations, both of the plaintiff-relater and of the said 118 corporations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.460" offset="13721161">Next paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.834" offset="13726699">“That as a result of the foregoing considerable delays on the part of the customers seeking cab service, have resulted to the damage both of the plaintiff-relater, the 118 corporations, and the general public.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.909" offset="13783019">And lastly, it says “The time is of the very essence of this matter since continued picketing may put the plaintiff-relater and all of the cab companies out of existence, thereby, diminishing competition and injuring the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.444" offset="13837145">So, I say, as a matter of fact, that the position assumed by the respondent in this Court is totally inconsistent with the position assumed by it in the court below and in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.734" offset="13882284">Thank you very much.</text>
