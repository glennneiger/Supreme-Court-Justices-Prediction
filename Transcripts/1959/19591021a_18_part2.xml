            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Winston, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert T. Winston, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="14.938" offset="163088">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.633" offset="181896">As stated by Mr. Kramer, there are two questions before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.893" offset="202898">The first question involves the controversy between the trustees and Benedict and the second question involves the controversy between Benedict and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.169" offset="248038">As noted, if we are in error on the second question, we are wrong, then the first question would become moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.983" offset="279280">But we think our position is sound in this case so we don't think that the first question will become moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.698" offset="302164">But in neither event, I agree with Mr. Kramer that it is a question of importance and that this Court should determine it.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.721" offset="338213">The first question involves the trustees' claim against Benedict for royalties that the trustees claim are due and owing and for royalties which the trustees claim they had a vested right to.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.996" offset="403310">Before discussing that, we come back to the initial contract, that is the contract of 1950 between Benedict and other operators and the union, the National Coal Contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.950" offset="459212">This contract is an integrated contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.134" offset="471960">Its provisions are interdependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.342" offset="484707">A portion of the contract provides for this trust fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.836" offset="502680">This contract in that portion also sets out Benedict's obligations of payment to the trustees and sets out the method of computation when the obligation accrues and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.732" offset="562343">This contract also contains the settlement of Local Dispute Section, which the Court has considered in the first argument and it is a section that sets out the various steps for the settling of these local disputes and troubles.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.262" offset="628381">The key part of this first contract, for our consideration, is Section 3 of the Miscellaneous Clause, which is already been pointed out to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.885" offset="694941">The pertinent part of -- of this clause, rather this clause itself reads as follows, Section 3, “The contracting parties agree that, as a part of the consideration of this contract, any and all disputes, stoppages, suspensions of work and any and all claims, demands or actions growing therefrom or involved therein, shall, by the contracting parties, be settled and determined exclusively by the machinery provided in the settlement of "Local and District Disputes Section of this Agreement, or, if national in character, by the full use of free collective bargaining as heretofore known and practiced in industry.”</text>
            <text syncTime="190.102" offset="863796">This contract also hung as a clause which we think is the key to the whole issue and that is the interdependent clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.346" offset="896711">It reads as follows, “This Agreement is an integrated instrument and its respective provisions are interdependent and shall be effective --</text>

            <text syncTime="212.360" offset="952822">I was reading from page 2 of my brief, sir, in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.727" offset="974242">It would be page 107A, page 2 of my brief, page 107A of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.115" offset="1035786">Now, our position in this case is simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.727" offset="1050311">Well, it is that the trust is the creature of this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.257" offset="1068387">The trustees' rights are derivative from this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.867" offset="1086882">Whatever you may call the trustees or whatever position they may claim that they are occupying in this lawsuit, they are still in the position of beneficiaries of this contract when we consider their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.110" offset="1151770">Since they are the beneficiaries of this contract, they would then be subject to the same defenses and in regards to their claims for royalties that Benedict might assert against the other contracting party, the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.845" offset="1218748">This defense would include offset or failure of consideration or non-performance which we are concerned with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.257" offset="1252394">Now, in the case at bar, the union breached the very provision, that is Section 3 of the Miscellaneous Clause, that was stated to be a part of the consideration of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.722" offset="1318222">Now, the trustees, on the other hand, insist that they are merely trustees seeking to recall a trust property, title to which has vested in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.425" offset="1373080">And that brings up the other key question and that is has title to this money sought vested so as to preclude the defenses that Benedict might assert against the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.632" offset="1441938">We state that as to this $76,000, title has not vested.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.596" offset="1465762">Our reasons are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.965" offset="1483212">In the first place, the money before title can vest in -- in the trustees must be due and owing.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.018" offset="1523440">Now, to be due and owing, the union, at the time that it is alleged to be due and owing, what the law at the time of the production of the coal upon which the amount is computed, must be in performance of its interdependent obligations to bid in this case, the union was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.728" offset="1614242">In the first strike activity that was a violation of the contract started in the early part of April 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.612" offset="1649768">To be due and owing, the amount computed from the production of coal must also be free from claims or rights of settle.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.063" offset="1695640">In this case, it was not.</text>

            <text syncTime="417.767" offset="1774425">Therefore, our position is the key is whether at the time the money is due and owing.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.199" offset="1800129">We say at the time it is not due and owing or the right of the trustees to assert that it is due and owing is limited because at that time, the union was not in compliance with an interdependent obligation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1341.984" offset="5471274">We think that term is the key to the case and merely means that all of the terms and all of the obligations are interdependent and the obligation, of course, of Benedict to have money due and owing the trustees is dependent upon the union being in compliance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3162.159" offset="12752018">In other words, when you cancel an abrogate, previous no-strike clause, Mr. Boiarsky says you could have not have express the right to strike in more -- in more definite language.</text>

            <text syncTime="3187.291" offset="12852537">If that has been what they meant and if that had been what they wanted, they could have used more definitive language to retain the right to strike for dispute-settling purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3247.883" offset="13094954">Now, Mr. Boiarsky stated that the purpose of the union in 1947 and of course in 1950 was to avoid the impact of damage actions brought under 301, when that cancellation followed the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.479" offset="13161305">Well, at the same time, Clause 3 was put, which said, “You will settle disputes exclusively by the said machinery.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.858" offset="13206758">In considering the purpose of the contracting parties, you should consider not only the purpose of the union when they want to get out of -- avoid damage actions, but we must also consider the purpose of the operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.839" offset="13266735">It is certain that the operators, when they put in Clause 3, but wanting some clause that would give them a continuity of operation pending this little local matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.527" offset="13321488">And Mr. Boiarsky also cited the Lion Oil Company case versus -- NLRB versus the Lion Oil Company case to the effect that where there has been no expressed waiver of the right to strike, the waiver of the right doing such a period is not to be inferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.266" offset="13396407">This case is good as far as it goes, but it does not fit this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.158" offset="13420022">In the Lion case, we had a dispute over the modification of the very terms of the contract -- correction, we had a strike over the modification of the very terms of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.108" offset="13475819">And as the Court stated on page 340 of one Lawyers' Edition 2d, here, the strike occurred at a time when the parties were bargaining over modifications after notice and in accordance with the terms of the contract where there has been no expressed waiver of the right to strike, a waiver of the right doing such a period is not to be inferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.727" offset="13582294">We do not believe that the two-phased provision for determine -- for terminating this contract means that it was not within the contemplation of the parties that economic weapons might be used to support demands for modification before the notice to terminate was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.370" offset="13648854">Now, that is a key distinction, as I see it, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.132" offset="13663901">We do not say there is no right to strike during the negotiating process for the contract itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.424" offset="13697024">And that's what the Lion case covers, the negotiating process for the modification of the contract itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.720" offset="13730252">And the Court was careful to use that a waiver of the right doing such a period is not to be inferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.365" offset="13756792">That is doing the negotiation period for a modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.689" offset="13774137">We say that during the process of bargaining for a collective contract, labor should not give up his right to strike because it -- it is its best economic weapon.</text>
