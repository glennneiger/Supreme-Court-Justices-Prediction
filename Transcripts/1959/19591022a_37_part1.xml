            <label>Mr. Harold H. Greene</label>
            <text syncTime="13.393" offset="156923">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.396" offset="164968">Although the government is respondent in this case, under stipulation that was approved by the Court, we will argue first.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.342" offset="200704">This case arises out of denial by the District Court for the District of Colorado of a habeas corpus petition filed by this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.645" offset="237902">This Court granted certiorari prior to the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.769" offset="262457">In 1956, this petitioner was working in Berlin as a civilian employee, as an auditor for the Comptroller Division of the Berlin Command.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.478" offset="305298">He was then living in American Government's quarters built with occupational funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.849" offset="334764">On June 22nd, 1956, he was arrested and served with three charges for the total of seven specifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.571" offset="369664">First charge of two specifications of indecent act with children under 16 years of age, the second charge is three specifications of sodomy, and the third charge had two specifications of display of obscene pictures to children under the age of 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.918" offset="435075">He was tried on these charges and at the trial, he objected to the jurisdiction of the Court on the ground that he was a civilian and therefore not amenable to the court-martial jurisdiction and his objection was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.261" offset="488364">He pleaded guilty and was found guilty accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.062" offset="499649">He was given a sentence of 10 years imprisonment which was subsequently reduced to five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.161" offset="523995">The judgment and the sentence were approved by the convening authority by the Board of Review and by the Court of Military Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.102" offset="563806">Now while the petitioner was serving a sentence at Fitzsimons Army Hospital near Denver, he brought this habeas corpus action and the District Court denied the petition on the ground that Article 2 (11) was constitutional as applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.028" offset="631515">This case is largely like the first case, the Guagliardo case that was argued by Mr. Davis, first in the series since this petitioner like Guagliardo was a civilian employee accused of a noncapital offense, but in this case, and we -- of course we rely on all the arguments made in that connection, but here, the jurisdiction of the court-martial can be sustained and yet the different and alternative ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.205" offset="740185">And that is that the court-martial, the trial, constituted an exercise of the war powers of the Congress as expressed in Article 18 of the Uniform Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.335" offset="784697">That article provides in substance that a general court-martial should have jurisdiction to try any person who by the law of war is subject to trial by military tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.444" offset="833181">As Madsen against Kinsella shows under the law of war any person living in territory occupied by the United States, including American civilians is triable by a military court.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.195" offset="896188">Now petitioner in this case concedes and -- one that Berlin is presently under military occupation for all purposes and secondly of military trials may validly be held in that type of territory, and the question that he raises is that this petitioner was not tried on the theory that he was subject to the war powers, but he was tried on the theory that he was a person employed by in the armed forces under Article 2 (11) and that therefore the Government cannot, said, change it to jurisdictional theory at this point in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.747" offset="1042369">You might say it was raised previously before the Court of Military Appeals and before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.536" offset="1073507">Now it must be clearly understood that there is no dispute here about jurisdiction in the sense of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.718" offset="1098271">The petitioner as I understand the concession agrees that the court-martial had power to try him under Article 18 that is under the will powers of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.119" offset="1143829">The only question is whether procedurally, that power was exercised in this case by the drawing of the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.084" offset="1187715">Now initially, since the -- since power has deemed to exist and has been conceded to exist, it's our position that this is not really a matter for the civil courts of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.857" offset="1230764">The civil courts will review military judgments only to determine whether they were totally void for one of power not whether procedural irregularities might have existed in the cause of the -- in the cause of the exercises of the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.394" offset="1292936">Procedural questions are for the military courts and for military law.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.503" offset="1309341">And the fact that the proposition that only procedural questions and military questions are involved, I think it's shown by the fact that petitioner in his brief relies wholly on military law and military decisions to show that the exercise power he was --</text>

            <text syncTime="740.940" offset="3067173">Now, I might say too that the military law has been authoritatively stated by the case of United States against Schultz in which the Court of Military Appeals was confronted with precisely this same situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="768.634" offset="3177932">It was -- the Court held, the Court of Military Appeals held that this jurisdiction could not be sustained under Article 2 (11) because he was not in fact employed by the armed forces.</text>

            <text syncTime="1345.343" offset="5484753">Now, the subsidiary point that's being made in connection with the Article 18 argument with the argument that he was being tried here under the law of war is that to try him in that fashion was denial of due process in that, not all persons in Berlin are presently being tried by military courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.020" offset="5583496">The only persons admittedly who are being tried by military courts -- well, are persons who are actually in uniform and persons who are connected with the armed forces as employees or dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.771" offset="5646503">And the Allied Kommandatura Law number seven which is here involved, this is a third category of persons who might commit offenses against the allies or against the military authorities there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.293" offset="5700524">So it is said that this is an unlawful, unjust discrimination to single out this category of service connected civilians of civilians, of employees and dependents who are there with there with the American armed forces single them out for a trial under this war power under Article 18 and not to try all of the civilian population of West Berlin, including American tourists and any other persons who might come there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.181" offset="5828106">It seems to us that even if the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as read into the Due Process Clause, if it could be applied in that type of situation as broadly as it would here and I think the Quirin case and the Yamashita case goes undoubtedly in that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.989" offset="5927372">Even in that event, a case of unlawful discrimination has not been made out historically and throughout the ages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.146" offset="5971989">Persons who were actually with the occupying force either as soldiers or persons employed by the occupying force have been exempt from local criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the occupied country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1488.032" offset="6055476">This has been the practice throughout the ages and therefore this type of discrimination, this kind of distinction that's being made with the persons connected with the occupation who were tried in the courts of the occupying power and other persons who were not connected with the occupation who were being tried in the local courts seems to us is -- cannot be construed as unlawful discrimination in violation of due process even -- given that concept the very broader scope that could be imagined.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.481" offset="6245334">The petitioner has no desire whatever to involve Your Honors in the Berlin crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.182" offset="6280129">I think that we're bound by the determination of the political department that Berlin is occupied territory and I don't question for a minute that military courts can function in occupied territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.801" offset="6342614">In Madsen versus Kinsella teaches that the President acts by virtue of his position as Commander-in-Chief and even acts through military agencies or civilian agencies as he deems best.</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.828" offset="6398725">Our position is that this wasn't a military government trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.419" offset="6417011">This -- when we gave up the occupation in West Germany, we gave up the incidence of occupation in Berlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.269" offset="6464449">There are no occupation courts functioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.448" offset="6477197">They have never functioned since May 5, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.397" offset="6496946">The only civilians who have been tried have been the accompanying 2 (11) civilians and they have been tried under 2 (11).</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.674" offset="6534040">Now, what have we here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.442" offset="6541145">We have here a collateral attack on the jurisdiction of the tribunal of limited jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.330" offset="6572701">The jurisdiction of that tribunal must appear on the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.760" offset="6602376">It is not necessary to prove all of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.881" offset="6618885">Let us say we have the normal court-martial Gusik against Schilder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.505" offset="6645426">If on court-martial Gusik says that he isn't soldier, you say I am private company A of the 29th Infantry, you haven't proved I am.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.003" offset="6687431">You didn't prove it in the court-martial record then on collateral attack you can show his enlistment papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.302" offset="6712613">In other words, you can establish on collateral attack the truth of the necessary jurisdictional allegations in the challenged proceedings, but what you can't do is to change the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.780" offset="6766529">In Givens v. Zerbst in the 255 United States it was very plainly said, “Nothing being done here changes the record.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.585" offset="6801742">Now, what the Government is attempting to do here is to sustain the jurisdiction over this petitioner on a ground that was not set forth in the proceedings and on the ground that wasn't taken by the Court of Military Appeals which represents the ultimate views of the military judicial system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1948.856" offset="7898781">In other words, there are three headings of possible jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.225" offset="7912260">One violation of the common law of war shooting prisoners, sniping at the troops, any interference with the occupation, second violation of the municipal law, murder, any of the more conventional offenses, and third, violation of the occupying commander's orders, curfew for instance, that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.479" offset="7993240">But when you particularized it by saying that this is a violation of an article of a code which in terms makes punishable only conduct by persons subject to the code, you have what this started out to be and what it finished out pass in the military system a prosecution under the Uniform Code for someone under 2 (11) and that brings us to 2 (11).</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.157" offset="8091982">Now, I want to take up as I've indicated in the previous argument the Government said in 1957 there is no difference between civilian employees and civilian dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.903" offset="8151019">It's a question of state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2020.827" offset="8186650">And I would like to go into that much of views field of history and I propose to cover all of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2042.422" offset="8273063">There can be no dispute, but the sampling technique is not adapted to historical generalizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.347" offset="8300753">And I will try to touch all the points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.139" offset="8311933">Now I think and that, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, is what makes this so long.</text>

            <text syncTime="2062.735" offset="8354356">But there is no consistent practice in what was subjectively regarded as time of piece of trying accompanying civilians, but apart from a number of essentially episodic instances many of which were flagrantly and palpably illegal on their face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.494" offset="8453308">Now in the continental army, yes, civilian employees were tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.005" offset="8475355">Well, there is a classic example of -- in time of war in the field then there were other civilians tried by the army for what appeared to be war offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.615" offset="8541811">The Government cited one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.533" offset="8553514">I found about 34 additional and also found that as Washington's writing shows these people were not tried on the articles of war but on the results of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.613" offset="8593847">And then the Government says, “Well those are all irrelevant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.094" offset="8607744">Well, considering that they started with the first one, I think that's a little unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.271" offset="8624462">As a matter of fact, that's unkind because here, I did their homework for them but at any rate, this was a war time jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.381" offset="8660929">It was not time of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.979" offset="8667303">Now, do we have any expressions, contemporaneous expressions of what the policy and the thinking was around that time?</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.077" offset="8703666">And the answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.285" offset="8708472">In 1765, the British parliament passed an act and this was the infamous parliament that passed the Stamp Act, they passed the Mutiny Act for North America in which they said that anybody found in this vast western wilderness which was just been conquered from the French who commits offenses shall be apprehended by the officer commanding his majesty's troops and forthwith taken into the nearest settled province or colony there to be dealt with according to the law of that colony as though his offense have been committed there and the only right the misgrant laws was the right of venue in a place where there weren't many people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.928" offset="8859042">All right, 1787, the 11 of July, two proposals come before the continental Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.388" offset="8888926">One is the first draft of the northwest ordinance and the second is the report by the secretary at war, General Knox saying, “There are a lot of people here in the Northwest Territory who were committing depredations against Indians and that starts Indian wars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.465" offset="8949217">I suggest that we try and punish these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.897" offset="8963009">I have the military officer, the commander of the troops try and punish these people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.384" offset="8984952">Two days later, the northwest ordinance was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.835" offset="8994670">The Knox report went to a Committee and the Committee said, “Well, let us have these offenders against the Indians tried by court-martials subject to the law of martial as though they were enlisted soldiers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.249" offset="9044407">Well, that was passed to another committee and the other committee came back and said, well, ordinarily, yes, civil offenses should be dealt with by the civil magistrate but until a civil government is established and crimes are punished by anybody who injures the Indians should be tried by court-martial as though he were an enlisted soldier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.181" offset="9132074">And that rested in the file and no action was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.529" offset="9145448">In other words, even though there was to be a hiatus of 14 months because the first governor didn't take over for a year and no crimes act was passed in the Northwest Territory for another two months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.396" offset="9196962">In preference to military jurisdiction over civilians, Congress preferred a hiatus of law and order.</text>

            <text syncTime="2297.845" offset="9294764">It was a generalized military jurisdiction, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.187" offset="9308139">Now, Mr. Davis said yesterday, there is no affirmative statement in the debates and in the ratifying conventions to the effect that land and naval forces doesn't include military trials of the accompanying civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.657" offset="9378043">Well, I think the notion that land and naval forces meant trying civilians in time of peace was just too fantastic to have occurred to anyone as little bit like they all saw the boy who complains to his mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.396" offset="9436975">“But mommy, you didn't tell me I shouldn't put beans in my ears.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.116" offset="9451813">Nobody could think of anything so fantastic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.221" offset="9464247">And if they had looked in number 83 of the federal list, Hamilton said trial by jury remains unimpaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.255" offset="9496430">Well, that brings us to the 1790s and I found in the manuscripts in my Appendix D a number of trials of civilians under the aegis of General Wayne and General Wilkins, most of them under General Wayne.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.428" offset="9565080">Well, now of course, the 1790s and terms of our concepts were a time of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.609" offset="9593814">In terms of the concepts of the mid 19th Century, they were a time of peace except where the Indians were actually being shot at out in the Northwest Territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.270" offset="9644492">But then in studying the military cases in the 1790s, I came across something that puzzled me because under AW 2 of 1786, any death sentence in time of piece had to be referred to Congress until 1796.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.896" offset="9710947">And yet, in these records manuscript and otherwise, I find that General Wayne ordered death sentences into execution in the 1790s before the transfer of power came.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.873" offset="9762879">And I thought, how can he do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.673" offset="9770088">Was he disregarding the articles of war?</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.115" offset="9783881">When they reported it to Knox, the Secretary of War incidentally, well, I'll come to that later and Knox was a man who went strictly according to the book in military matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.717" offset="9834245">And then I went through the statutes at large and the journals of the continental Congress and the state paper, is there anything that transferred the power from the Congress to the commanding general to execute these death sentences in the field?</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.636" offset="9889938">And I didn't find anything and the only way that those executions would have been legal would have been in time of war and then the light dawned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.714" offset="9922226">They thought it was a time of war and Secretary of War Pickering who succeeded Knox said in 1795, since the commencement of the Indian war, the United States have been in a situation that excluded the idea of its being a time of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.877" offset="10002892">In other words, putting ourselves into the minds of the people of the 1790s, they thought -- they thought it was a time of war.</text>

            <text syncTime="2500.188" offset="10104142">And you get the sort of lawlessness that Wilkinson perpetrated at Detroit where a man committed an offense that was denounced by an act of Congress and Wilkinson issued an order against him and he was just a citizen unconnected with the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.049" offset="10167568">And he tried him by court-martial and had him lashed with a wired cat of nine tails.</text>

            <text syncTime="2531.121" offset="10227858">And this, at a time, at a time when Washington was enjoining on the military, their narrow functions, and the Government says, “Oh well, but Wayne was the superior military authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.123" offset="10287835">He was the highest officer there was.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.267" offset="10296404">Yes, he was the highest military officer but there was a Secretary of War and there was the President and what Wayne did in many of these instances was just palpably illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.431" offset="10345096">Many times, where the civil courts were functioning, certainly nothing -- certainly nothing from which you can derive the threat that the Government seeks to find that it's alright when the civil courts aren't functioning.</text>
