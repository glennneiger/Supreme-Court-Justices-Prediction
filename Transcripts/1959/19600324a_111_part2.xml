            <text syncTime="11.479" offset="149295">In the petitioner's reply brief, it is stated at page 9 and 10 that the Government has grossly misstated the procedural settings in which the question of improper joinder arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.911" offset="223065">This is enlarged upon on the following page.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.226" offset="236231">I assume that an accusation for that kind is not likely made and rather, the point is, itself, in part and I think it has to be responded to, if only to give the Court the citations in the records which we rely upon in making the statement which we made.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.956" offset="323166">The Court will have to look at the record to know whether the Government has grossly misstated the procedural setting, so -- and I don't think that it is good use of time to do so during the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.797" offset="370604">If I may, I will give the page references in the printed records, which sustain the position, which we've taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.686" offset="406131">Page 11 (a), page 19 (a), page 21 (a).</text>

            <text syncTime="85.192" offset="444165">Whether them -- that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.640" offset="453883">I -- I think it is not important to argue the point on its merits because I can see that the Court has the power to do justice and see that the fair trial has given whether a motion is made or not, but when the statement like this is made in -- in the counsel's brief, I assume that it's -- it should be replied to.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.330" offset="556701">There was, by the way, a motion for new trial made after the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.131" offset="571852">They renewed their -- at that time, they renewed their motion for judgment and made a motion for new trial, but there was no motion before the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.098" offset="611767">Now, in a case such as this, the theories of law in the pleadings and precedents, I think, I'm pretty useless unless they are applied to the facts of the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.702" offset="662131">I think it is futile to argue about improper joinder without reference to the nature of the transactions, which are here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.340" offset="704763">But basically, the question is whether or not, these petitioners received a fair trial when they were tried together in spite of the fact that the conspiracy count was found not to be sufficiently supported to go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.390" offset="792952">I think the best starting point in this case is to look at the indictments which are reprinted at page 5 (a), which is repeated to 5 (a) to 7 (a) of the -- of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.691" offset="842167">The indictments are simple indictment in four counts, the first three of these counts charge the substantive effect of transporting and causing to the be transported in -- in interstate commerce, goods -- stolen goods to a value in excess of $5,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.940" offset="923146">And those charged in the first count are the three Stracuzzas, Anthony, Mario and Dorothy together with the petitioner -- one of the petitioner -- two of the petitioners here, Max and Norman Schaffer, who maintained a clothing store in Lebanon, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.906" offset="999006">The second count is identical with the first, except that the owner of the store who received the goods was Benjamin Marco and the third count, again is identical with the first two, except that the Hyman Karp is the store owner who had received the stolen goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.430" offset="1085106">The fourth count was the conspiracy count which tied all of them together as a -- as a general conspiracy and as to which the Court found that there was not sufficient evidence to go the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.202" offset="1136201">On page 8 (a) is a second indictment, which also charges conspiracy, this time a conspiracy to steal goods from interstate commerce and -- but there is only a conspiracy charge here and this indictment was dismissed at the same time that the count on conspiracy in the first indictment was dismissed and it really raises no different questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.869" offset="1238810">Now, the evidence in this case shows that the Stracuzzas were engaged in buying stolen property from truck drivers in New York City and they were selling this property from a establishment they maintained in New York City to the owners of clothing stores, operated by the two Schaffers in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, by Mr. Karp in Fall River, Massachusetts and by Mr. Marco in Bluefield, West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.981" offset="1375274">The evidence showed that these purchases must have known that the merchandise they received was stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.537" offset="1417488">They contracted to buy it at a predetermined percentage of its wholesale price either 55% or 60% or 65% as the case may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.802" offset="1458552">The Stracuzzas reshipped to these buyers in interstate commerce, in lots, each one of which was less than $5,000 in value.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.466" offset="1509230">However, during the period of two and a half months, which is covered by this indictment, each purchaser purchased more than $5,000 dollars worth of -- of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.919" offset="1563042">And this is specifically stipulated by each one of the defendants at the trial, example form of the stipulation appearing on page 21 (a) of the record, where it is specifically stated that the aggregate value of the property shipped to the Schaffers was in excess of $5,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.692" offset="1650186">Actually, the record shows that the Schaffers received something like $19,000 of property, that Mr. Karp received $17,000, and that Mr. Marco received about $23,000 worth of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.387" offset="1728972">I think that the order of the presentation of proof is significant in this case, in order to determine whether or not a severance should've been ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.252" offset="1772335">The nature of the proof was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.379" offset="1780903">First, Anthony Stracuzza, who had pleaded guilty, testified for the Government and he described the overall nature of the entire transaction showing that the goods were stolen and received by him and his brother and was sold to these individual store owners, with no attempt being made to -- to hide the -- the source of the -- of the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.148" offset="1903992">His testimony and cross-examination, covered about a week of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.770" offset="1938474">Since he was an accomplice, he was more than an accomplice, he was really the heart of the whole transaction and was far from a trustworthy person, the Government felt that it was necessary to substantiate his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.421" offset="1985076">And it proceeded to do so with evidence from FBI agents who had kept his place under surveillance and who had also checked the receipt of the goods in the various stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.559" offset="2029589">And was also substantiated by evidence from the transporting agencies who testified as to the property being stolen from them, however, the evidence as introduced, showed little or no relationships between the individual petitioners who are here and on that basis, the judge -- the trial judge determined at the end of the Government's case, that the Government had not made out an overall conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.009" offset="2163440">And he took that account away from -- from the -- from the jury and submitted the remainder of the case to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.607" offset="2205759">At that time, there was a discussion as to whether or not, it was possible for the jury to distinguish the evidence between the individual dependents and the judge was very clear in his statements that he saw no difficulty in it and that he would cover up with instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.240" offset="2288306">Now, our first problem is the application of the rule, as to joinder, to this set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.163" offset="2324041">Now, the rule -- our present rule is 8 (b) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, set forth at page 3 of the Government's brief and we are concerned with joinder of defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.505" offset="2405439">Now, this rule permits the joinder of defendants charged to have participated in the same act or transaction, or in the same series of acts or transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.072" offset="2483702">The rule was adopted, as this Court well knows pursuant to the advice by this Court -- pursuant to the advice of an advisory committee, who in then note state that the purpose of this rule was to adopt the more lenient position on joinder of defendants, which had been followed by the Fifth and the Second Circuit as distinguished from a limited rule as the joinder of defendants, which had received recognition in some other circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.109" offset="2619852">And it was in that light as a -- as a purposeful adopting of a more lenient rule that the -- the rule was submitted to this Court and adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.654" offset="2673977">At the same time, of course, Rule 14 was adopted and Rule 14 is the rule which protects the defendants from any possible prejudice from the relaxation with respect to the rule of joinder.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.388" offset="2732910">Rule 14 provides that if the defendant or the Government is prejudiced by a joinder of offences, then the trial court shall take appropriate action, either through severance or otherwise, to protect the -- to protect the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.781" offset="2802500">Now, the question is an application of this general rule to this factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.341" offset="2828727">Is this is a series of transactions which can properly be joined in a single indictment?</text>
            <text syncTime="690.729" offset="2866239">And basically, I think the way it should be approached -- I think it falls within the language of the rule and I think that the approach that should be taken to it is -- can -- is this the kind of a case -- is this the kind of a trial where the individual defendants can be given a fair trial, when they are tried together or is the nature of case such, that it must be separate and have separate trials?</text>
            <text syncTime="718.335" offset="2976684">There are really four cases in this Court that -- that deal specifically with this type of problem and they go to one land to the other and the fact of the matter is that, they can be distinguished on -- on their facts, whether or not, as the Court would look at them, it is possible for -- or not whether it's possible, but whether there is prejudice to the -- to the defendants, whether it appears that prejudice would occur, if they were tried together.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.781" offset="3106461">The Kotteakos case, which is one of the most recent cases, is a case where it was felt that they should not have been tried together, because in that case, there were 32 persons which would -- who were charged with conspiracy, involved eight separate groups of transactions and the Court felt that in that -- in that setting, it was impossible for a jury to separate the -- separate the matter out.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.848" offset="3210742">I have -- I think that if the Court will look at this record and -- and notice that the kind of testimony that was introduced, the nature of the proof, that it will become apparent that there isn't any fuzz in this, as to -- as to which defendant the proof applies to.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.597" offset="3293811">The -- the proof is -- the proof that Stracuzza gave in the first place, dealt with the first pile of that transaction upon -- in the -- in the beginning, that is the nature where the goods came from, it obviously applies to all of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.036" offset="3363506">And then he dealt with his dealings with each one in turn.</text>

            <text syncTime="3053.088" offset="12315773">That's -- that's all that was to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.041" offset="12323506">Now, the next point which, I think, is most important is this and that comes to 19 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.347" offset="12384737">The Court said, “What I am going to do puts you in the most unique position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.139" offset="12399888">I am going to assume you raising for a motion to dismiss so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.940" offset="12415143">And you know from reading the cases, that you put your case in at your peril, because it might develop to your disadvantage.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.422" offset="12441057">Well, it's not correct for the Government to represent to this Court that that referred to the fact that if a man had taken the stand, they might have asked him a question on cross-examination, was the shipment more that $5,000, because they knew, no shipment was $5,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.047" offset="12503542">They were added up, so that the -- that problem didn't come into play at all when the judge said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.495" offset="12533321">The -- the defendant -- they had the record of the shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.879" offset="12546905">So that came in context and you'll have to read, I am sorry, I didn't print by new -- it didn't -- it wouldn't develop this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.620" offset="12589850">Between 1429 -- between 1430 and 1434 of the transcript, you'll see that the defendants, one that there were -- had subpoenaed Stracuzza's wife and there was a question whether they -- she should or could not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.030" offset="12675532">They had witnesses, the -- the wives of these individuals and they thought, trusting from memory, that the case might take another week in order to put their defense on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.154" offset="12724015">Now, they decided not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.987" offset="12735300">I can't represent to Your Honor the reason why they cited because I can only talk from the record, but certainly when the Court says that you put -- they -- the Government can't represent that that expression had to deal with the -- that there was the transportation because that was out of the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.420" offset="12801024">No one could say on cross-examination that any shipment was more than $5,000, because if they could, the Government won't approve that on direct examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.411" offset="12836968">They had the record of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.125" offset="12843865">So to leave that impression --</text>

            <text syncTime="3190.383" offset="12864867">Well, we -- we make that point in this -- in the sense that at leading -- leading that in the year for the Court to say that, does affect the disposition of a -- of a joint trial, but I cannot say, I cannot positively represent that as a result of what that took -- what he said, that they did not put on their defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.037" offset="12975522">But it seems to me that in expression like that, most logically, would.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.658" offset="12997987">At any rate, I only -- I never mentioned this on direct examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.873" offset="13014915">I only mentioned it now, in order to remove the impression that the Government wanted -- that the reason we didn't put on was on account of the $5,000 that might've come out in cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.623" offset="13061831">Now, all we've always asked is for a separate trial and that a charge that there be an aggregation of $5,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.299" offset="13088580">That's what we ask in the lower court, that's what ask in the Court of Appeals and that what we ask here.</text>
