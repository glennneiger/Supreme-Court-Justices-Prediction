            <label>Mr. Howard A. Heffron</label>
            <text syncTime="16.960" offset="171238">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.683" offset="186075">This case and the two following cases raise common problems of construction under the Internal Revenue Codes of 1939 and 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.965" offset="235186">The questions relate to the proper computation of the deduction allowed for depreciation in computation of the income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.049" offset="275519">This case, Evans, comes to this Court upon the Government's petition for certiorari to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.318" offset="308642">The case which follows it, the Hertz case comes to this Court from the Third Circuit and the case which follows Hertz, the Massey Motor case from here from the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.499" offset="353364">Both the Third Circuit and the Fifth Circuit reached results contrary to that of the Ninth Circuit in the Evans case; that is in support of the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.196" offset="400175">The question which is common to all three cases is one which concerns the proper method of computation of the depreciation deduction permitted under the pertinent provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.359" offset="464854">Now, since the depreciation is no more than in means of describing the proportionate proportion of the cost of an asset which ought to be allowed as a deduction in computing income for any given period.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.858" offset="546774">We are here concerned with the proper method of allocating that cost to different taxable periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.089" offset="583764">If the asset only lasted for the one year period which is covered by an income tax return, we would have no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.453" offset="617200">The cost of that asset would be deducted in full if it were consumed during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.804" offset="638621">The problem arises because of the nature of the tangible assets which are the subject of these three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.839" offset="670699">Automobiles, automobiles last more than the one year period covered by an income tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.067" offset="703613">On the other hand, they do not last forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.460" offset="713226">At some period, they are discarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.594" offset="721795">They are retired from service and the problem presented by these three cases is how to determine what proportion of the cost of an asset which lasts more than the period covered by the income tax return, what proportion of that cost shall be allocated to the income tax year covered by any particular return?</text>
            <text syncTime="179.449" offset="821164">I say the problem arises because the asset itself lasts beyond the period covered by the return.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="186.514" offset="849377">Is the rule that you're advocating here is limited to automobiles or is it one of general application?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="howard_a_heffron" startTime="192.030" stopTime="515.390">
            <label>Mr. Howard A. Heffron</label>
            <text syncTime="192.030" offset="871528">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.306" offset="872573">It would be a rule of general application.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.946" offset="879156">I cited automobile simply as an example of a tangible asset whose -- which lasts beyond the one year tax period normally covered by an income tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.939" offset="923146">It could apply to heavy machinery, could apply to any type of asset used in industry or business, which would last beyond the period covered by the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.238" offset="968286">Now, if I can absolutely dispute at the outset in this fashion, I would say that the basic position for which the Government contends here is simply this that in determining the cost of the asset which ought to be allocated to the income tax period covered by the return, one ought to take into account as a relevant material in the persuasive factor, the total period of time the taxpayer expects to use the asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.239" offset="1104332">Having made that computation, one must take into account that portion of the assets' value which the taxpayer will get back when he disposes of the asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.696" offset="1142157">If he sells the asset, that portion which he receives upon sale proceeds represents a return of his original outlay in acquiring the asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.000" offset="1187401">To that extent, he has not incurred a cost in using the asset and therefore we must exclude the proceeds he receives as a factor in computing what his cost has actually been.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.453" offset="1233168">The taxpayer on the other hand as we understand it says, “No.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.081" offset="1251662">You must disregard the period that the tax that the -- that we will use the asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.723" offset="1274232">You must disregard the price we will receive for the asset when we dispose of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.873" offset="1294817">You must disregard that despite the most compelling evidence of it, despite the past history of our business operations” and that really is a crystallization of what dispute comes down to in these three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.618" offset="1357824">Now, the question is of a major importance in the computation of income under the Internal Revenue Code because of dual aspects in which it affects taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.237" offset="1408293">First, depreciation is a deduction from gross income so that the larger the depreciation deduction, the less the gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.575" offset="1457716">On the other hand of course, the smaller the depreciation deduction, the greater the gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.341" offset="1480704">Of course gross income or net income on the tax returns would be taxed at what we call the ordinary income tax rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.405" offset="1516962">Those which can go to a maximum of 52% in the case of corporations and of course a good deal higher than 75, 80 and past that in the case of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.850" offset="1558758">On the other hand, the question of depreciation is important in another aspect and that is when the time comes for the taxpayer to dispose of his asset, his car, his plant, his piece of equipment, his electric motor, whatever it may be, when that time comes, he has made a sale, let us say we must determine what is the gain or the loss which he has realized upon the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.267" offset="1672443">Now, in order to do that, we must determine what the taxpayer's basis for the asset is.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.805" offset="1698565">Basis is another way for our purposes at least here of describing the cost to the taxpayer, if he paid a thousand dollars for it that is his basis or his cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.159" offset="1740048">On the other hand, when the time comes to sell it to the extent that he has taken depreciation deductions, to that extent he has already recovered tax-free his cost and so we must reduce the basis by the amount of depreciation and consequently the larger the amount of depreciation the larger the deduction from his cost and the lower the basis; on the other hand the smaller the depreciation deduction, the higher the basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.548" offset="1853524">Now, this is very material because in computing the gain or loss, we match the basis with the sales proceeds so that if the taxpayer has a low basis as he would if he took large depreciation deductions, he would show larger gain upon the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.172" offset="1932100">Now, the significance of the larger gain upon the sale is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.374" offset="1948818">Under the provisions of the code, the gain upon the sale of these assets used in a trade or business which are subject to depreciation is taxable at capital gain rates which are a maximum of 25% so that it is to a taxpayer's advantage to increase the amount of depreciation because although by increasing depreciation he lowers basis and consequently increases profits upon a sale when he ultimately disposes of the asset, he is very, very happy to pay larger -- larger tax of 25% by -- by taking the advantage of greater depreciation deductions which are worth to him 52% in the case of most corporations and perhaps more in the case of various individuals.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.582" offset="2237733">I would say that even if the -- there were no capital gain rate applicable upon the disposition of these assets, even if it with the same tax rate in each instance, there would still be a disproportion and a distortion in the report of the taxpayer's income and it would still be offensive to our notions of what the purpose of the depreciation deduction should serve.</text>

            <text syncTime="556.635" offset="2329893">You wouldn't have such extreme economic differences as it does under the present?</text>

          <turn speaker="howard_a_heffron" startTime="561.162" stopTime="601.055">
            <label>Mr. Howard A. Heffron</label>
            <text syncTime="561.162" offset="2347969">Well, I say as a general proposition, it would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.473" offset="2357269">In a case of any particular taxpayer might be of great importance to him whether he took more for depreciation in the year one or whether he took less in the year one and had different consequence in the years two or three.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.076" offset="2407633">So that, I think we're dealing here with the fundamental concept which is not -- not determined by the difference in the tax rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.247" offset="2436368">I suggest that difference merely to indicate the motivation for taxpayer, in this instance taking a position which increases the amount of depreciation although at a cost of paying a greater capital gains tax when the time comes to dispose of the asset.</text>

          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="601.055" stopTime="611.149">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="601.055" offset="2507630">So, it will make no difference to you so far as your position is concerned whether he reported as -- as ordinary income or as a capital gain?</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard A. Heffron</label>
            <text syncTime="611.149" offset="2547963">I would - I would say that our position would not be different if upon a sale of the asset the taxpayer would have pay an ordinary income tax upon the gain on the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.236" offset="2592266">Our position is not dependent upon the applicability of that difference in rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.172" offset="2616090">Our position follows, we believe, from our view with the fundamental nature of the depreciation deduction and the -- an attempt to prevent a distortion of income over the years which the taxpayer is using the asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.846" offset="2678784">Now, in the Evans' case, the case arises under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and again, here, I can capsulate very simply, Evans bought cars cheaply because he was in the rental business and he could get a discount price from new car dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.079" offset="2759659">On the other hand, when he finished using them in his rental business, he could sell them on an awfully good price in the wholesale market.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.956" offset="2791215">For example, in one of the years in issue, 1951, the difference is spread between what Evans paid for these cars when new and what he received for them when he sold them as used cars was only a $100 on the average.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.986" offset="2863313">But Mr. Evans contends that he is entitle to deduct for deprecation that is as evidencing the cost to him of using the car in his rental business $450, four and a half times what in our view is the actual cost to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.845" offset="2934784">Now the result for Mr. Evans is a very, very pleasant result.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="717.471" offset="2973236">He bases that $450 on what?</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard A. Heffron</label>
            <text syncTime="722.025" offset="2991522">He bases that $450 depreciation on the theory that he may disregard the time he actually uses the car in his rental business.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.770" offset="3030497">He may disregard the proceeds which he receives when he disposes of that car and computed depreciation on some other basis, a basis which I can only describe as one which envisions a hypothetical taxpayer in business who on the hypothetical conditions uses this hypothetical car for approximately on the average four years and who when he disposes of it at the end of that four-year period realizes nothing, he junks the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.198" offset="3148152">Now, taking that view, four years will allow him to deduct 25% of the cost of his asset each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.545" offset="3185560">Well, 25% of the average car let's say which cost $1600 is $400 in one year but Mr. Evans uses these cars on the average longer than one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.182" offset="3232057">On the other hand, when he sells them on the open market, he gets back only $100 less than he paid for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.621" offset="3261837">Now, it's the Government's position that you can't disregard these salient economic facts affecting Mr. Evans' business.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.875" offset="3290885">If he uses the car for only 15 months which is what the tax court found as to sum of these cars, it may not assume he will use it for four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.078" offset="3327666">There is no basis for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.697" offset="3334144">On the other hand, if when he sells the cars, he recoups almost all of his cost about $100, it distorts his income to permit him to reflect on his tax return that the use of the assets for the period covered by the return is actually cost him $450 rather than the $100.</text>

            <text syncTime="1488.276" offset="6056521">Now, if I can give a concrete example of the results of the taxpayer's theory, let us assume that a car cost $2000, on the taxpayer's theory, he is entitled to take in the course of two years, 50% of the value of that car because he assumes it lasts four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.289" offset="6136560">So he has taken a thousand dollars as a deduction for his cost of using the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.976" offset="6159235">Well, if the taxpayer at the end of that two-year period sells the car for $1500, the car has only costing 500.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.731" offset="6186297">He is taking $500 too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.079" offset="6195702">One the other hand, if he sells the car for $500, but use of the car for that two-year period has cost him $1500.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.336" offset="6224750">He is taking $500 too little.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.045" offset="6235512">Now, if the objective here is the recovery of cost, we say that this method is purely arbitrary and only fortuitously by accident results in the recovery of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.034" offset="6283473">Under the Government's theory, if you could show as has been shown in these cases that the taxpayer customarily disposed of the car in two years and that in on the one hand, he customarily received $1500 when he dispose of it, he would only deduct 500 over the two-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.659" offset="6350033">On the other hand, another taxpayer who customarily disposed of the car in two years received $500 upon disposal, he would be entitled to deduct $1500 over the two-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.524" offset="6397471">In this way, we say that the matching of costs and income is met because after all, what we are seeking here is to match the cost of producing particular income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.637" offset="6449925">The car, the tangible asset, whatever it was, was used in producing income, that income is shown on the return.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.186" offset="6860152">From the time allotted I hope to explore three areas in very brief fashion of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.089" offset="6891708">The first the peculiar paradox in which the Government finds itself as a result of this attempt to change the long established definitions of useful life and salvage value, a paradox resulting from the fact of the Government's brief in this case and counsel's argument this afternoon are completely irreconcilable with something which counsel did not mention, 40 years of consistent administration of depreciation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.493" offset="7017305">Second, the repeated attempts made by the Government to get Congress to bring about the result which the Government is now asking this Court to bring about in a different method, in different way entirely by the redefinition of useful life and a salvage value, all which attempts were rejected by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.421" offset="7109047">Third, the very great risks the Government is taking in connection with areas of the depreciation field which are not even before the Court and that suggests and which maybe radically affected if the Government succeeds in all returning these long accepted, recognized, approved principles of depreciation in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.240" offset="7204342">Now, before beginning on the first of those, I do want to say preliminarily that the third case of these three old cases, the Massey case is not in our opinion a companion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.884" offset="7262960">We are not interested in the third case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.027" offset="7271528">We do not represent the taxpayer in the third case and we consider it a case completely different from Evans and Hertz.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.385" offset="7300890">Evans and Hertz, however, stand on the same bottom although there is a difference which we'll develop when we get into the Hertz case, a technical difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.462" offset="7337253">I also would like to make sure that counsel has not inadvertently misled the Court in describing the length of time over which the taxpayer, both in Evans and in Hertz and all taxpayers for many long years back of this take depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.719" offset="7442265">The depreciation deduction is of course actually taken, the dollar depreciation deduction is of course actually taken only for the number of years we retained the assets, the depreciable assets, but at the rate -- the rate of depreciation at -- the rate at which we depreciate the assets is the total useful life.</text>

            <text syncTime="1918.869" offset="7778826">However, the real point is that the Government is trying to carry back even to this Evans case which arises under the 1939 code, the same concepts, the same definitions of useful life and salvage value which -- which appeared for the first time which began so far as the Government was concerned with its 1956 regulations, it is really trying to carry back the concepts in the 1956 regulations and now first this paradox, which the Government presents to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.476" offset="7933262">The Government is now contending for adoption of -- its definition of useful life as the taxpayer's holding period and its definition of salvage value as the value of the asset whenever it is sold, that is the price obtained for it, not the value at the expiration of the full useful life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.395" offset="8016959">And to hear counsel, it would seem that there really never was any other accepted idea about useful life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.163" offset="8063979">And just to make sure that we understand each other about useful life and salvage value and their connection, may I say this that really the issue, the solid issue, the important issue between the Government and the taxpayer in this case and in the -- the Hertz case is whether the useful life of the taxpayer's automobiles is the whole physical life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.077" offset="8155721">The inherent functional life for general business purposes as the taxpayer contends or the period during which the automobiles are held by the taxpayer in a given case by the given taxpayer as the Government contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.782" offset="8214549">And the reason I say, that's really the solid issue between us is that the salvage value issue which of course is very important grows out of the useful life issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.281" offset="8264495">If the -- and -- and the resolution of the useful life issue will automatically resolve what is salvage value because the parties agree in this case, if the Court please, that salvage value is the residue after useful life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.145" offset="8343907">Now, if the useful life is the whole useful life, the whole physical life of the asset, then, salvage value is the residue junk salvage value left at the end of the full useful life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.782" offset="8418513">If the useful life, if the proper definition of useful life is as the Government contends the holding period, then salvage value is the value at the end of that period, the end of “useful life” defined that way and it is of course greater in value then than the salvage value at the end of the full physical life, the taxpayer's definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2135.319" offset="8644629">In our briefs, we asked the Government to give us a single case in the whole history of depreciation legislation and litigation prior to this court litigation now before this Court in which at every contended for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.515" offset="8713383">Now, we didn't say establish because it is clearly never done that, but a single case in which he have had contended for the definitions for which it now contends in this case and in the Hertz case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2168.268" offset="8776495">On the other hand, we have included in our briefs cases decided by the Board of Tax Appeals by the Tax Court, by District Courts, by the Court of Appeal just to -- one or two of which I want to go into here in a moment in which the Commissioner was not just silent about what is useful life and what is salvage value, but in which he contended for three-year and four-year and five-year and six-year lives for automobiles which he knew had been sold when he made that contention after two years or after one year or after seven months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.345" offset="8928737">In all those cases, the Commissioner was contending that the rate of depreciation to be applied was the rate established on the basis of the full physical life of the asset, if it was four years for automobiles and there is no other testimony in either, Evans or Hertz that it is anything else, four years for automobiles and the rate of depreciation said the Government in those cases was 25%.</text>

            <text syncTime="2330.534" offset="9425481">But one of the most interesting examples to illustrate how completely the Government has about to face is Pen versus Commissioner, 199 F.2d. 210, a case decided in 1952.</text>

            <text syncTime="2349.557" offset="9501550">She proceeded to take depreciation on it at a rate based on her holding period i.e. here life expectancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.171" offset="9532061">The Commission -- the Commissioner referred to that idea of taking depreciation over a useful life defined by the holding period as “a novel contention” and said there was no basis for computing annual deductions for depreciation on the basis of the period of use by that taxpayer “rather than on a basis of the useful life of the property itself.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2397.373" offset="9692871">Now, taxpayer's argument, I must remind the Court, is the very argument which the Government makes these briefs in this case and in the Hertz case and which counsel makes this afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.747" offset="9730382">“The basic fallacy in that argument” said the Government, “was in that taxpayer's assumption that the measure of the period of depreciation was something other than the life of property itself and that the taxpayer was disregarding” as indeed, the Government now disregards, was disregarding the fact that depreciation is a matter of wear and tear of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.654" offset="9845948">And finally, the Government's brief in that case actually said, “On taxpayer's theory, every owner of the depreciable interest in property would be entitled to deduct annual depreciation at a rate based on a number of years he expects to enjoyed in, expect to live, and enjoy the income from the property instead of the number of years the property may be expected to produce income.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.120" offset="9951901">And in its brief in that case, the Government actually refers to the taxpayer's theory, the holding period theory the Court just heard about from the counsel as leading to “a result repugnant to the fundamental concepts of depreciation” and I must agree completely with the Government in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3434.643" offset="13841951">When the third attempt was made, it was made in the Courts in the Filbert case in 1956, Third Circuit case, and also at first in this Evans' case by attempting the elimination of -- of -- or at least drastic reduction of capital gains in connection with the sale of automobiles used in renting and leasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.488" offset="13965354">Not having succeeded with Congress, it tried the courts, but the Court in Filbert would not permit them to maintain as they tried to do in Evans' also that the taxpayer in a renting and leasing business was a dealer in automobiles and therefore could not take depreciation at all and the attack was abandoned by the Government in the Evans' case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3627.225" offset="14612250">The cases which the counsels cites are cases which used the term useful life in the sense in which Mr. Justice Frankfurter used that, in the model, in the abstract sense and -- those were cases where the question was, is the taxpayer holding the cars to sell them or is he holding them for some other purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.912" offset="14687065">And the Government said, “Well, he's holding them less than the useful life” meaning the abstract model, useful life sense, therefore, he's not holding them to use them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.658" offset="14726040">He's holding them to sell them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.411" offset="14733040">That was the only point of using the term in that way and there has to be a way to describe this abstract concept, this model useful life, but it's always applied to the taxpayer and what we are talking about in these cases are not useful life in the abstract, but the taxpayers useful life because we're trying to give the taxpayer back his cost in terms of tax deductions and to define useful life in terms which have no pertinence or relevance to the taxpayer's own cost or his own mode of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.239" offset="14864280">It gives no guarantee whatever that he will recover his cost through the depreciation deductions because after all, the regulation provides that the proper amount is the amount which should be aggregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.514" offset="14913390">Now, we say that aggregate amount must assume that we're talking about an aggregation which will occur over a period that a taxpayer is using the property because to aggregate it over some other period makes no sense as -- for example in the taxpayer's example of asset which has a 10-year abstract life, if you know the taxpayer will sell it in two years or in five years to aggregate 10% a year for two years or five years does not give the taxpayer back his cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.137" offset="15031881">We say in that situation, you must take a period of time to with the time the taxpayer reasonably expects to use the property whether a two, five, or 10 years then you have a period whose aggregate will realize cost, otherwise, you cannot realize cost.</text>
