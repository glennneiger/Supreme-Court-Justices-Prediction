            <text syncTime="34.466" offset="241246">Trial court said that although petitioner denied having made these statements, the Board's summary.</text>

            <text syncTime="123.494" offset="597347">During that time, he made no effort to check the accuracy of his draft board file.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.829" offset="622738">He admitted at the trial that he had the right to examine the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.101" offset="639770">He admitted that he had the right at the hearing before the department hearing, obviously go into this thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.386" offset="884903">And I would also like to point out that in this very case, first, he concedes that everything else in the statement except for this one paragraph relating to what he told the Board with respect to the number of hours is accurate, he doesn't deny that.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.041" offset="955538">Secondly, although, both the regulations and the selective service classification form require registrant to affect any change -- to report to the draft board any changes that may affect his status.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.456" offset="1069223">And indeed, when he came before the local board the second time at his interview in 1956, when he was asked if he had anything else to report instead of reporting that he had ceased his pioneering activities, he merely announced that he was now married and produced a copy of his marriage certificate.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.214" offset="1568266">Mr. Chief Justice, since all the members of this organization claimed to be ministers and since it's clear that they are not all entitled to a draft, deferment because of their ministerial status, the dividing line of the selective service has drawn as between the pioneer status, because the pioneer was the man who is in effect acting as the pastor.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.248" offset="1652381">Now, if he would temporarily without a pastor, of course this wouldn't make any difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="452.931" offset="1915068">I think his claim is not that these papers were necessary to establish whether he had or had not made a misstatement but that these papers were necessary in order him to show additional affirmative evidence to support his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.516" offset="1973478">That is evidence of his sincerity.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.981" offset="1983300">In this case, there is nothing that was dealt with at the hearing before the Department of Justice hearing officer relating to the amount of time he devoted to preaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.943" offset="2035127">And also, with respect to the FBI reports which are contained in the -- summarized in the resume.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.407" offset="2065011">There too, the only thing relied on in the resume as the basis for the Department's recommendation was the fact that he was then only devoting six and half hours to preach in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.760" offset="2118405">The Department has not -- has not here questioned all the additional material relating to his good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.423" offset="2149021">The resume is set forth to page 178 to 180 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.208" offset="2172217">And the -- only one incident in the resume that it's unfavorable and that related to a fact, the petitioner had once been picked up by the police or it was claimed that he had attempted to pick some women up on a street late at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.509" offset="2225403">He denied that.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.525" offset="2229478">The resume shows his denial and the hearing officer has set forth in the Department's recommendation, indicated that we were not relying on that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.310" offset="2268662">So the whole issue in this case basically, is whether he did make these misstatements before the local board.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.565" offset="2301680">His claims as to his demand for the hearing officer's report as for his claim that he is entitled to see the FBI reports, he does not, as I understand it, claim that these reports would tend to support his argument that he had not made those misrepresentations, rather is that this was necessarily to see whether the resume fully set forth all the favorable evidence to his case.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.656" offset="2573981">And while he -- he makes a number of charges and says that he would prove this and show that the hearing was unfair, we think that in the narrow factual posture of this case, those issues aren't properly presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.904" offset="2631032">Now, in the case of the resume, he does not now argue that the -- he -- well, he says he doesn't know whether the resume fairly summarized the unfavorable material.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.740" offset="2682337">We think the answer to that is that he has not prejudiced as long as there is nothing which forms the basis for the Department's recommendation that is not set forth in the resume.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.463" offset="2729253">Now, the reason the resume set forth nothing with respect to the claim -- claim of exaggeration is because at that stage of the case, when you merely had the summary of the favorable and unfavorable evidence in the FBI report, this issue hasn't been brought into the case yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.926" offset="2795081">I want to emphasize that since this -- this Court's decision in the Nugent case, the Department has filed the practice of giving registrants a resume not only of the unfavorable evidence but also of the favorable evidence and that is set forth in the resume on this -- in this case at page 178.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.673" offset="2874075">There are set forth three rather tightly neat paragraphs indicating that generally, this man is regarded as a sincere person.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.246" offset="2904377">The unfavorable evidence of necessity which is the incident with respect to his being picked up by the police, of necessity, this is some -- set forth in somewhat greater detail because the whole purpose of the resume as Nugent indicated is to give him an opportunity to meet the unfavorable evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.854" offset="2982745">Now, the petitioner was -- in accordance with this Court's decision in the Gonzales case, given a copy of the Department's recommendation to the appeal board before the appeal board considerer the case and he in turn was given 30 days within which to answer that recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.025" offset="3071457">He answered that recommendation as set forth in a letter shown at page 182 of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1772.609" offset="7193788">I'd like to comment on the answer of counsel to Mr. Justice Brennan's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.341" offset="7228688">As a matter of fact, this entire draft board file was sent as I told the Court in my opening argument, within three hours after this hearing was held because it was mailed on the very day that the hearing was held on August 17th, this paper number 42 shows it was mailed on that day and the record shows the hearing was held at 1:30 in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.381" offset="7320848">By -- by the time business closed on that day, this was on the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.008" offset="7343417">And after that, he had no opportunity to see that file or inspect it and that's what I tried to bring out at the trial at -- at the hearing officer's hearing, which was the only opportunity that he ever had to look at the file, the hearing officer did not notify him, or give him any clue to suspect that the local Board had mailed such -- made -- made such a memoranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.577" offset="7453654">And the file was not shown to him by the hearing officer and I went into this matter, tried to go into it at the trial and that was one of the reasons that I subpoenaed the hearing officer's report of what took place at the hearing because I thought the official report would be the best record of what took place at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.201" offset="7520214">And I wanted to prove and attempted to do it in any every human way that a lawyer could do it, that this hearing officer did not bring to him this business about these memoranda that had been filed with the local board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.368" offset="7584893">The only time that he ever learned of this alleged exaggeration is when this recommendation of the Department of Justice was sent to him by the appeal board which as I say, too little and too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.386" offset="7628884">And even it, in the recommendation, does not even give him a clue that there was a memoranda made by the local board on this point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1891.132" offset="7667858">It's pure and simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.607" offset="7673814">From the time of this hearing, they were in such a big hurry to get this case under the local board's hand that they couldn't wait five days for him to have the usual opportunity to make an inspection of the file and see whether the Board had prepared something false against him which they had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.071" offset="7739643">And as I say, he didn't learn it until the day before we went to trial in Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.555" offset="7773602">So the file was not available at anytime until we got a photostatic copy of the file following the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.905" offset="7807039">And then, it was entirely too late to do anything except to try to make the defense that we did attempt to make in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.943" offset="7847163">He told the Court that the only question involved in this cases is what the Court said in the Estep case about their being no basis in fact, but Justice Douglas went on to say in there, also that if there had been a violation of pursuit in due process, then even though if there was a basis in fact for the granting of the -- no,-- I mean no basis in fact for the giving of the classification procedural due process of law would invalidate it just like the a man maybe guilty of murder, but he has denied apparent fould.</text>

            <text syncTime="2608.091" offset="10535685">And for that matter, I say that Nugent, if it is meant to say that you have only a resume of the unfair evidence and omit the responsibility to make the summary of the fair evidence -- I mean the favorable evidence, it misconceives the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.597" offset="10609768">I say the reason the Court spoke only of unfair evidence is because -- unfavorable evidence is because that was the only question we argued and considered when we are here in the Nugent case in the 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.235" offset="10652296">And naturally, the Court did not have in its view the question of favorable evidence, but certainly, Congress intended that the favorable evidence be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.278" offset="10680508">Certainly, Congress didn't intend for some one-sided investigation and hearing to be conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.062" offset="10703600">It's outrageous since it is not an adversary proceedings and the intent of the investigation is to turn up favorable evidence as well as unfavorable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.436" offset="10745083">And we keep hammering at this thing and men are going to prison and a certiorari is such an uncertain thing to get in here, I know that the Court can deal only with the important questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.798" offset="10790536">You don't sit here as a court of error, but after this thing has been recurring so many times and would still get this prosecutions coming on, the question is dangling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.483" offset="10833272">There is an old way that the lawyer can do, except keep raising it and hammering away at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.533" offset="10849468">If the Court finally says that I'm wrong, I'll take it like I took it in the Nugent case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.700" offset="10882173">Now, that's -- I'm not criticizing the Court, I'm just merely explaining to the Court a situation of great serious importance that we've got in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.041" offset="10919581">That's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.538" offset="10921566">And until this Court resolves the question, we always run across some Judge like Judge Dawson in Seventh District to refuse to follow the Court of Appeals' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.836" offset="10962735">He flat-footedly refused to follow all of the Court of Appeals that have ruled against him in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.241" offset="10988335">Now, I think when Judge Dawson, a man of his reputation and integrity refuses to follow the Courts of Appeal, there's something wrong somewhere, respectfully submitted.</text>
