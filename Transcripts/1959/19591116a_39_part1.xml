            <text syncTime="30.009" offset="223378">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.294" offset="252531">This case involves the section of the Fair Labor Standards Act which makes it unlawful for any person to discharge or, in any other manner, discriminate against any employee because he has filed a complaint instituted a cause to be instituted any proceeding under or related to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.025" offset="343437">The section is quoted on page 2 of petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.625" offset="361827">The issue is with respect to the scope of the Court's power to restrain violations of this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.201" offset="404146">The question turns on the meaning of the jurisdictional language of Section 17 of the Act, which is also quoted on pages 2 to 3 of the petitioner's brief, which provides that the District Courts shall have jurisdiction for cause shown to restrain violations of Section 15 as a proviso in -- to that section which I'll show yet to you later but that -- since that was not the basis of the Court of Appeal's decision, I will defer reference to that until after meeting the grounds on which the decision below rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.435" offset="577076">The facts, the pertinent facts are not in dispute and as substantially as they were found by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.129" offset="607901">Immediately after service of the complaints on the respondents for the recovery of wages due some named employees, respondent and respondents who are the DeMario Corporation and Robert DeMario individually who's virtually the sole owner of the corporation and one of the office -- offices of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.294" offset="744573">The respondents immediately set out on a -- embarked on a course of discrimination against the employees in whose name these complaints were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.033" offset="795460">And by changing their seating arrangements and taunting them in various ways and assigning them less desirable work and other things of that nature within two weeks, all three of the employees had been discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.046" offset="867558">The trial court found that all three of these employees were relatively long-term employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.245" offset="896397">Two of them in particular had worked continuously for respondents longer than most, if not all the other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.785" offset="926490">There have never been any complaints about their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.938" offset="939133">And one who had worked the -- continuously for respondents for over three years were admittedly above average.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.961" offset="975182">And the trial court found that none of them would have been laid off had it not been for the filing of these suits or -- or if they have been laid off, they would long since had been reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.591" offset="1029726">The trial court concluded that this conduct clearly constituted a violation of Section 15 (a) 3, that the evidence was so clear and convincing that the Secretary was entitled to an injunction to restrain respondents from discriminating against the said employees and also to a mandatory order requiring respondents to reinstate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.743" offset="1126379">However, the Court declined to grant the Secretary's request for reimbursement for loss of wages resulting from the unlawful discharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.075" offset="1163682">The Court noted that the question of whether it had jurisdiction to order such reimbursement had been raised but that it said it was not necessary to rule on that question because in the exercise of its discretion, it would -- it would decline to order reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.075" offset="1243721">But it made no -- no findings as to mitigating circumstances and gave no reason for so exercising its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.095" offset="1283741">The Secretary appealed from the denial of the reimbursement and the respondents cross appeal from the order for reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.748" offset="1318327">The Court of Appeals affirmed sustaining the trial court in both respects, holding that there was authority to order reinstatement but that there was no corresponding authority to order reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.868" offset="1378826">And because of its ruling that there was no power, the Court of Appeals said it was unnecessary to reach the question whether the trial court had abused its discretion in declining to order the reimbursement.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="331.188" offset="1428146">Isn't it also true that the Court of Appeals said, for not reaching the question of discretion that if it should have to reach that question, the record before was insufficient?</text>

            <text syncTime="342.008" offset="1471404">Well, they said that not enough of it had been printed under the Court's rules of -- of -- redesignated only the findings of the Court to printing.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.353" offset="1508812">Respondent could have crossed designated and didn't, and the Court said, “Well, if they had to reach that question, they -- they can, of their own motion in that Court, order more of the record printed,” So they -- they didn't reach that question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.350" offset="1564818">If the Court of Appeals was wrong, the case probably would have to go back for consideration of that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.631" offset="1641932">The Fifth Circuit explicitly repudiated the Second Circuit's earlier decision in 1944 Walling v. O'Grady where the Second Circuit had held that the reimbursement power was a necessary power adequately to carry out the ex prohibition against a discriminatory discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.830" offset="1738689">The Fifth Circuit reasoned that the reimbursement remedy is unavailable unless expressly conferred by or necessarily implied from a specific congressional enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.280" offset="1792502">Now, it's the Government's position that the Second Circuit's decision in O'Grady was clearly correct, was and still is clearly correct, and that the Fifth Circuit simply ignored the legislative purpose of this statutory prohibition of discrimination and ignored also our -- applied just the opposite rule to the fundamental principle of statutory construction which this Court has consistently followed in construing comparable enforcement provisions of other regulatory statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.987" offset="1947355">The principle is that if a court's equity jurisdiction is invoked to restrain violations or to enforce compliance with a regulatory statute, its inherent equity -- equitable powers are available to effectuate legislative purposes and policy unless the statute expressly or by necessary inference provides otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.881" offset="2054875">Now, if time will not permit going in to all the decisions of this Court and the various distinctions that respondents undertake to make in those decisions, Porter v. Warner and the Phelps Dodge decision of course are the ones that state this principle most explicitly.</text>

            <text syncTime="683.020" offset="2835414">Our point is that it is -- it is something quite different from that, that the proviso in Section 17 was specifically and deliberately limited to recovery of unpaid wages under Section 6 and 7 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.705" offset="2898213">And that the reason it was so limited was because simultaneously, when that proviso was put in, in 1949, simultaneously, Congress enacted Section 16 (c) of the Act which gave the administrator or the Secretary authority to sue on behalf of employees for unpaid wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.168" offset="2980028">This is the first time the Secretary was given that express authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.001" offset="2995388">Prior thereto, the Court's had held that the Secretary could recover unpaid wages in an injunction action.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.704" offset="3030183">Congress enacted 16 (c) which puts certain limitations on the right -- on that right.Congress said he could bring this action at the -- upon the written request of the employees, only on written request and only if there was no unsettled question of law involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.529" offset="3117537">So it put the proviso in Section 17 in corresponding language obviously with the intent that if the Secretary was going to bring action on behalf of employees for wages, he should proceed under Section 16 (c) under the conditions and limitations of 16 (c) but they explicitly recognized that he could bring both the injunction action and a 16 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="781.084" offset="3227669">Well, 16 (c) has nothing whatsoever to do with the prohibition of discriminatory discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.903" offset="3254941">There's no comparable provision in the Act giving the employee a right to sue for damages under a loss of wages due to discharge.</text>
