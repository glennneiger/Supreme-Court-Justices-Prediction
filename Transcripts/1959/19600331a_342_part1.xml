            <text syncTime="164.705" offset="762232">Of the -- statute under inquiry here, provides that -- I think I'd better read it rather than quote it, that refusal to answer on any grounds shall be cause for immediate termination of such employee's employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.831" offset="858676">And this, the no provision is for hearing is afforded by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.047" offset="891591">There's no opportunity for the employee to explain his reason for failing to or refusing to sign the oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.889" offset="930879">Now, we submit that we concede that a State may inquire into the fitness of any employee and into the loyalty of any employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.432" offset="981138">But that inquiry must accord with fair procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.524" offset="1001514">There must be a hearing and an opportunity to defend himself or to explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.653" offset="1025964">This requirement was first acknowledged in the Adler case, Adler against the Board, but in that case, the Court found that the Feinberg Act of New York provided an adequate hearing opportunity to explain and in the -- even found that the Feinberg Act only gave rise to a prima facie presumption of disloyalty which would be overcome by any testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.719" offset="1174235">In the Slochower case, the Court recognized that when a person is -- well, the Slochower case was decide -- appears to have been decided on two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.604" offset="1229824">One was that the -- the claiming needs -- protection of the Fifth Amendment cannot give rise to a presumption of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.697" offset="1270157">And on the further that since there was no hearing afforded the employee that the summary dismissal of him was a denial of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.855" offset="1346748">We submit that that case is -- the reasoning of that case is directly applicable to this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.666" offset="1386036">Now, of course, the reasoning back of this is that a hearing is necessary to render this firing process or discharge process an inquiry into the fitness of the employee in any real sense, otherwise, the firing procedure bares only a broad sort of dragnet relationship to fitness or security of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.733" offset="1530337">It is an -- because there, it is -- well, it is an arbitrary classification of the fit with the unfit and firing of all of them in order to get at the lesser number who may -- who may be unfit or disloyal.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.273" offset="1628453">And insofar as it is -- is an arbitrary classification, it comes in conflict with the -- this Court's decision in Wieman against Updegraff, the signing -- the refusal of -- to sign the oath by itself bares no reasonable relationship to disloyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.856" offset="1730748">It is certainly a ground for suspicion of disloyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.569" offset="1757602">And that would give rise to maybe inquiry as to whether their suspicions were well founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.877" offset="1790830">But in and of itself, the -- it is improper for the legislature to say a refusal to take an oath means that the person shall be immediately discharged.</text>

            <text syncTime="2062.809" offset="8354565">In the few minutes remaining, I must(Inaudible)my argument considerably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.945" offset="8383195">The argument with respect to bill of attainder and with respect to the freedoms under the First Amendment, it had been stated much more eloquently than I could state them by Your Honors in the various cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.411" offset="8449024">I think, however, that there are one or two implications in each of these matters, which I would like to call to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.375" offset="8496880">Dealing with the question of the bill of attainder, if this Court will not reexamine the basis of Douds, we must confess the bill of attainder argument goes out the window.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.216" offset="8556231">We submit, however, that the bill of attainder argument which would dispose of in Douds was disposed of upon an erroneous basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.700" offset="8610147">If we look at the purpose of the proscription of the Communist Party in this particular case, I think it becomes quite apparent that the purpose is to punish that which we cannot otherwise be constitutionally punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.139" offset="8675976">Its purpose is to discourage ideas, to discourage associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.526" offset="8701471">There is no real rational relationship to fitness of the individual who may be a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.801" offset="8742536">It is an inference drawn that by virtue of the fact that he is a member of the Communist Party, he is a fortiori unfit to teach in the universities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.656" offset="8798020">Now, the -- as I read Douds, it seems to say that the oath requirement in Douds would have been considered a bill of attainder except for the fact that it had present and prospective application only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.869" offset="8874820">And therefore, it should not be deemed a bill of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.038" offset="8899480">We submit that the constitutional provision prohibiting bills of attainder and ex post facto laws being in the disjunctive intended to exclude two separate categories of laws which the founders of the Constitution deem to be improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.650" offset="9001984">There were at least three historic examples of bills of attainder which were prospective in application which were before the constitutional convention, these matters are cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.778" offset="9078471">And undoubtedly, there must have been a reason for including the bill of attainder along with the ex post facto provision in our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.700" offset="9142209">It -- I think it's significant that there was no discussion at all in the constitutional convention with respect to the acceptance of the prohibition against a bill of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.592" offset="9201768">There was some discussion about the inclusion of the prohibition against ex post facto laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.845" offset="9230712">And there was some colloquy where it was said, there is no reason to include ex post facto laws because every lawyer, every civilian knows obviously those are illegal and unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.205" offset="9288182">But bills of attainder were not deemed to be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.969" offset="9311274">They were passed by the Georgia legislature, they have been passed by Pennsylvania legislature, and they have been passed by the New York legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.275" offset="9348472">We found though that there were bills of attainder which were -- which were prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.996" offset="9379401">And I think that the greatest example of that was the great bill of attainder act was passed by the Dublin parliament under James II.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.065" offset="9443662">Now, with respect to the First Amendment and the freedoms guaranteed thereunder, it is our position that the language in Adler has been tempered by Your Honors' holding in the Sweezy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.902" offset="9519000">And this, I think, is as it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.817" offset="9530598">I think that we must consider the necessity for controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.156" offset="9552018">We must consider the necessity for decent at a university when it is unrelated to the fitness of the individual teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.654" offset="9597994">The clear and present danger, I assume, that we are talking about which the legislature may -- may legislate against is that of having incompetent teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.224" offset="9660270">Now, let us assume this example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.820" offset="9670614">Let us assume we have a perfectly competent teacher at a university, and he comes to the regions of the university, and he said, “Gentlemen, I have become a neo-fascist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.230" offset="9732263">I believe that we should engage in a change in our constitutional form of government so that we have a neo-fascist dictatorship in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.765" offset="9782418">I am not going to do anything about this in my classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.510" offset="9801435">I intend to devote, however, my free time outside of the classroom to my political activity in this party.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.866" offset="9850859">Now, to me, there is very little difference, very little distinction between that and, for example, the teacher who may be a member of the NAACP.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.013" offset="9907388">The question must be what relationship -- what danger is there to his views and beliefs being injected into his teaching, into his competency as a teacher.</text>

            <text syncTime="4519.944" offset="18183189">It does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4528.121" offset="18215894">The appellants' argument regarding both procedural and substantive due process seems to hinge on five cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4535.539" offset="18245569">I think that we can approach the heart of the argument if we approach these five cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4541.616" offset="18269811">The appellants relied upon the Slochower case, the Schware case, the Konigsberg case, the Adler case and the case of Wieman against Updegraff.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.187" offset="18312129">Now, we submit that these cases can be distinguished that these cases are not authority for the proposition that the 1955 Act is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4562.302" offset="18352567">In the Slochower case, the vice of that case was the fact that the investigation was not made by the school authority but the school authority drew a wrongful inference on the basis of an investigation made by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.484" offset="18413275">There's no need to deliver this point here because this point was made by the Court itself in the Beilan case and case of Globe against Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.605" offset="18453817">Now, in the Adler case, the appellants argue that because an administrative hearing was necessary in the Adler case, it would be a depravation of procedural due process not to afford a hearing in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.756" offset="18510346">And here, we come to one distinction which is perhaps the greatest distinction in the entire line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4608.523" offset="18537514">New York's Feinberg Law referred not only to present membership in an organization but the Fienberg Law said that a person could be dismissed for having committed the act of joining a subversive organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.017" offset="18603447">Here, we are concerned only with present membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.313" offset="18620583">Now, it's understandable that if a person can be dismissed for mere past membership, it might well be a constitutional requirement that this person be afforded a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.888" offset="18662902">But in the present case, where it is only present membership, it is not necessarily to inquire into the reasons why he resigned from the party because he didn't resign, reasons why he joined, the Court was interested in seeing that a person did not wrongfully suffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4656.249" offset="18728417">If a person is knowingly, presently a member of a subversive organization, we submit they could not be held to be innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.557" offset="18773556">Now, one of the most important cases bearing upon this case is the case of Wieman against Updegraff.</text>
            <text syncTime="4673.750" offset="18798320">Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked a question earlier, he said, “Was the oath in the Wieman case similar to the oath in the present case?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.697" offset="18834160">The answer to that is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="4684.737" offset="18842311">The oath in the Wieman case was different because it referred not only to present membership in a subversive organization but it also went back, I believe, five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.989" offset="18887346">In other words, in the case of Wieman against Updegraff, if a young person were to join an organization, maybe even the Communist Party, were to learn of its true aims and were to resign from the party within a week, that fact which stand as a bar to his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.715" offset="18958190">In this case, there is no such impediment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.540" offset="18969579">Now, because the Oklahoma Act would bar a person from employment who innocently joined an organization which was actually subversive, this Court held that it violated -- it was a deprivation without due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.975" offset="19031228">In the present case, it is difficult to see how a person could say that he is innocent, either he knows of the -- the purposes of an organization or he does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.900" offset="19078980">If he does not know the purposes of an organization, he would automatically sign the oath.And it's difficult to see how he could be held guilty of perjury.</text>

            <text syncTime="5178.993" offset="20819362">It's true the -- the Court must balance the effect upon the individual with the societal interest to do that in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5187.659" offset="20854053">But here, the legislature has said that they do not want people who are presently members of the Communist Party or other subversive organization to hold sensitive positions in our government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5199.569" offset="20901700">Now, there's no need to dwell upon the communist danger.</text>

            <text syncTime="5208.287" offset="20936495">I think this Court, itself, in the Adler case pointed out that there was a danger of communist propaganda to settle, to allow detection being disseminated in our classrooms.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.392" offset="20988949">This is the danger which the legislature was seeking to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5224.863" offset="21002846">And we submit that on the basis of the case law of this Court, the legislature had a right to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5233.426" offset="21037119">There are two cases which are almost exactly in point both of them were referred to by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.156" offset="21063973">The first case is the case of the American Communications Association against Douds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5245.415" offset="21085080">The second case is the Gerende against Board of Election case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5249.967" offset="21103261">Now, we submit that the distinction made by counsel in the case of American Communications Association against Douds is a distinction without a meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.523" offset="21145475">In the Douds case, this Court held that Congress had a right to have a non-communist affidavit and to demand that union leaders, who are members of union seeking to avail themselves in the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, signed this non -- this non-communist affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.073" offset="21231679">This is very similar to the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5283.973" offset="21239306">In that case, the Court held that the danger of political strikes was sufficient to justify this abridgement of the right of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.194" offset="21284133">The Court held that the action that Congress had taken was reasonably related to the danger involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.007" offset="21307434">We submit that is true in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.490" offset="21317360">Now, the distinction that counsel pointed to by saying that it affected the individual only indirectly by providing that the labor union could not avail itself of the National Labor Relations Act is a distinction ought to mean because it had the effect of discouraging Communist Party membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="5322.528" offset="21393533">It had the effect of affecting future action the same as the requirement -- the affidavit requirement in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.608" offset="21429791">Now, it's true, the -- in the Gerende case, there was only a per curiam decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.876" offset="21454869">But on the other hand, the plain holding of that case is, the plain effect to that case is a that a person who is a member of the Communist Party was not able to sign the oath and to be elected to office in the guise of belonging to one of the major established parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5355.143" offset="21523937">There again, the Court inferentially at least held that the danger of this happening was sufficiently great to force a man to come forward and state his views.</text>
            <text syncTime="5369.698" offset="21582137">Because of the limited time remaining, I will not spend much time on the bill of attainder argument especially since counsel concedes that under the law, this Court should hold that there is no bill of attainder in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5385.680" offset="21646085">He is asking that the Court overturn its holding in the Garner case and in the Douds case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.662" offset="21682030">Our point would be this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5396.044" offset="21687568">Since there is no penalty involved, since there is no penalty involved in the Douds case, there is no penalty involved in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5404.093" offset="21719751">And if there is no penalty involved in the present case, it would constitute a mere advisory opinion for this Court to state that a bill of attainder could be prospective in operation as well as being retrospective in operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5810.626" offset="23345925">I've given my reaction on it and I can do no more, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5815.385" offset="23364942">Turning just for one moment to the claim, the third argument of the appellants that the 1955 Act constitutes a violation of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5831.443" offset="23429099">I think we will first point to the case upon which the appellants rely and then attempt to show that some of the cases which support our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5845.672" offset="23486046">Now, the principal case which was cited was the case of West Virginia State Board of Education against Barnette.</text>
            <text syncTime="5854.823" offset="23522617">We submit that this case can be distinguished from the present case because in the case of West Virginia State Board Education against Barnette, this Court held that the Government could not force a man to profess something in which he did not believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="5872.132" offset="23591894">In the present case, we are forcing a man to profess as to what he does belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5878.586" offset="23617703">Now, there is a difference in the interest of the government to be protected because in the West Virginia case, the Government could show no interest in forcing to a man to go through a ritual to say something which he did not believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="5891.749" offset="23670366">But here, the interest in protecting the children and the students in the schools is sufficient, we submit, to warrant the restriction and the rights of an individual to force him to come forward and make a positive statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5910.361" offset="23744867">We submit that there is an entire line of cases which holds that the 1955 Act is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5921.157" offset="23788022">We submit that Douds case is authority for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5925.221" offset="23804217">In addition, there's the case of United Public Workers against Mitchell involving the Hatch Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5931.293" offset="23828564">In that case, this Court held that the interest of the Government in maintaining a loyal civil service was sufficient to warrant the abridgement of the rights of those civil servants to the extent that they could not engage and I believe the words were actual -- active political management.</text>
            <text syncTime="5953.564" offset="23917589">Again, in the Garner case, the Court held that the City of Los Angeles had a right to force a man to come forward and make statement that the interest of the State in maintaining loyal employees was sufficient to justify that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5971.293" offset="23988537">Now, finally, and this is the final case that I wish to mention to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5975.322" offset="24004629">There is the recent case of Speiser against Randall.</text>
            <text syncTime="5978.095" offset="24015705">And at first blush, it maybe surprising that I would mention this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5981.963" offset="24031274">It will be noted that it is not cited in the appellant's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5985.791" offset="24046529">Even though the courts stuck down an oath this case and to my knowledge this and the case of Wieman against Updegraff are the only recent cases were an oath has been struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="5996.437" offset="24089161">Even though an oath was struck down in this case, there is still language in that case to the effect that where the requirement more limited, had the requirement applied to a more specific group such as perhaps school teachers or such as perhaps union leaders as in the -- the Douds case require the -- the Act may have been saved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6026.928" offset="24211101">So the Court not only made the distinction by, in our opinion, reaffirm these previous acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6036.412" offset="24249031">In conclusion, let me say that it's always difficult for a lawyer to ask for an abridgement to any sort of human liberty, to ask for restriction of that liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.867" offset="24294797">But there are times when a restriction is necessary as is shown by the opinions of this Court, and we submit that this is one of those times.</text>
