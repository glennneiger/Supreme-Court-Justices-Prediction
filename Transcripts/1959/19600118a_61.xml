            <text syncTime="25.956" offset="207182">This case continued from last Thursday, presents a novel and unique issue of statutory interpretation by the Federal Trade Commission of Section 2 (c), the so-called brokerage clause of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.060" offset="275623">Briefly, what we have here was an open and competitive price reduction by a seller to a buyer coupled with the acceptance by a broker of a lower rated commission, a price which has the earmarks of legality under those provisions of the statute relating to prices, the grant by sellers and the receipt by buyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.593" offset="385755">Instead of proceeding or invoking the provisions of the statute relating to prices by buyers and sellers under the statute, the Federal Trade Commission in this case invoked for the first time in the history of the Robinson-Patman Act over two decades, the theory under Section 2 (c), the brokerage clause, that the broker in this case by accepting a lower rate of commission on this transaction was guilty of having paid indirectly a so-called allowance in lieu of brokerage to the buyer.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.476" offset="537266">Is this the first complaint, you say, that's been filed of this character?</text>

            <text syncTime="112.570" offset="553671">This is a unique situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.558" offset="561612">It was the first complaint of this sort filed in the history of the statute where the charge was that the broker's acceptance of a lower rate of commission was tantamount to his having paid over an indirect allowance in lieu of brokerage to the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.472" offset="629217">The argument of the Commission to which we addressed ourselves on Thursday was principally the policy justification by the Commission for bringing this type of proceeding and for vindicating it, rather than the statutory basis and the -- the precedence which bear on the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.580" offset="713644">To summarize very briefly, on Thursday, we stated that the position of the Commission, namely, that its interpretation of the statute here was compatible with the policy of the Robinson-Patman Act against discrimination and in favor of the small merchant.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.381" offset="796923">Our position was that this was not the fact in neither event because the policy of the Robinson-Patman Act as interpreted by this Court quite recently in the Simplicity Pattern opinion and also previously in the Morton Salt case was to promote and foster open price reductions based on cost economies for the benefit of the customer and ultimately the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.555" offset="889605">And moreover, that the contention -- that the policy of this case was in favor of the small merchant was rather paradox in view of the fact that the respondent here was a small brokerage partnership against which the Commission has proceeded rather than invoking the pertinent provisions of the statute against either the buyer or the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.841" offset="974764">And moreover, in view of the fact that a brokerage institution survey and study prepared by the Federal Trade Commission Chief Economist after the main briefs in this case were filed and which we have referred to in our supplemental brief has come to the conclusion that the Commission's application of this particular provision, the so-called brokerage clause has been more prejudicial and detrimental to the small independent distributor than it has been to the Chain-Store against which purportedly the Commission's objectives in enforcing this section or directive.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederick M. Rowe</label>
            <text syncTime="293.151" offset="1276008">Mr. Chief Justice, in this case, I also pointed out that the petition filed by the Solicitor General in this case carried a special and -- as I consider, unusual notation, at page 12 in the petition for certiorari which states, if I may read it quickly, “That in appearing herein as legal representative of the Commission, the Department of Justice intimates no views of its own as to the underlying policy consideration that maybe involved,” that is on page 12 in the footnote of the Solicitor General's petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.343" offset="1456776">We deem as particularly significant, Mr. Chief Justice, in view of the fact that we had urged from the outset of this proceeding that the net effect of the Commission's application of the statute would be in effect to prevent brokerage commissions from being reduced in the course of competitive price bargaining and we felt would interpolate into the Robinson-Patman Act in effect, the principle of fair trade or resale price maintenance even though there was no such objective by the Congress and even though similar arrangements where by in other industries such as among real estate brokers where brokerage commission had been stabilized that such mechanism for stabilizing brokerage commission had been outlawed as unlawful and unreasonable restraints of trade in suits brought by the Antitrust Division by the Department of Justice and of course, the case of the real estate brokers was affirmed here by this Court in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.117" offset="1687803">In short, we attempted to point out in our argument on Thursday that this case, by virtue of its unprecedented and unique interpretation of the Robinson-Patman Act, which was not authorized by the text and of the cases as I shall hope to develop in my argument here also, produced a collision and a conflict between the Robinson-Patman Act as construed here by the Federal Trade Commission and the overall policy of the antitrust laws incorporated in the Sherman Act not withstanding the admonitions by this Court to the Federal Trade Commission most recently in the Automatic Canteen case to avoid such collisions and to reconcile the Robinson-Patman Act insofar as the text of that statute permitted with a broader antitrust policies laid down by the Congress in the antitrust laws as a whole.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="457.606" offset="1933772">(Voice Overlap) what do you understand the -- the methods -- policies involved by the Solicitor General here and I would suppose that this is -- the Government tried to -- tried to follow whatever policy Congress had said?</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederick M. Rowe</label>
            <text syncTime="472.493" offset="1993331">That would be my view of the matter, Mr. Justice Black that we are dealing here with the matter of statutory interpretation exclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.901" offset="2023006">But certainly, as the Court's opinion pointed out in the Automatic Canteen case in resolving matters of statutory interpretation, as I would understand the Solicitor's footnote, the policies of the antitrust laws as a whole of which the Robinson-Patman Act is a part should be taken into consideration so that they should be a harmonious whole rather than conflicting parts which at are at odds with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.582" offset="2133661">Before proceeding to the text of the statute as interpreted in the past two decades, I would like to briefly summarized the salient facts which highlight what the issue presented by this case is and perhaps also with the issue presented by this case is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.270" offset="2216417">First, we have here, and it was, I believe, agreed to by Mr. Friedman on Thursday, an honest commercial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.178" offset="2256123">There was no subterfuge or connivance, but rather an open price reduction by the seller to the buyer in circumstances where there were cost economies available to the seller and in circumstances where the seller had to meet competitive offers on pain of losing the sale to the particular buyer here in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.522" offset="2345462">From the seller's viewpoint therefore, the price, which he gave, had the earmarks of legality under the basic provisions of the Robinson-Patman Act because related to cost economies and because related to competitive circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.908" offset="2403035">From the buyer's view point, he merely asked for a lower price because he had equally low price offers available from other sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.773" offset="2442428">There is no evidence in the record or anywhere else of coercion or exaction or any untoward conduct on the buyer's part other than his request to receive a lower price because he simply did not want to pay more to this seller than he had available to him from other sellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.160" offset="2508048">In the case of the broker, the respondent here, his acquiescence in taking a lower rate of commission than he originally had hoped to get from the seller was a perfectly reasonable situation as he saw it because first of all, the seller put it up to him on a take it or leave it basis and so, unless he took the reduced commission, he would have loss the sale and secondly, because this transaction was of an unusual size and dimension which saved him a lot of long distance calls, as he put it on the record, and save him a lot of work, he in effect realized more money for less work from this transaction than others.</text>

            <text syncTime="651.275" offset="2708459">What if a broker or a seller waives or reduces his commission in some sales to some purchasers, but not to others?</text>
            <text syncTime="666.832" offset="2770735">Does that result in the -- and it's passed along, we'll say, the saving by the seller to the customer?</text>
            <text syncTime="677.343" offset="2812740">Is that result in the seller selling on less than substantially equal terms to all?</text>

            <text syncTime="684.610" offset="2841788">It may, Mr. Justice Whittaker, and of course that would be the province of the pricing provisions of the statute, Section 2 (a) governing price quotations by sellers and Section 2 (f) governing the receipts of prices by buyers and if in such a situation this price differentiation could not be justified either by reference to cost economies or by competitive consideration, it might well be held a violation, but of course, in this case, we did have evidence of cost economies and competitive conditions even though the Commission did not proceed against the appropriate parties we feel to this price differentiation and this evidence was rejected by the Commission as immaterial as a matter of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="763.884" offset="3158915">There was no standard price as such because the price of the apple contemplated at issue here had at first been $1.85 per gallon and had then come down to $1.35 per gallon and then $1.30 per gallon, so it wasn't a commodity which had in variable fix price but certainly, it is correct that the seller in this situation received less that he expected to, at the outset, when he authorized price quotations of $1.30.</text>

            <text syncTime="1082.708" offset="4434213">The Commission's unprecedented, as I said, and unique interpretation of 2 (c) for the first time after 23 years or so of the Robinson-Patman Act is based on two premises really, two statutory legal premises, one being that where a seller grants a lower price to a buyer and at the same time, that lower price is coupled with a reduced commission by the seller's broker that in such a situation, a seller is granting a so-called allowance in lieu of brokerage to the buyer even though its price be open which is in violation of Section 2 (c), the brokerage clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.634" offset="4589902">That is the first premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.794" offset="4594500">The second premise of the Commission is that a broker's participation in such a transaction where the seller gives an open lower price and the broker takes a smaller commission that the broker's participation constitutes a so-called indirect payment by the broker to the buyer of an allowance in lieu of brokerage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.689" offset="4678092">The theory being that by accepting a lower rate of commission, the broker in effect gives the money to the seller, who then gives it to the buyer and that is an illegal allowance in lieu of brokerage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.426" offset="4725112">Now, as to that first premise that the seller's conduct in giving the lower price openly to the buyer is an allowance in lieu of brokerage, we believe that this assertion is contrary to the basic premise of this Court's opinion and the Simplicity Pattern case, only last June, is contrary to a ruling by the First Circuit Court of Appeals, only last month in the Robinson case and is contrary to the congressional objective in Section 2 (c) as detailed fully and amply in the legislative history which we have included as an appendix to our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1192.247" offset="4872338">In the Robinson case, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, a seller had first employed a broker to find sales outlets for him to a certain customer who bought paper cups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.802" offset="4922598">After a while, the seller realized that he would prefer to do business directly with these buyers and so he let the broker go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.995" offset="4955303">After he left the broker go, he reflected the savings and the broker's commission in a lower price to the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.355" offset="4980799">Thereupon, the broker brought suit against both the seller, in one case and against the buyer, in the other case, charging that the seller's lower price which reflected the savings and broker's commissions was a so-called allowance in lieu of brokerage in violation of Section 2 (c) of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.643" offset="5053942">In other words, precisely, the first premise of the Commission's legal theory here, as it has spelled it out on page 26 of its brief, page 27 which says, “If a seller dispensed with his broker services in making a particular sale and then openly reduce to selling price by the exact amount of brokerage involved, this would constitute an allowance in lieu of brokerage by the seller to the buyer in violation of Section 2 (c).”</text>

            <text syncTime="1284.571" offset="5241605">It might make a difference insofar as the seller might or might not be discriminating and insofar as the Commission then proceeded against the seller, it might certainly plead that there was discrimination, but insofar as the Commission has taken the position that regardless of the situation as between one buyer or another buyer whenever a seller reflects in his lower price brokerage fee savings, there is an allowance in lieu of brokerage which is the Commission's position as expressed in its brief here, then we believe the Robinson decision is directly to the contrary because it says, as we say that whenever there is a lower price, such as we have here, the Commission cannot simply convert it into allowance in lieu of brokerage which is illegal per se particularly when that lower price is competitively motivated, as we have indicated in the record here, and as responsive to cost economies of the kind, which Congress time after time said in the legislative history, it wished to preserve for the consumer in the form of lower prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.755" offset="5490395">And as we point it out of course, also, the Commission takes the position here that there cannot be a cost justification available to the seller in such a situation even though Congress expressly, in 1936, rejected the proposal that the cost justification should not be permitted to include economies and brokers commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.959" offset="5583182">The Simplicity Patterns case which the -- which we believe really spells out the basic design of the statute in the context of which this case occurs, that opinion stressed and emphasized the fundamental distinction in the statute between the open prices, the open prices which were treated by Congress as being lawful depending on whether they were injurious to competition or whether they could be cost justified or whether they could be justified by competitive responses, that was one fundamental premise of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.804" offset="5734588">The other thing that Congress provided for in the statute was certain and to use this Court's words false and concealed transactions which were automatically unlawful regardless of competitive consequences, regardless of cost justifications and among those concealed transactions, which the Court's opinion in the Simplicity case, pointed out were, “secret brokerage payments” and “false brokerage payments”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.469" offset="5845243">The purpose of that distinction made by Congress in the Robinson-Patman Act and as pointed in its legislative history also was by making this prohibition on the secret and concealed transactions absolute and unqualified to thereby drive prices out into the open with the aim, and again to quote the opinion's language, “with the aim of bringing these prices out into the open so that they could be measured and so that they could be compared with possible cost economies.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.215" offset="5980244">In this situation, in the case at bar, we have precisely such a lower open price reduction forced out into the open in effect which could be compared on the record with cost economies available to the seller and which could be compared with the competitive situation rather than being concealed -- concealed transactions or rather than being arrived at by any kind of connivance or subterfuge as the Commission does not contest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.418" offset="6097063">And nevertheless, the Commission has taken the position that this open price transaction is an allowance in lieu of brokerage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.731" offset="6130291">We feel this interpretation is directly contrary to the purpose of Congress in enacting Section 2 (c) of the statute as expressed in the Congressional Reports, which we have quoted in excerpt in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.473" offset="6185253">For example, the Report of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on page 22 of our brief, states that the purpose of Section 2 (c) of the statute, the so-called brokerage clause was to bar “the practice of certain large buyers to demand the allowance of brokerage direct to them upon their purchases or its payments to an employee, agent or corporate subsidiary, whom they set up in the guise of a broker and through whom they demand that sales to them be made.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.500" offset="6321403">And I may say that the legislative history repeatedly and consistently reflects the tenure that secrecy, connivance, concealment and subterfuge whether vices of which the brokerage clause were directed because it was an absolute prohibition whereas the basic provision of the statute, governing price dependant on competitive injuries, competitive showings and permitted the justification of a lower price by the seller so that the economies of efficient distribution would not be denied to the customer and ultimately to the American consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.752" offset="6466330">As I pointed out, the Commission's elimination of the cost justification in an open price situation of this time is contrary to the action of the Senate House Conference Committee which, in 1936, deleted and struck out this precise proposal when it was advanced by some of the proponents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.792" offset="6546578">And as a matter of fact, Senator Logan who was the Senate manager of the legislation and who was the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee in charge of the legislation pointed out that this was one of these fantastic ideas by which someone had tried to discredit the legislation, namely, to suggest that a seller could not lower his price so as to reflect cost economies predicated on brokerage savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.191" offset="6660159">The meaning and the intention of Congress in this particular provision was illustrated, we believe, quite clearly by the A &amp; P case which was before the Courts in the 1930s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.227" offset="6708328">This case, one of the landmark applications of the Robinson-Patman Act, was addressed against A &amp; P which previous to the enactment of the statute had secured, coerced rebates and exacted secret -- secret brokerage commissions by the device of setting up so-called field buying agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.398" offset="6788995">A &amp; P set up these field buying agents who collected brokers commissions from sellers, masquerading as independent businessman and after they had collected these rebates, they kicked them back and passed them over back to the A &amp; P which thereby was able to collect discriminatory price favors which were concealed from you and which were hidden and could not be detected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.698" offset="6882200">And it was this type of thing which Congress was aiming against in passing this provision shortly after the Robinson-Patman Act, the A &amp; P converted this field buying deal whereby these field buying agents collected rebates and it told these field buyers to go out and negotiate with the seller to convert the previous rebate payment and to compute a false price based on the exact amount of the rebate and reflecting that amount of the rebate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2192.822" offset="8874611">If I may proceed quickly to the second premise, the derivative premise of the Commission's theory here, namely, that a broker who participates in an open price reduction from a seller to the buyer is guilty of paying a so-called indirect allowance in lieu of brokerage by accepting a lower commission via the seller's retention of the balance by way of the seller's lower price to the buyer is guilty of a so-called indirect payment in Section 2 (c) of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.671" offset="9002088">First, I believe the Commission has recognized that the text of Section 2 (c) provides that a person may not pay a brokerage commission to the buyer or to the buyer's intermediary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.238" offset="9056319">It says “A person may not pay to the other party.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.947" offset="9075127">As I understood the Commission's argument, it took the position that the broker was in fact a party and so, a payment by the broker was a payment in violation of Section 2 (c), but once again, it is clear from the Committee Reports, which we have excerpted in our brief, that Congress was not legislating against payments by brokers, it was rather legislating against payments by sellers to buyers and by sellers to the false fronts and intermediaries of buyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.766" offset="9186408">The statutory prohibition does run as we pointed out in our briefs against a broker receiving from the seller a commission which he then turns over or kicks back to the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.811" offset="9230608">There is no question about that, and there is no controversy between us and the Commissioner on that account, but there simply is not in Section 2 (c) as it is now written a provision saying that apart from this receipt of illegal brokerage which would make a kickback unlawful, apart from that, there is a further prohibition on so-called payments by brokers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.532" offset="9313468">And in any event, the only payment that there is in this case that there is alleged to be in this case is this acceptance by the broker of a lower rate of commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.793" offset="9358503">There was no money changing hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.590" offset="9365713">There was no passing over or rebating or kickbacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.664" offset="9382013">All the broker here did was to accept when the seller told him, “Take or leave it, 3%,” he accepted 3% and this is the theory of indirect payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.520" offset="9417435">We think it's very significant in this connection that the examiner's initial decision for the Federal Trade Commission in this case, very candidly, we think, put it that what the Commission was doing in predicating liability against the broker here was to filling a -- an omission what it thought was an omission in the text of the statute as passed by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2463.726" offset="9958275">I would also, in this connection, not neglect to point out that Senator Logan once again, who was the Senate manager of the bill, pointed out to the Senate that there was no prohibition in the statute against deduction of legitimate brokerage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.406" offset="10025044">There was nothing again -- in the statute against the payment or deduction of legitimate brokerage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.114" offset="10043852">It was rather sham brokerage and dummy brokerage with which the statute was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.793" offset="10066526">Finally and basically, we feel that the Commission's theory of this case of this unique interpretation of the statute, 23 years after its enactment, has the necessary and inevitable effect of preventing the reduction of brokerage commissions in competitive situations and as a necessary consequence, we feel, of stabilizing and maintaining the level of brokerage fees at unnatural levels to the detriment of the American consumer because what the Commission does here in effect is to foster the very type of stabilization of commissions which the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice as indicated in the Real Estate Board case has consistently pursued as unlawful restrain of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.756" offset="10266415">We feel basically that the antitrust laws to quote the classic phrase of Mr. Chief Justice Hughes are -- “our charter of economic freedom comfortable to constitutional provisions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.877" offset="10318869">For this reason, this Court has never lightly presumed departures and exemptions to the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.773" offset="10342484">Most recently in this Court's opinion in the McKesson and Robinson case involving resale price maintenance, a so-called principle of fair trade, this Court's opinion pointed out that resale price fixing is a privilege restrictive of a free economy and must be narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.702" offset="10410193">We feel in this particular situation, the danger to the policy of antitrust and to the principle of competition is graver because it is more insidious in the field of resale price maintenance, the clash between the price fixing and the antitrust policy is manifest, it is open.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.604" offset="10477798">What we have here is unprecedented and we submit an untenable interpretation of the Robinson-Patman Act by the Federal Trade Commission which would in fact stifle competition in the name of protecting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.100" offset="10527744">We feel that this Court should not permit such a perversion of antitrust.</text>
