            <text syncTime="20.670" offset="186075">This case comes here on certiorari to the Seventh Circuit which had issued a writ of mandamus to petitioner directing him to send back to Dallas, Texas a patent infringement case which had been begun there and which had been transferred to the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.260" offset="280430">The facts on the case are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.054" offset="295581">The plaintiffs were all Illinois residents or corporations having their place of business in and around Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.837" offset="326719">The two defendants, Mr. Howell and Lifetime Metal Buildings, were both residents of Texas and have their only place of business in and around Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.093" offset="383770">After the case had been begun in 1957 in Dallas, the defendants moved to transfer the case to Illinois because of the pendency of another patent, in fact, two other patent infringement cases which had been pending in Illinois for some time and in which a great deal of pretrial discovery had been had.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.076" offset="471646">The Court granted the motion to transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.752" offset="486379">The plaintiffs in Texas took -- asked for a writ of mandamus to the District Judge in Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.885" offset="518875">They were -- that writ was denied in Ex parte Blaski in 245 F.2d 737.</text>

            <text syncTime="121.855" offset="590764">Upon the denial of the writ for the Fifth Circuit, the jurist -- the so called jurisdictional point was raised?</text>

            <text syncTime="130.395" offset="624933">There was no -- there's no point of discretion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.612" offset="633814">It's entirely a matter of jurisdiction and it was raised in the Fifth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.268" offset="668400">Raised and adjudicated in -- by the -- by the Court of Appeals in the Fifth Circuit?</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_j_merriam" startTime="144.654" stopTime="314.771">
            <label>Mr. Charles J. Merriam</label>
            <text syncTime="144.654" offset="681984">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.358" offset="692851">When the case came back to -- came to the Northern District of Illinois, it was assigned to Judge Hoffman and the plaintiffs moved to send it back to Texas on the ground that the Illinois Court had no power to receive it or the Texas Court had no power to send it.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.080" offset="767666">And Judge Hoffman, the petitioner denied the motion whereupon a writ of mandamus was sought from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and was denied on July 1, 1958, whereupon a petition for rehearing was filed and granted on October 16th, 1958 without reargument.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.592" offset="861706">A petition was then filed by Judge Hoffman asking that the Court reconsider the whole matter en banc in view of the fact that it was contrary to the decision, in this case, was contrary to two other cases of the Seventh Circuit and contrary to the decisions in four other circuits including the Blaski case to which I have just referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.598" offset="965778">That petition -- that request for a rehearing was denied for the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.881" offset="986885">Incidentally, the reversal of the mandamus was two to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.195" offset="1000155">This was for the two and the petition to this Court was properly taken and granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.678" offset="1030040">And there are, as Your Honors know, two other cases which follow this, one from the Seventh Circuit and one from the Fifth on the same point which involves the construction of Section 1404 (a) of the Title 28 Judicial Code which reads, “For the convenience of parties and witnesses in the interest of justice, a District Court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.”</text>
            <text syncTime="264.392" offset="1160965">And those last six words are the ones which have caused all of the controversy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.183" offset="1184057">Because of the time the case was transferred from Texas to Illinois, there was no indication that except for the waiver which was made in the motion to transfer that either Mr. Howell or Lifetime Metal Buildings could have been served in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.954" offset="1259186">They have not -- they have no place of business there, they were not resident there and they had not committed an act of infringement there.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.883" offset="1286875">No charge, there was of no point that I make to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.870" offset="1302862">The question therefore was, did the waiver which was accompanied -- which accompanied the motion to transfer, as a matter of law bring the situation within the 1404 (a).</text>

            <text syncTime="322.423" offset="1393037">I noticed that you -- as far as your brief is concerned of merely raising the direct question of 1404 and all these were -- and all these came here in a -- in a situation where the case was transferred without a need of the history involved in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="386.505" offset="1649351">Judge Hoffman said it was not sufficiently dignified but if we had not come here before this Court, this case would have orbited between Dallas and Chicago because the Fifth Circuit was under a final order to send it to Illinois and the clerk in Chicago was under a final order to send it to Dallas and it would have presented a situation which to us seems not in good consonance with the way courts had to act and therefore, up to be adjudicated in some way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.121" offset="4367862">The suit was one for the construction of a contract of automobile insurance, and while the accident had occurred in the State of Oklahoma, I see no reason to assume and the Court certainly didn't go on this ground that that case could have been brought in Oklahoma against two Wisconsin residents via Washington Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.400" offset="4448946">Now, with those two cases in the books, ours came up and they say that it first decided one way and then two to one the other way and then four to two petition en banc was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.870" offset="4514879">It's petitioners position here that it isn't necessary for us or don't hesitate if asked to say exactly what language in the statute should be construed and exactly what way to serve the purpose of the First, Second, Third, and Fifth Circuits and of the two earlier decisions of the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.649" offset="4646013">And -- but that the statute was passed as a remedial statute due to the situation that resulted from Gulf Oil against Gilbert and -- but under that situation, the rule of statutory construction is that a statute which is intended as a remedy should be broadly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.880" offset="4758862">There's no doubt that the act is ambiguous as to where it might have been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.989" offset="4787284">There is no statement as to whether that means where it might then had been brought that is in on the day that the suit was filed or whether it is of some subsequent time such as the time the motion to transfer is granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.113" offset="4843813">If you go to the forum non conveniens cases as Mr. Butler has in the case which follows and he has gone into it at great length and I don't want to deprive him of the opportunity of presenting that in the first distance, in the forum non conveniens cases, it never was a rule that the two forums which were prerequisite to the doctrine -- to the doctrine had to be available on the day the suit was filed and that seems to make good sense because I would think it was rather rare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.791" offset="4994487">But in the first place, justice would seem to indicate otherwise but I think it's quite rare that a plaintiff who is filing a suit can be absolutely certain on the day he files it whether he's going to get good service on the defendant or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.491" offset="5053315">And if we start using his subjective test to that nature, what happens, do we investigate to see whether at the day that suit was started in Texas, the Texas people happened to be in Europe and therefore, it couldn't have been served there until a month later?</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.736" offset="5114337">I don't think we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.387" offset="5128965">And therefore I think that an -- an objective point of view which promotes justice is to be preferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.878" offset="5162924">But the cases which have found in the way which petitioner found have not gone in to detail reasoning for the -- for basis for their findings that begs in the Rodney case made a great many suggestions as to how the statute might be interpreted, how the language which is -- might be brought and that could be brought, indicates permission, brings out the dramatical basis for where it might have been brought as to whether it means in the day the complaint was filed or sometime later but he does not try to pin it down anymore than we are trying to pin it down here as to the exact words which should be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.729" offset="5350275">As matter of fact, the only court that I know of that has held the Act unambiguous is the Seventh Circuit, two to one in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1432.620" offset="5833853">And while his language might be interpreted one way as against the other, the decision in the case is not in anyway contrary to this and of course it was ahead of the Kaufman case and the Torres against Walsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.736" offset="5890278">Now, they also cite as contrary to the situation the -- this early case in the -- in the Fifth Circuit which is cited by in the Blaski opinion in that Court which appears at page 9 of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.027" offset="5967496">And on page 11, the Court discusses Blackmar against Guerre in -- which was in 190 F.2d 427 as being contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.234" offset="6028309">And that case did deny the transfer but it did not go into the matter of waiver of venue and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals says this did not go into it and this is not contrary authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.445" offset="6077106">So I don't -- I don't consider as contrary authority and -- I know no -- no Circuit Court as such except these two decisions in the Seventh Circuit that have taken the other position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.064" offset="6139591">Now, in the meantime while the -- the chronology here is somewhat interesting because the Rodney case was decided in January of 1951, January 5th I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.657" offset="6194030">The Kaufman case was paneled, what was decided later in that same year, the Josephson case in 1954, the Torres case in 1955 and the Blaski case I forget whether it's 1957 or 1958 on the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.297" offset="6264560">During that time, the -- a member of the Judicial Code and particularly the venue sections, were under consideration by the judicial conference and that is summarized and referred to in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.389" offset="6332897">In the report number 1706 of the House of Representatives, 85th Congress Second Session and the document is extremely interesting and showing just what it was it was before the judicial conference, the length of time it was before the judicial conference and what they decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.064" offset="6439581">Now, the -- on page 13 of the document, there's a footnote and I'll read the footnote, it's not long and it's not quoted in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.485" offset="6501334">“Chief Judge Parker presented a resolution of the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit with respect to legislating, proposing to establish restrictions upon the existing statutory power of the District Courts in the transfer of civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.902" offset="6559013">It was the opinion of Judge Parker as well as that of the Judicial Counsel of the Fourth Circuit, but because of the numerous legislative proposal which had -- recently been introduced affecting the venue on jurisdiction of the courts, it was advisable to have a committee of the conference created for the purpose of considering the entire question of venue and jurisdiction of the courts and that was done and the report was submitted not only to all of the circuits but there was -- it's pointed out on page 27 of the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.504" offset="6697357">A special conference was held in each of the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eight and Tenth Circuits concerning the entire subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.950" offset="6739153">And the conclusion was that no change of the nature proposed to be made in Section 1404 of the Judicial Code be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.897" offset="6778964">Now, it's true, I don't want to mislead anybody that the change that was under some -- the specific change under consideration was that, to cut down the right to transfer in all cases where the venue was controlled by a separate act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.391" offset="6848972">However, the Court could not have during that time with members from the various circuits which had -- were passing on this subject has failed to consider also the question of whether or not the act should be narrowed or to eliminate the problem that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.318" offset="6932668">And I cited in my brief the NLRB versus Gullett Gin Company case, 340 U.S. 361 in this case -- court, State of Missouri against Ross at 299 U.S. 72 and 75.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.622" offset="7005811">Both of which held that where an act in one case, as the Bankruptcy Act has been on -- analogous of the National Labor Relations Board Act had been under consideration by Congress during a period while decisions were being handed down adopting a particular construction that the Court should not go counter to that construction which the courts have found during that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.079" offset="7127646">Now, actually, the document from which I read a moment ago, the report of the 85th Congress was not put out until 1957 I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.959" offset="7175189">And during all of that time, the cases had been unanimous toward the position which petitioner seeks here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.274" offset="7368495">The only place that an act can be brought -- action can be brought in the federal court of either the residence of the plaintiff or the residence of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.734" offset="7410291">If it's brought on one of those places -- well, if it's brought on that residence of the defendant, he has many place to transfer it to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.328" offset="7444668">Unless he happens to be spending most of his time in the residence of the plaintiff and that's highly unlikely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.291" offset="7476537">Therefore, there's practically no chance to transfer a diversity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.637" offset="7493883">I think the thing -- the same thing is true of -- of a patent infringement case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.155" offset="7516035">Now, there is one way around this which is not been pointed out on the briefs, it might change this point and that is that it could be decided that if a declaratory judgment suit could be maintained on the same issues in the place to which transfer was made that then it could have been brought there on the day the action was filed, and therefore, the action not in posture which it was presented but on the same issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.248" offset="7632332">Now, that might be a distinction that would overcome a part of my problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.829" offset="7650722">But we have here a case in which it is conceded at least to the purposes of this Court by our opponents that justice is -- the interest of justice is required, requires that this case be transferred to Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.125" offset="7723865">Now, why should that interest of justice be denied upon a technicality?</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.704" offset="7754167">The court below said that if our position was followed that a case could be transferred to any court in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.026" offset="7807457">And it seems to petitioner that that ignores the fact that the act says that it can only be transferred where the interest of the parties, the convenience of the parties or the witnesses or the interest of justice require.</text>

            <text syncTime="3445.165" offset="13884061">Mr. Chief Justice, in answer to your inquiry a moment ago of Mr. Merriam as to whether or not the respondents disagree with the idea that the interpretation of Mr. Merriam is asking for with respect to the statute, whether we agree to that would be in the interest of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.586" offset="13989700">In the narrow sense, we -- we aren't quarreling with the convenience of parties and interest of justice in the sense of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.860" offset="14022823">That is now involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.029" offset="14027525">It's strictly here, a question of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.058" offset="14039646">We haven't appealed from the District Courts' finding in Texas as to the convenience of parties and that we don't agree with them but that isn't -- doesn't have any element here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.709" offset="14094190">All -- our question is here is whether the Court have the power to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.272" offset="14112475">Now, if you are asking -- if the question was, “Do we agree that in general it would be an interest of justice?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.443" offset="14137135">Our answer is emphatically no and we think it would be great injustice and that -- that it would be giving a defendant a power which neither party ever had before and it would be giving a defendant power that a plaintiff doesn't have now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.997" offset="14191365">A defendant could then transfer the case into any district in the 50 states, merely on the finding of a district judge that would be for the inconvenience of parties on the defendants own motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.078" offset="14247685">The plaintiff doesn't have -- doesn't have that power.</text>

            <text syncTime="5553.125" offset="22315865">So, actually, that case is very, very analogous to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5556.612" offset="22329866">The -- and -- the only difference in that instance, you had a California executor involved as -- on the plaintiff's side, the defendants moved to transfer it to Texas and they waived venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5569.441" offset="22381171">And the defendant's argument was that well, the executor could've brought it down in Texas and if we haven't objected to it, he -- he could have gone again with the -- with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5580.377" offset="22424848">We are waiving our objection and therefore, it should be tried there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5587.009" offset="22451388">But the court refused it and in doing so, he pointed out that this was a question of power and that Section 1404 (a) didn't give that power and it specifically held “the phrase might have been brought,” means the place for the plaintiff have the right to institute a suit originally.</text>

            <text syncTime="5612.215" offset="22552221">Orginially, Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5615.229" offset="22564237">Even the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in its decision in the Blaski case and this case admits that these five district court cases referred to in our brief and then in five -- I mean in the five circuits support the respondent's position in this case and refers to them -- itself -- at page 11 of the transcript of the record that appears in their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5642.213" offset="22672175">And another of the District Court decisions supporting the respondents here is the decision of then Judge Whittaker, now, Justice -- Mr. Justice Whittaker of this Court in the General Electric Company versus Transit Warehouse Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5657.415" offset="22732988">And in that case, Judge Whittaker in a very carefully reason, the logical opinion discussed at some length, the words “where it might have been brought” in Section 1404 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="5668.623" offset="22777814">And in ruling on a motion of defendant for change of venue and in that case, he granted the motion because the plaintiffs had pleaded in their complaint residents of the -- of the defendant in the transferee district.</text>
            <text syncTime="5684.181" offset="22840090">But in that case, Judge Whittaker carefully pointed out that -- that no meaning is left to the words “where it might have been brought” if this section is interpreted to require a trans -- a transferee district unless it's interpreted to require a transferee district in which statutory venue exist and service of process and involuntary personal jurisdiction could be acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="5717.189" offset="22972165">Judge Whittaker, now Justice Whittaker, in that case also agreed with the dissenting members in the Paramount Pictures versus Rodney case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5730.613" offset="23025873">And Judge Hoffman, the petitioner in this instance, in his opinion in this case, also stated that he personally -- he agreed and I'd like to read from his opinion, the closing part -- toward the closing under his opinion there which appears at page 25 of the transcript of record where he stated, “Gentlemen, personally, I am of the opinion that the dissent in Paramount against Rodney is supported by the greater weight of reasons and logic and that this Court, if I were to rely upon my own personal information should retransfer this case to Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5770.744" offset="23186369">Those cases supporting transfer of this district, I think do great violence to the established rules of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5778.950" offset="23219179">They seem to create a doctrine of retroactive waiver in order to reach the conclusion that the action might have been brought.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5787.088" offset="23251675">Now, after making that strong statement, Judge Hoffman, the petitioner in this case then proceeded to rule to the contrary on and put it on the basis of these other Court of Appeals cases which we've stated -- which in our opinion can be distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="5805.698" offset="23326177">And also, he stated that he -- he felt that he should follow the law as it appear to be established and I quote, “Especially in view of the fact that the Supreme Court has consistently refused to grant certiorari in those cases supporting transfer to this district.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5823.137" offset="23395871">Well, of course, we submit that Judge Hoffman clearly was in error in giving any weight whatsoever to the fact that certiorari was denied by -- by this Court that he was given in any -- that he was in error in giving any weight to that whatsoever either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5847.164" offset="23492002">Mr. Justice Frankfurter, earlier, you asked with respect to question of whether mandamus was a proper action here and at page 35 of the transcript, the Court or Appeals stated, “No question is raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="5875.978" offset="23607254">In fact, all parties concede that under Section 1651 mandamus is appropriate means for testing the legality of the order in controversy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5884.127" offset="23639855">Further, our jurisdiction if there be any doubt is supported by the decision of this Court in the Chicago Rock Island versus (Inauidble).</text>
            <text syncTime="5893.115" offset="23675800">And with respect to the question of -- of res judicata or comity, the petitioner himself admits that -- at page 16 of the transcript of the record, he says, “I am of the opinion that this Court may -- may so inquire that's into the jurisdiction of transferring and accept jurisdiction and that the doctrine res judicata on the law of the case raise no barrier to such an inquiry.”</text>
