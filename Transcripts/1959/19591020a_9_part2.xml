            <text syncTime="75.151" offset="403937">That I could not answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.417" offset="409057">I know there are others in addition to ours, but I don't know how many there are.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.312" offset="424626">I would not be in the position to state that.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.369" offset="432880">The matter was discussed at the recent convention of NIMLO which the National Institute of Municipal Law Officers which just took place last week and I might state this was the major problem with which we were all concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.873" offset="478856">And I know that there are the cities that had such an ordinance, it was discovered there, but I couldn't say specifically how many do, or how many do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.176" offset="524100">As an indication of the broad field to which this thing -- this has been applied, this principle that you do not need to have specific knowledge is the case of Williams versus North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.544" offset="569553">That involved a -- the validity of a divorce and a bigamy prosecution and in that case, the Court stated “A man's faith often depends as for instance in the enforcement of the Sherman law on far greater risks that he will estimate rightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.177" offset="636113">That is, as the jury subsequently estimates it to some matter of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.262" offset="656384">If his judgment is wrong, not only may he incur a fine or a short imprisonment as here, he may incur the punishment of death.”</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="146.035" offset="687522">Now that would be -- that language will be quite relevant if here -- they were showing that Mr. Smith knew the contents of the book and then went ahead and took his chances on a prosecution after knowing it, but is that relevant to the man who doesn't know what's inside the covers of the book?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roger_arnebergh" startTime="163.677" stopTime="311.277">
            <label>Mr. Roger Arnebergh</label>
            <text syncTime="163.677" offset="758053">I think it is relevant in this respect that it shows that absent – it shows that there is one step along the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.541" offset="793579">It shows that guilty knowledge is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.907" offset="802983">Now, in answer to your specific question, you have a directly analogous situation in connection with your Pure Food and Drug Act and things of that nature and in the case of Dotterweich for example 320 U.S. 277, it was specifically held there that an officer of the corporation who had been convicted, that conviction could be sustained although he had no personal knowledge of the matter at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.719" offset="902248">In that case, this Court stated “The now familiar type of legislation whereby penalty served as effective means of regulation such legislation dispenses with the conventional requirement of criminal conduct, awareness of wrong doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.405" offset="960972">In the instance of the larger good, it puts the burden of acting as hazard upon a person otherwise innocent, but standing in a responsible relationship to the buyer or to the public danger, pardon me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="228.483" offset="1017292">Now, my contention is -- our contention is that here, you have a person who stands in a responsible relationship to a public danger that of the indiscriminate distribution of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.183" offset="1072149">And the same principle is of course then applied to short wake and to numerous other matters such as billing and safety, zoning and things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.404" offset="1109034">The principle that guilty knowledge is not a necessary element in a -- to hold a person criminally liable for a violation of law, has been sustained in cases involving constitutional rights in addition to those of the Fourteen Amendment which of course protected, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.308" offset="1176639">For example, the first right mentioned in the First Amendment to the Constitution is that of a freedom of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.398" offset="1204955">But yet in the Reynolds case, here a conviction of bigamy was sustained despite the fact that the defense was that he thought he was doing right, and it was one of the principles of his religion and with respect to the Second Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.347" offset="1264724">The Second Amendment provides that the person's right to carry and to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.335" offset="1292727">Yet, we have laws with respect to carrying concealed weapons or even possession of certain types of weapons such as machine guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.856" offset="1326791">He may have no knowledge of the law, but he's guilty nevertheless.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.434" offset="1385096">Well, it is a question of him having knowledge that the thing that he sold was in violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.485" offset="1429295">In other words, he knows that he sold a book.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.865" offset="1438804">He had a book and he knows that he sold the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.061" offset="1447581">Now, the question that comes up, do we have the right to require him to know what he is selling, or can he sell anything that he wants indiscriminately on the basis he didn't know what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.645" offset="1493974">That is the question.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roger Arnebergh</label>
            <text syncTime="369.087" offset="1579760">The ordinance does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.433" offset="1593135">In other words, this presents the question referring to -- to food and drug as the closest analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.678" offset="1618108">Is it more important for society to protect the well-being, of the physical well-being of its members or the mental well-being of its members or as Bishop Fulton Sheen recently expressed it, “Why should we not keep poison away from minds as we keep it away from stomachs?”</text>
            <text syncTime="397.120" offset="1691878">On considering this question it's important to recognize that probably 50% or more of our mental -- our hospitals are now occupied by cases from mental disturbances to some kind or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.274" offset="1740466">And believe me it's far easier to pump poison from the stomach than poison from a mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.049" offset="1767528">Obscenity may affect the hearts and minds in a way never to be undone.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.234" offset="1788322">Unfortunately, by the case of Brown versus Board of Education of Topeka, it has now been clearly established that that which affects the hearts and minds of its people is just as much a matter of concern to the State as that which affects their bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.297" offset="1860524">Now, of course the problem presented in this case far transcends the importance of the evil that that particular book might do.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.131" offset="1891871">The defendant here as in all similar cases, contends that he doesn't know what he sells.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.040" offset="1915486">That he doesn't read the books that he handles, that his business is so big that he couldn't possibly read all of the books that he sells.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.428" offset="1953102">Is bigness a defense?</text>
            <text syncTime="466.142" offset="1967940">If we had to prove that the defendant knew that the book that he sold was obscene then he would be setting the standard, not the community, not the average person.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.716" offset="2022275">To be the law that bigness is a defense, that he doesn't have to read, he doesn't -- if he hasn't read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.941" offset="2047143">He doesn't know what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.877" offset="2050905">He's not liable?</text>
            <text syncTime="488.120" offset="2055816">Then the bigger the dealer, the less responsible that you would have, while a small dealer, could probably be reasonably required to have read the three or four books that he might handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.590" offset="2101687">If this be the -- if this be the defense, then the very same defense would be available to every large dealer regardless of how vile, how contaminated, how filthy the material that he would handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.393" offset="2148916">I can not believe that it is the law that bigness, mere bigness is a defense because it prohibits -- so -- his business is so large that the man can't know what he's doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.501" offset="2189354">He has to have the responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.458" offset="2197191">These same arguments were made at the beginning of the Pure Food and Drug Act and it was said that nobody would dare to handle Pure Food but we still have -- we still have foods stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.013" offset="2243375">The only difference is that now, the food that they sell is pure.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.699" offset="2266154">Now, free speech has been very much discussed in this case, but does an ordinance which makes it illegal for a bookseller to possess or sell an obscene book really involve free speech?</text>
            <text syncTime="554.741" offset="2322369">The quick answer of course is that obscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected speech of the press, but the importance of the overall problem is such that I don't think we should stop here.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.522" offset="2381511">The commercial exploitation of the morbid and shameful craving for materials with prurient effect requires that we go beyond this.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.612" offset="2417768">And in studying the various cases dealing with free speech and the difference -- different opinions, I've tried awfully hard to try to reconcile what is the underlying cause of it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.323" offset="2468655">The nebulous principle of law that would reconcile them all them together because I'm sure all the decisions, all the different opinions are striving for the same thing that we're striving for, that of protecting free speech without licensing obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.087" offset="2535737">And I'm unwilling to accept the premise that this cannot be done, that there is necessarily any inherent conflict between our objectives of preserving free speech, and preventing commercial exploitation of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.616" offset="2597804">So I really put -- so I went back and did a lot of reviewing even since our brief was written, we are then so close to the case that we probably didn't look at the cause for the trees and this -- and in this connection --</text>

            <text syncTime="804.123" offset="3319829">From the very beginning, the cases have involved the speech of the defendant who was attempting to personally organize or personally carry a banner or personally picket.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.906" offset="3371029">For example, Herndon versus Lowry, that involved this personal speech of the defendant who was attempting to organize.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.388" offset="3404884">Watkins versus United States involved the right of the defendant to, with respect to his taking an oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.960" offset="3431215">Sweezy versus New Hampshire involved the right of the defendant to personally refuse to answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.865" offset="3454830">Hague versus Committee for Industrial Welfare involved the right to have an injunction to prohibit the plaintiff -- the plaintiff in the injunction case Hague, the injunction to restrain him from exercising his personal rights to distribute handbills setting forth his personal views and Helvering versus Leonard, involved in anti-picketing ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.976" offset="3543228">Defendant was personally picketing and he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.569" offset="3557648">In Carlson versus State of California involved an ordinance prohibiting display of banners by pickets and the defendant was personally picketing and personally carrying a banner.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.594" offset="3601742">In Bridges versus California, a contempt case, involved a letter or telegram that Bridges had personally sent.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.574" offset="3633716">And the Times Mirror, the other defendant, involved an editorial personally put in their paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.989" offset="3663287">Now, there's too a great distinction between the exercise of free speech and engaging in commercial activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.854" offset="3694738">Schneider versus Irvington involved the right of the defendant to personally distribute handbills in the street.</text>

            <text syncTime="1028.252" offset="4216351">As I started to say about this case in New York, they prohibited the distribution of handbills and the Court stated that they couldn't do this but they clearly recognized the distinction stating, “We are not to be taken as holding that commercial soliciting and canvassing may not be subjected to such regulations as the ordinance may require.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.745" offset="4302346">It was the prohibiting of passing out handbills setting forth a person's personal views that was unconstitutional and there're been many distinctions between the commercial activity and this free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.494" offset="4365354">That's stressed in -- now in the Valentine case but -- and these various other cases, Packer Corporation versus Utah, Fifth Avenue Coach Company where they prohibited display advertising on the side of buses and all of its stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.866" offset="4438810">From this -- from these cases, it would be seen that it is the personal right of defendant to personally exercise his free speech that is protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.952" offset="4491160">Further it is clear that free speech is distinguishable from commercial activity and this is the key to the whole solution, as our problem is not with those who wish to personally express their ideas, their views or their opinions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2756.404" offset="11128978">First of all, the average person never buys all of the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.390" offset="11144965">I mean you talk about the sale of a million books, well how million people are there in the country?</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.239" offset="11164296">It's a very small percentage, a small fraction of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.981" offset="11179342">So that's no proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.156" offset="11188015">The fact that books of an obscene nature or suggestive or so on, that this particular book sold and it had some passages in it that were not delicately expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.521" offset="11237439">Then applying contemporary community standards, well again, I don't think we'd go out looking for trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.820" offset="11274637">It's when we receive a flood of protests from organizations of people who are concerned about the community standards and they are the ones who set the community standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.055" offset="11323643">That we go out, we send an officer and he checks up and finds these books and of course, if we get back to the average person remember this, we have a problem there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.335" offset="11368678">If we will look at the people who are most familiar with the average person, we will go to the advertisers who spend billions of dollars a year in advertising and their advertising is designed for a 14-year-old mentality on -- over and large.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.884" offset="11438895">So we must be careful who we consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.619" offset="11453837">I don't consider that a person who has a broad experience and the wealth of education and the higher intellect that is represented by the Justice in this Court are necessarily the average person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.550" offset="11529592">Now the dominant theme of material, I don't know how many of you have read the book if you have read it, I feel sorry for you for having had to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.261" offset="11564387">It is just a series of sexual acts of various types linked together with nothing, but connecting sentences in my opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2883.023" offset="11635440">Well, again, I say we're all aware of the power of advertising and the effective constant repetition and you have that here and then it was mentioned that this had an important idea to convey or probably the important idea that it conveyed was best illustrated from a quote from it and well I won't read the quote.</text>

            <text syncTime="3354.256" offset="13520436">Thank you, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.109" offset="13527855">I would like to address myself merely to one point that I think has been stated so much that it needs a little clarification and that is the difference between the commercial exploitation of filth that Mr. Arnebergh has described it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.596" offset="13589713">If this Court was talking about in Roth-Alberts and the attempt to equate it with what's going on here, here there was no pushing of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.101" offset="13635793">If Mr. Smith was commercially exploiting anything, then every person who went to the drugstore and has any books and magazines there is equally commercially exploiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.422" offset="13681037">Every market that has paper bound books is equally commercially exploiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.021" offset="13703502">These are easy words that give it a meaning that doesn't apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.583" offset="13725654">What Mr. Smith had was a bookstore and he had a book on the stand on his shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.822" offset="13750627">In Roth, as we pointed out, there was intrusion into the homes of the unwilling person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.514" offset="13777377">There were mailings, there were mailings which were exploiting there can't be any denial in terms of the advertising there being at least very aggressive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.775" offset="13830457">That differs entirely from the situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.170" offset="13852087">The situation we have here is simply whether a person who sells books is to be treated differently because he is selling books, because he is selling the ideas whether he is to be treated differently than a person who is selling these cattle or a person who happens to have a machine gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.002" offset="13959398">A point was made in terms of the buyer or book buyer taking normal precautions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.786" offset="13994506">Well, the record here shows that the -- Mr. Smith took normal precautions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.960" offset="14011225">The record shows that he purchased his book through the mail, that he received it from regular jobbers, that he had a book in this case, “Sweeter than Life” which was copyrighted and we've heard a lot about copyright and whoever heard of copyrighting pornographic literature before anyhow?</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.722" offset="14098265">Isn't the bookseller protected at least to that extent to be seeing the copyright?</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.855" offset="14126791">Well, no it's taken by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.859" offset="14134836">It's -- the book is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.019" offset="14143404">It's in the congressional library and anybody can go in and buy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.194" offset="14160123">I don't know what kind of evil Mr. Arnebergh is talking about the evil of this book.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.341" offset="14188753">He's taken everything he could find out of the book and hit it like he has put into his brief, all of these graphic descriptions and it went through the mail and everybody has read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.429" offset="14241102">No evil, this isn't eating poison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.583" offset="14253746">Would anybody for a moment suggest that the reading of this brief which is the undiluted assets that Mr. Arnebergh is complaining about, is anything there, maybe accept something that would offend your personal taste and that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.302" offset="14324590">Insofar as we're talking about the moral, Mr. Arnebergh says there is a lesson here that lesbianism is good.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.319" offset="14368684">I happen to read the book differently, but this Court said that you can talk about adultery that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.927" offset="14399091">That you can even advocate adultery and that doesn't offend the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.068" offset="14427617">And if that's what the book said, I deny it, but if it is what the book said that would not be private in any fashion we submit from the protection afforded by free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.128" offset="14475891">I think the Court has pointed out the obvious fallacy or what seems to me to be the obvious fallacy of the copyright argument in that society is concerned much more with the right of the people to read than it is with the right of a person to say what he wants to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.721" offset="14550288">The right to say it is important, but the right of people to hear it and weigh it is far more important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.256" offset="14580381">And that includes the right to weigh and consider ideas we do not like and that is what's in jeopardy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.932" offset="14619146">Mr. Arnebergh recognized that you have to take free speech out to attempt to rationalize the illogical and the unfair aspects of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.295" offset="14664600">I don't think you can read free speech out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.627" offset="14677870">The right to distribute the book is equally protected with the right to -- right of the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.054" offset="14695633">Thank you very much Your Honor.</text>
