            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 56, United States, Petitioner, versus Republic Steel Corporation, et al.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="14.195" offset="160162">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.606" offset="189837">This action involves the question of an obstruction to navigation in a water that's under the jurisdiction of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.669" offset="246053">The United States maintained the action in the trial court and it was reversed in the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.957" offset="291192">It involves two questions, one is whether or not industrial waste can be poured into the channel of the Calumet River without being a violation of the law of the United States and secondly, whether the United States isn't entitled to an injunction against such action.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.561" offset="401638">The scene of this activity is in the channel of the Calumet River about 11 miles south to the City of Chicago, along the state lines of Indiana and Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.311" offset="480632">The respondents are three large manufacturing operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.425" offset="501112">One of them engaged in iron manufacture, amongst other things, Interlake and the other two engaged in both iron and steel along with the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.138" offset="563911">The other two are Republic and -- Republic Steel and International Harvester.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.472" offset="601213">There is no dispute on the facts in regard to certain aspects of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.419" offset="629008">We do not, on behalf of the Government, think that the factual issue is before the Court now.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.316" offset="656593">It was reserved by the Court of Appeals and was not gone into.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.393" offset="672893">There are contentions by the respondents that the facts did not bear out the findings of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.013" offset="703404">The Court made elaborate findings after a long trial and found against the respondents in regard to the factual matters and their principal contention where that the shoals or interference reduction of the channel of this river were due to natural causes and other manufacturing institutions and not alone to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.978" offset="823254">The Court found that 81%, a little over 81%, of the amount of the interference or obstruction to navigation was due to these -- the activities of the -- these three respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.914" offset="883022">There are 27 sewers or outfalls from which this waste from these manufacturing concerns including flue dust and other things came out into this channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.822" offset="938611">And this quite -- it's agreed between the parties that about 0 -- 0.02% of the amount of the material was the -- the kind that caused this interference or obstruction of the channel of the Calumet River.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.780" offset="1034533">That is not a very large amount concededly, but when you take into account the fact that they used six billions of gallons of water out of the river each month and multiply that by 12 and you have a 72 billions of gallons of water during a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.592" offset="1117706">You can see that even with .02% being of these settleable solids that it could be a substantial amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.294" offset="1160547">And then the record shows that converting this to what was established as going into the channel during the years 1952 to 1955, you find that the Republic Steel Company put in according to their proof, 19,000, during these four years, 19,000 tons of this material, or according to the Government's proof, 27,000 tons of the material during four years or better than 6000 tons of this interference during this -- during each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.313" offset="1332642">It didn't work out exactly that way because there were some times when the plants were down and that had to be taken into account and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.489" offset="1361377">So, it was established over the four-year period of 1952 to 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.500" offset="1385409">Interlake's figure was an agreed figure of 20,000 tons for the four years or approximately 5000 tons that they put into this channel and International Harvester was in excess of 27,000 tons of such material for the same period.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.792" offset="1474539">So even that 0.02%, you can see that the amount was very great that was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.133" offset="1507871">Now, the statute is Section 10 and 13 are the ones in issue here of the Act of the United States in regard to obstructions to navigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="709.089" offset="2939695">You see, it makes an absolute prohibition if you turn 47 -- page 47 and says that the creation of any obstruction not affirmatively authorized by Congress to the navigable capacity of any other waters of the United States is hereby prohibited.</text>

            <text syncTime="737.573" offset="3053693">Now, the reason for the passage of 1890 Act was that this Court had held in the Willamette Iron Bridge case that there was no common law that would preclude obstructions to navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.961" offset="3107192">There is no federal common law and so, there had -- that the United States when it tried to stop such obstructions would have to turn to the state law and very promptly after that, Senator Dole who had -- was involved in the losing sight on that case brought this matter to the attention of Congress and proposed this legislation and got it through, that's the 1890 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.245" offset="3208338">Then thereafter, the lower court -- lower federal court and there -- and later this Court when it reached it, held that under the 1890 Act as you will notice on page 46, had a provision that unless it's affirmatively authorized by law, in the first sentence of Section 10 there, a lower federal court held that affirmatively authorized by law was satisfied by state law and so that was called to the attention of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.245" offset="3392345">That case along with other things by the Chief of the Corps of Engineers and Congress to take care of that put in the language affirmatively authorized by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.192" offset="3448142">Now, that wasn't all that happened between 1890 and 1899.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.175" offset="3468100">And the way that Congress had been dealing with this subject, they had taken the Rivers and Harbors Bills each time and they had put a provision about obstructions to navigations beginning back in 1890 and then in a subsequent year, they would put another provision about obstructions and navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.429" offset="3545109">And the Congress said in 1896 to the Corps of Engineers, “Won't you please get together our revisions?</text>
            <text syncTime="866.997" offset="3571336">So, we'll have in one place, all of the things that are involved in this question of obstructions to navigation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="874.401" offset="3601011">And the Corps of Engineers did that and Congress suggested that they provide any amendments or corrections of ambiguities or emendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.806" offset="3662555">And the Corps of Engineers brought forth the proposed Act that became the 1899 statute in this one that's -- that we're relying on here and it is the principle at involving this question and they said they'd made certain revisions and additions, but no emendate -- emendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.093" offset="3747715">No -- they hadn't taken anything out.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.008" offset="3759417">They tried to make this complete codification and they presented that to Senator Frye, who then brought that before the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.093" offset="3803721">And this history is very important to this case, because it shows the congressional intent and Senator Frye brought it out before the Congress and he said, “This legislation, it has some minor revisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.650" offset="3869968">No material changes and you don't even have to read it,” don't have to or have it read to the Congress at this time before passing on, because that's what I represented is.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.858" offset="3914794">It's already been before the Committee and that's what we're doing and it's in the light of that, that the Congress then passed the 1899 Act to -- that's involved here and not showing no intention on the part of the Congress to reduce the effect of the prior Act of 1890 in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.599" offset="4025762">Now, in addition to that, this Court has already said in two cases, in the Sanitary District case and also in Wisconsin against Illinois, that the purpose of the 1899 Act was to enlarge and -- and add to -- and it was very clear the intention and purpose of the Congress to cover this whole area of forcefully (Inaudible) of obstructions to navigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1370.604" offset="5585795">So the Court has already held that those which are certainly outside of any other kind of structures that are referred to in these other sections and that counsel -- that respondents urge, it should be limited, were sufficient that the United States could get an injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1536.040" offset="6247528">We think that's one of the lesser problems in the case because of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.600" offset="6265814">When Congress refers to the kind of plans or a program for a particular type of construction, it generally refers to works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.792" offset="6318582">And if you'll notice that -- that the respondents in their brief had referred to a number of references, I think it's in the footnote in which they -- it's repeatedly treated as works and not as work as it is done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.225" offset="6380231">That is a -- that is a nice distinction, but it's one that Congress deals with all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.778" offset="6402487">And I think in -- you just examine some of the statutes about public works and the Rivers and Harbors bills and all of those things and you'll see it's generally a question of works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.574" offset="6445641">Now, if you'll look above in the same statute, Section 10 (2), you'll also see that it says, except on plans --</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.935" offset="6539160">And if you'll notice, the whole concept here was to try -- was to treat some of these things differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.633" offset="6569880">Now, an obstruction to navigation as such, was being condemned by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.843" offset="6594748">The Congress didn't want any kind of an obstruction to navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.071" offset="6615646">Then, it was leaving and out however, for certain things that may not be complete obstruction to navigation, but might be in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.225" offset="6664234">And that's the way this Court construed it in the two cases I've referred to that there could be not and unreasonable or that there could be a reasonable interference with navigation and there isn't any question but what some of these things that are named in the second and third clauses here, do interfere with navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.925" offset="6743124">You just look at them and read them and you'll see that there isn't any question, but what they would keep a vessel from going through that particular kind of construction or even a fill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.797" offset="6790562">But it might be necessary to have a fill at a certain point, in order to develop a proper channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.185" offset="6820133">It's done on the Mississippi River and the Missouri all the time that they're built all kinds of constructions in order to direct the channel in a certain manner and yet, it would interfere with anybody taking a vessel on the old channel or other places that have been commonly used for navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.495" offset="6897351">So, it is an order to provide for them that the Congress said, “There shall be no obstruction in navigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.750" offset="7182399">The Court of Appeals read Section 10 and said, since these provisions for the -- for the Secretary of War to grant a permit for certain -- for a fill and these other modifying course, location, condition or capacity of any harbor, canal and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.642" offset="7237987">And I want to call the attention to the fact that Sanitary District and Wisconsin against Illinois were exactly there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.222" offset="7300263">They did modify and change the harbor and canal and so forth in this very situation, because they permitted this water to be drawn out of the Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.910" offset="7355016">No question but what it was reducing, the size and the depth of Lake Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.243" offset="7380302">And it was changing that, but the Court of Appeals held that since there was -- you couldn't allow a fill like this, like these in litigation here, because they would obstruct navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.514" offset="7433383">That's what exactly what they do, because this is a 21-channel -- 20-foot -- one-foot channel, 200 feet wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.246" offset="7468387">And the evidence is clear that it has been reduced from 21 feet, by this action, to 17 feet and in some instance, 12 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.118" offset="7511855">Now, that is unquestionably very destructive of the great volume of navigation that's involved in this very channel, one of the principal navigation channels of commerce in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.953" offset="7587192">The volume that goes through here is very great, not only to these people, but all along this channel in this -- the Sag channel and down to the Illinois River to the Chicago Sanitary Canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.478" offset="7645288">So, the courts said, “Well, since they couldn't approve it, it couldn't be precluded by the first section.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.057" offset="7675591">And the Government says, “That's absurd.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.391" offset="7684890">That's a wrong leading of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.117" offset="7691891">If it's something that couldn't be approved, Congress didn't want it allowed by anybody except itself, if it was such an obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.969" offset="7727208">If it was so great an obstruction that the -- it's obvious it would be an unreasonable interference with navigation, then it certainly couldn't be approved by anybody, but Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.063" offset="7775587">On the other hand, it provided these other provisions so that if it was something that was reasonable and it was desirable in order to get its benefits as distinguished from some liabilities or detriments that would be involved, then the Secretary of War was allowed in these particular situations, to permit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.502" offset="7877360">And that provides -- that's the reason why they added these other clause in regard to the fill and the change in location.</text>

            <text syncTime="3020.785" offset="12186520">Yes, Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.012" offset="12191431">I add that on, but in order to deal with the inherent power and the -- and the equitable right, I say that there's other provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.244" offset="12224345">Now, I'd like to deal just briefly with this question of their claim that back in 1890 in -- in that -- and 1899 when these laws were passed, everybody knew that this kind of material was going out in the sewers and therefore, it's absurd to claim that this exception wasn't provided to take care of this very thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.147" offset="12307937">I think they are seriously affected on that argument if you examine it, by the fact that Congress was careful to provide that the Secretary of War could allow permits even as to Section 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.714" offset="12358196">So that if it was the kind of thing that had to be done in the interest of carrying on the competing interest, there is a provision for it, assuming that it isn't an absolute obstruction to navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.063" offset="12411591">It's something that could be construed as being reasonable and I assume that that competing interest would have to be reasonable in order to be justified in its competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.266" offset="12452446">But going beyond that, it's claimed that there -- here is an Attorney General's opinion which they cite on page 32 of International Harvester Company brief, 32 of the International Harvester Company brief and they say it's an 1894 opinion and they use it to say that the Attorney General refused to give an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.427" offset="12529037">And therefore, they say that since he didn't refer to the other sections when they asked him about Section 6 and its effect, which was now Section 13 substantially, that he must've recognized that the only possible place for -- that there could be any application to Section 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.177" offset="12656097">Now, there are several things wrong with that argument, I want to deal with very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.038" offset="12671561">First, the opinion was given 1897 and not 1894 as they state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.966" offset="12691205">Secondly, the law that they referred to was the 1894 law and it didn't have in it the Section 10 and the provisions that we refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.327" offset="12752645">That was in a different statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.275" offset="12760482">And third, the Attorney General was only asked about this particular one, but the thing that cuts against them very greatly, is the further language as you get down to the bottom of that opinion in which he is dealing with the fact that he's asked as to application of this particular statute, Section 6, that's now, substantially Section 13 and then he says what the statute provides and that's in quotes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.803" offset="12866539">And then he says, “Whether or not, the bar complained of is formed by discharge from the sewer which so far as appears, is left to inference and whether the sand or other materials discharged merely in suspension and is then deposited upon the bar by the ordinary prompt action of gravity or passes out in solution and is then precipitated, are facts that he must have before he can answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.017" offset="12967476">Now, I think that shows how unreasonable or -- or unsupported their claim is that people at that time didn't think of the very thing that we're claiming in this case as the difference between settleable and suspended particles when he says exactly the description we have, I've got to know, are these the kind of particles that are going to fall down or are they going to continue in suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.214" offset="13092237">And if you tell me that, then I can answer this question which shows that in order to try to answer what was in a liquid state, he was looking for exactly the kind of thing we tell this Court now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.927" offset="13143124">These are settleable particles that did do fall down and will fall down and do form an obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.043" offset="13175515">And if there was any idea at that time that people were doing this to such an extent, that it would be absurd to make such a claim today, then why would the Attorney General pose a very question that we say is controlling?</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.765" offset="13234448">Now, there's no question of what these very particles are obstructions, they are settleable and they have formed this obstruction and caused this great reduction in this channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.171" offset="13288051">Now, they form it in -- in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.826" offset="13298709">They really form a structure and I'm not urging that as satisfying the provisions of -- of the Section in regard to structures and injunction at all, but actually, as described by the engineers and technicians, these particles, iron particles and others that come out of this waste have an electric charge and they form what is called flocculation so that they interlace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.100" offset="13415737">And they then form a regular small building in this channel and you can pour sand, you can pour other kinds of sludge and other waste in it and it will be the same capacity, the same size after you get through as is it was immediately before, because it will fit within the structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.213" offset="13500270">So that -- that they in effect, is the flocculation really of these particular particles as they settle out that builds them into structure that makes it impossible to navigate in the area where they are.</text>

Bodman, who is here and he is counsel for respondent, International Harvester Company, that in view of the Court's reluctance to permit three counsel to argue on one side although separate cases, he waives his right to do so and will not participate in the oral argument, but rely upon his brief and he hopes upon arguments of counsel for the other respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.687" offset="14786121">We may wish to withdraw that later.[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.985" offset="14815274">Now, if the Court please, I should like briefly to set out my conception of what is before this Court on certiorari in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.696" offset="14874206">And sufficient of the factual segment, so as to make intelligible the discussion of the statutes which are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.213" offset="14932198">As has been said, the Government brought an action in which it alleged that each of the respondents violated Section 9 and Section 13 of the R &amp; H Act of 1899 and prayed for injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.142" offset="15015894">The Court of Appeals held that the petitioner had failed to establish a violation of either Section 10 or Section 13 of the 1899 Act and then is a cumulative ground of decision that even if a violation of either section had been established, the remedies created by Congress for the violation of those sections are severally exclusive and do not authorize petitioner to maintain any civil action on this relation to this subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.235" offset="15232293">Now, very briefly, the respondent's own plant from the Calumet River and if in -- of interest, their general location is shown on the map, it's back of the International Harvester Company brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.337" offset="15312750">The -- and Interlake Iron Corporation which happens to be my client, operates coke ovens and two blast furnaces to produce pig iron for the merchant trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.298" offset="15384534">In the operation of the coke ovens and the blast furnaces, it withdraws water from the Calumet River which already contains some suspended solids.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.366" offset="15448795">In these operations unavoidably, coke ovens create some coke breeze and blast furnace creates some flue dust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.830" offset="15510653">Each consists principally of very fine particles and so far as here, a material is very fine, many of them being so small that they cannot be seen with the aid of an ordinary microscope.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.977" offset="15575228">Now, each of these products are valuable, they have commercial value and Interlake uses numerous processes and various equipment to recover all of these coke breeze and flue dust to the greatest practical extent, from the water before it throws back through its sewers into the Calumet River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.127" offset="15711901">Now, some of this small amount of this very fine material, it cannot practically be recovered from the water before it returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.027" offset="15767489">So, it -- and it is carried in suspension or a solution depending upon your technical definition of terms and some of it may well deposit at unforeseeable times in unknown places, either in the privately owned slip adjacent to the plant in the river, but not within the navigation channel and probably some of it in the navigation channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.410" offset="15908968">Now, Interlake regularly dredges its private slip and in the part of its plant and the -- however, the net result is for the purposes of the questions here presented, that as the Solicitor General has said, the effluent or outflow from the sewers of these respondents is 99 -- just more 98% water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.414" offset="16025057">Now, I should say that the other respondents, International Harvester and Republic Steel Corporation also operates coke ovens and blast furnaces to produces pig iron for their own use, in their own plants which they then convert into steel and into some steel products.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.412" offset="16189001">And as appears from my map, the very large plant of U.S. Steel and Youngstown Sheet and Tube are located at the Lake, which since Chicago reversed the Calumet River, is now the source instead of the mouth, so that any material from those plants would pass downstream towards the plants of the respective respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.067" offset="16315643">Now then, in our view, the simple question is whether the discharge of sewer outflow or effluent of which 99 -- just more 98% is water, but which carry some small amount of very fine materials that may settle out admittedly, as here or there, is a violation of Section 9 or Section 13 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.</text>

            <text syncTime="4107.872" offset="16534862">Later, one side of the moment, the question of what remedy if any, would be available in the event the petitioner had established a violation of either section.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.636" offset="16589928">Now, in order to -- to -- before discussing these specific statutes, I should like to mention some considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.790" offset="16642487">Something of the background upon which I believe this -- the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and the material sections must be construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.082" offset="16719705">First, as I shall show a little later, the River and Harbors Act of March 4, 1899 was a comprehensive and all inclusive revision of all general laws with minor exceptions that I will mention later, for the protection of navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.171" offset="16832031">In which the Congress carefully segregated the different segments of the old river problem, its different process in particular sections and made a similarly discriminating choice of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.168" offset="16900054">Now, when Congress enacted these Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899, it was exercising its exclusive constitutional authority under the Commerce Clause of our Constitution, to balance the national interest in navigation and non-navigation uses of our navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.631" offset="17025860">Concededly, throughout the history of our country, in 1899 and even today, the -- the non-navigable -- navigation, uses of navigable waters for domestic use, for manufacture and a host of other purposes, have been essential to the development and the maintenance of our national economy and incidentally to the development and maintenance of the tax resources upon which both national and local governments could depend.</text>
            <text syncTime="4270.644" offset="17185938">Now, I think it -- it necessarily -- it necessarily follows that in undertaking such a problem, Congress necessarily segregated the different process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.284" offset="17268485">Provided different regulations, provided different remedies and as I shall try to show later, there is no room for trying to transpose, draft the one section of -- of a substantive section on another, one remedy upon another remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.336" offset="17356675">Then, we say one word about the -- Section 10 of the Act of 1890, works with great deference in certainly, all respect, I say that the petitioner here has been forced into the untenable propositions for our position of contending that Section 10 of the Act of 1890 was not repealed, because it suddenly discovered the even if it could prove a violation of Section 10 of the Act of 1899, it had -- the Congress had not provided the equitable remedy which it was seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.850" offset="17514768">Now later, I would like to -- I would like to come back to that a little further.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.091" offset="17547786">Then, I -- I know -- I want to turn to -- well, I want to say one other thing, quite inadvertently I'm sure, the Solicitor General overstated what he conceived to be the degree of agreed facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4394.217" offset="17680280">So far as I know, there are no agreed facts except that we operate the plants that we -- return the water the way that we have specified and that so much of it is water, as the Solicitor General stated himself on -- in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.206" offset="17744227">Now, there is no -- there's a question of settleable solids.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.826" offset="17766693">Anything in suspension most -- well, deposit sometime -- it's just a question of time -- just the question of condition and there is as far as I have ever found, no water known to nature in a pristine forest, which does not carry some solids in suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.722" offset="17858226">Now, these very fine particles which are carried in the sewer outflows of these respondents are inert.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.055" offset="17899604">They are not percussible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.429" offset="17909112">And to speak about how the sewage in the light disappears, is wholly irrelevant and -- and I -- if I may, with diffidence say incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.386" offset="17968880">It is true that if you discharge percussible material into flowing water, it will oxidize that material so that it will no longer be percussible, noxious --</text>

            <text syncTime="4520.242" offset="18184338">I only want to spend a minute on it, because I think it's tied too closely to the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="4528.707" offset="18218193">In -- we contend first that Section 13 of the 1899 Act is the only such -- which has any application to the respondents' acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4553.723" offset="18318294">And that Section 10 of the 1899 Act is wholly inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.728" offset="18366255">The -- this -- the Act of 1899 was not only a comprehensive, but all inclusive revision, but it was made with great care.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.366" offset="18420799">The -- the Congress directed the Secretary of War and the army engineers in 1896 to -- to review all of the general laws which had been passed from time to time for the protection of navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.169" offset="18516093">You report them to the same and their recommendations as revision emendates in our enlargement of the laws as he thought at that cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.297" offset="18552560">Now, that was done and the report was made on February 13, 1897.</text>
            <text syncTime="4618.717" offset="18578265">And the statute which in -- the graft statute which in large part, became the Act of 1899, was before the members of Congress for over two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.987" offset="18623300">This was not any hasty act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.970" offset="18639287">Incidentally, it explains perhaps the limit on repeal because the Secretary recommended that there be no change made in two existing laws since they had already been construed by the courts and regulations have been promulgated by the Department under them, they authorized regulations for certain purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4660.306" offset="18744613">Of course, it would be singular indeed to find that the Congress having given this one reason for asking this careful and comprehensive revision of all the general laws to be made.</text>

            <text syncTime="4774.560" offset="19201651">The question here involves the discharge or deposit of refuse matter into navigable water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.359" offset="19244805">Section 13 of the 1899 Act regulates that subject matter in detail and comprehensively.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.968" offset="19287228">Section 10 of the 1899 Act does not in my opinion deal with that subject matter at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.776" offset="19322441">But if it did -- if you can say that the -- the generality of its language in a broadest stream might be held to encompass to discharge of or deposit of refuse matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.638" offset="19389942">The settled principle as I understand it is that in the same statute, a section in which Congress had expressly and specifically regulated one segment of the overall subject matter, is the exclusive and controlling regulation of that facet of the subject matter even though there maybe another section with such general language that it could be construed to encompass the specific section.</text>

            <text syncTime="5131.306" offset="20628564">Then in particular, of course, it mentions particularly establishment or mill of any kind of manufacturing plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5141.127" offset="20667852">Then, the language follows any refuse matter of any kind or description, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.726" offset="20702229">Now, that language is also sweeping an inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.278" offset="20720515">Now, we then come to this significant language, other than that point from streets and sewers and passing there from -- in a liquid state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.657" offset="20765968">First, I have observed that that exception is -- as the all inclusive and sweeping as -- as the language with respect to the source of the refuse matter and the kind of refuse matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.051" offset="20843604">I also invite attention to the fact that admittedly, everything which falls within that exception is not a violation of Section 13 and I submit cannot be a violation of any other section.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.114" offset="20907865">Now then, we come to this -- and that's when about the bank provision about deposits on the bank are not here involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="5213.814" offset="20958647">Now, reference has been made to -- to the matter of the certain permits under certain conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5222.101" offset="20991770">I -- I reject the Solicitor General's construction of that for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5234.907" offset="21042970">First, it plainly has no application to the language which I -- from which I quoted in regard to the general prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5249.796" offset="21102529">Secondly, in the case of any discharge or deposit which comes within the exception created by the Congress, manifestly, there can be no violation of the section and there can be no need for a permit and obviously Congress didn't authorized the permit where it was wholly unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.199" offset="21192182">Now then, in the court below, the Government was faced with a problem here seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.725" offset="21222275">And there, they urged upon the lower court that this exception included only a -- only sewer outflows or streets runoffs, which did not contain any material in suspension or anything of that -- other than water which was not impermanent solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5306.053" offset="21327600">On our course manifestly, such a construction would render the exception inapplicable to any new sewer outflow or street runoff and I believe to any known natural stream, even though it would be in the wilds of Canada where as yet, there has been little contamination, if any, from civilization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.275" offset="21432508">Or obviously, that you could hardly expect that Congress intended -- put in the exception for nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5341.551" offset="21469602">The next proposition is that the Congress was exercising its exclusive constitutional authority to balance the national and non-national interest in the uses of navigable water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5357.408" offset="21533027">And under these facts as they existed in 1899 and as they exist today, such an extreme statute as would be represented by the construction claimed by the petitioner, would bring to a standstill, industrial activity in both urban and rural life.</text>
            <text syncTime="5377.440" offset="21613171">These -- these consequences to the economy would be hard to tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="5381.279" offset="21628531">Now, a great problem, great view is made to the fact that there maybe some of these deposits and that might somehow and some unknown extent, increase the normal and conceding it isn't normal, annual or periodic costs of maintenance dredging, our maintenance cost which is incident to practically all the navigational improvements and particularly on rivers where they are made by enlarging a natural channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5409.098" offset="21739813">Now of course, the obvious answer to that is that the Congress must have concluded either that it would be equitable for the Government to gain and to bear any increase in maintenance dredging, if there might be, or that the alternative was to -- would -- would create chaos, would be disastrous from the standpoint of the national economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5440.001" offset="21863424">No one argues that the Congress could not completely shut down these plants tomorrow, which can operate only by discharging these -- these effluence into these things, but we do not believe the Congress did or ever will exercise any such -- make any such arbitrary exercise of its plenary power under the Commerce Clause.</text>
