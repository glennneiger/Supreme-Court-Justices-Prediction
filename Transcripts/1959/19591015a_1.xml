            <text syncTime="716.346" offset="2968743">This is the reference that the Government makes to the fact that -- they -- they claim that the Government's lien attached to the contractual obligation of the owner to the general contractor and not for the real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.177" offset="3024123">And I think that that's immaterial, but in order to -- let's see how the Government gets away from that -- supports that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.103" offset="3063829">They say -- they say that two decisions of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York to wit, a so-called Raymond case, 288 N.Y. 452 and a Sulphur case, 290 N.Y. 903 held that the contractual obligation of an owner to a general contractor was -- was property of the general contractor was that and could therefore, be reached by judgment creditors or Federal Government lien or whatnot.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.388" offset="3196949">The fact remains that those decisions may have, despite the fact that I disagree with it, they may have been good law because -- but they were based and founded on a -- upon a construction of the law prior to the 1942 Amendment, which amendment -- which amendment included the contractual obligation as part of the trust.</text>

            <text syncTime="838.061" offset="3455666">I don't think that the Court of Appeals of New York appreciated that they had the right to dispose of this on a basis of what the state law was.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.910" offset="3503000">They were under the impression that they were precluded from determining that.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.006" offset="3523375">And the -- the strange part of it is that another case in which this Court has just granted cert in a -- the so-called Coblentz case.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.883" offset="3562872">They decided on the basis of this law of the State of New York that an attorney's lien under the judiciary law of the State of New York did constitute property of Coblentz, the attorney and wasn't -- and was superior to the lien of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.126" offset="3639881">So, now, as to whether or not this is property of the -- whose property this is against which the Government has filed the lien or claim the lien?</text>
            <text syncTime="898.537" offset="3697560">Let's look to the law of the State of New York, both the legislative and judicial history of that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.542" offset="3733504">I happen to have been practicing prior to -- in New York prior to the time that this law was passed in 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.881" offset="3762866">Prior to that time, there was nothing to stop a general contractor from performing a contract with an owner, collecting all the money that was due and then absconding, leaving the subcontractors and the materialmen high and dry.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.121" offset="3827858">We finally got pretty fed up with that situation and amend the Lien Law so as to provide that a contractor who collected money from an owner or an owner who collected money from a mortgagee -- from a mortgagee and who did not use the moneys for the purpose of paying subcontractors and materialmen, was guilty of a diversion and guilty of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.098" offset="3943737">I'll put a stop to a great deal of it, but then as usual, they found ways and means of avoiding that and so we have continuously amended the law right down to date, so that we believe that under the law of the State of New York, there was a complete valid trust for the benefit of subcontractors, materialmen and the few others mentioned of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.392" offset="4056900">Now, with respect to the elements of this trust, first of all, it identifies the trust assets, and I'm reading from the statute now.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.397" offset="4092949">It says that the funds received by a contractor from an owner, from an owner for the improvement of real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.361" offset="4120848">So we have no question as to the identification of the corpus of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.083" offset="4139656">Then it designates a place of beneficiaries and it specifically says subcontractors, laborers, materialmen and it list others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.236" offset="4176332">Then it designates the trustee and it says, “That the funds constituting this trust shall -- are hereby declared to be trust funds in the hands of such contractor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.388" offset="4224920">So we now have a trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.311" offset="4236622">Other sections of the statute which we inadvertently did not have pointed, specifically requires them to keep books and records and as a matter of fact, the statute very elaborately says why he shall keep in the books and records and how he shall keep that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.732" offset="4298271">It requires him to furnish an accounting to anyone of the beneficiaries of this trust anytime upon 10 days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.436" offset="4337142">Now, it has -- it -- it also authorizes any beneficiary to examine the books and records, to examine checkbooks, any of the ledger accounts, specifically set forth in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.928" offset="4387088">So that we have every single essential element of a vital trust in this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1467.359" offset="5972825">Now, would be anomalous to say the least, that parties to a contract could -- could prevent the United States Government from collecting taxes against to delinquent taxpayer by putting the proper clause in a contract, but that the State of New York with its sovereign power and through his judiciary, cannot protect the subcontractor from the Government coming in and taking its moneys as they have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.151" offset="6724002">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.661" offset="6741974">We have here two creditors of a general contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.534" offset="6757543">The creditors are competing for something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.158" offset="6767992">They're competing for the proceeds of the construction contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.491" offset="6785337">One creditor, the United States, asserts that its tax lien which here arose prior to the proceeds of the construction contract becoming due, gives it prior rights to this fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.294" offset="6836537">The other group of creditors, subcontractors, asserts that the trust fund provisions of New York State law give them a prior right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.822" offset="6874676">Now, the chronology, we submit, is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.661" offset="6886066">The tax lien arose first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.540" offset="6897560">It was followed by the taxpayer entering into a contract to do some construction work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.114" offset="6923786">He proceeded to complete that contract to the satisfaction of the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.559" offset="6941654">Shows in action arose at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.041" offset="6955551">This was property of the taxpayer, and it was this shows an action to which the tax lien attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.951" offset="6987212">A New York law provides that the funds which a contractor has due to him on a construction contract shall, to the extent that any subcontractors are unpaid at that time, be held in trust for their benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.855" offset="7050742">And that is where the basis for the competing claims of the subcontractors derived from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.777" offset="7078431">Now, what is it that we're dealing with?</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.863" offset="7090866">The New York State statute provides that the subcontractors have this trust right only to the extent that there is any debt owing from the owner of the property to the general contractor taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.093" offset="7155754">The effect of the decision below in which the owner turned into court the funds which was still owing to the contractor, was to discharge the owner from any further liability to the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.763" offset="7218448">The basis for the subcontractors' claims here is that there was money due and owing to the contractor which is held in trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.774" offset="7250422">This is the basis, the foundations with the trust under New York State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.429" offset="7269125">The trust does not arise unless moneys are owing to the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.302" offset="7288560">The complaint here, which was filed by each of these subcontractors in the lower court, alleges that as a necessary allegation of their cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.764" offset="7322415">Moneys were due to the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.910" offset="7330983">The contractor earned these moneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.327" offset="7340701">There is no defense to the contractors claim by the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.066" offset="7355643">Therefore, under New York law, we have prior rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.234" offset="7372257">Now, we submit that in that context while the subcontractors here may choose to use a verbal variant of the contentions which have presented -- have been presented to this Court in previous cases that this is precisely the same kind of issue which this Court has had before, many times in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.946" offset="7455117">In essence, the subcontractors are arguing here that because under the provisions of New York law, their rights are impregnable to those of any other creditors of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.732" offset="7506317">For that reason, they must also come prior to the reach of the federal tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.623" offset="7529827">Now, that is precisely the kind of argument which this Court has rejected in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.166" offset="7548008">It rejected it through in situations where the security which the subcontractor was asserting with a lien on real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.905" offset="7583013">Here, the security which the subcontractor asserts is, in essence, a lien on a chose in action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.803" offset="7606627">Under New York law, he has the right to reach this chose in action and apply it in satisfaction of his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.397" offset="7632959">The Government submits that it makes no difference whether the property of the taxpayer be real estate or whether it be a chose in action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.992" offset="7663365">The principle which this Court has defined in the past are equally applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.068" offset="7683636">Now, this Court has reached the issue of the rights of mechanic's liens as against those of the United States in many situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.325" offset="7716655">It has reached that, for example, in the White Bear case, where the mechanic's lien preceded was antecedent to the federal tax lien and where everything had been done under state law, which would render the mechanics' rights impregnable to attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.110" offset="7779767">Nevertheless, this Court held that the federal tax lien was superior.</text>

            <text syncTime="1952.701" offset="7914141">That New York cannot adopt a statute which, in effect, is a priority statute and which gives a creditor of the taxpayer a preferred position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.338" offset="7964714">And then under the guise of saying, “Well, since no other creditor under New York law can reach this property, the taxpayer has no property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1975.476" offset="8005256">We submit to characterize it in term, what is, in essence, a preference statute in terms of property doesn't -- doesn't solve the question.</text>
