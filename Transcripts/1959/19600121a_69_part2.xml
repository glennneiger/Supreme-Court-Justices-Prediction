            <text syncTime="7.761" offset="134457">They didn't discuss whether he was an occupant or whether he was a licensee or what he had dominion.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Henkin</label>
            <text syncTime="21.059" offset="187643">On the original motion, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.811" offset="198614">The guest rule of -- seems to have been invoked more often in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.875" offset="218885">It is not unanimously involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.410" offset="229021">In any event, we suggest that it's a rule which really deserves some examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.572" offset="257651">There are guests and guests.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.319" offset="264652">If someone lends me his house for a year and I'm living there as a guest, I'm sure no one would challenge for that -- my status as regard to the Fourth Amendment and under -- in that house, is quite different from perhaps a man in somebody else's house of 20 other people there and he's there as a guest, too.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="57.134" offset="331943">You have the man who came to dinner.</text>

          <turn speaker="louis_henkin" startTime="58.859" stopTime="191.197">
            <label>Mr. Louis Henkin</label>
            <text syncTime="58.859" offset="338840">The man came to dinner -- what is clear is that no -- no guest case cited by the district judge below, no case cited by the Government deals with the kind of guest you had in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.797" offset="394533">A fellow who is in the apartment without the owner there, so that he's a guest of some conceptual sense, of course, but he's not there by sufferance of someone else who has the right and the power to assert his responsibility for the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.831" offset="458689">In this case, and this is the only case, we submit, this -- in this case, he was in charge of the apartment whether you call him guest or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.719" offset="494216">If Arthur Evans had been there, that might be a different question, that's not the course.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.118" offset="515845">But none of the cases cited involved a case, where the man was there not in the presence of the owner and was in charge of the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.424" offset="553044">The guest rule has been suggested in this Court before, it has never been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.375" offset="576867">In the McDonald case, so the Court will recall, the majority said even if we assume that a guest in the apartment of another -- in the presence of another in that case, has no standing under the Fourth Amendment, we will still exclude the evidence because it had to be excluded from McDonald, therefore, we would exclude it for Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.228" offset="648234">On the notion that if it had been returned to McDonald, as McDonald has originally requested, it wouldn't be available for Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.521" offset="677491">Three of the justices in that Court suggested that there's no reason why a guest should not enjoy the privacy of -- the right to privacy under the rooftree of a friend anymore than anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.536" offset="725556">What basically we have here is a man who borrows an apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.664" offset="746036">And a man who borrows an apartment should have the same rights of privacy in that apartment as anyone else, as anybody who owns the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.347" offset="776756">Interestingly enough, a man who borrows a car is not his, just borrows it for an afternoon, no one has ever denied his right to object to the seizure of that car.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.532" offset="813537">In fact, in the Henry case decided just a few weeks ago here, the Court will recall that Henry objected to the seizure of materials in the automobile because his arrest went unlawful.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="191.197" offset="868185">I suppose if you have occasion had given a car on a trailer, which I take it's one that is wrong personally, I'd suppose anybody who do this (Inaudible)</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Henkin</label>
            <text syncTime="206.847" offset="930774">Perhaps, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.498" offset="945403">In the Henry case, interestingly enough, no one claimed -- no one claimed that Henry didn't have the right to object to the seizure of the materials on the car simply because it wasn't his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.916" offset="991065">In fact, he was not only a guest in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.182" offset="1000051">He was a guest of a guest.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.837" offset="1006738">The driver borrowed the car from someone else, as the record shows, and he was invited to ride in it and yet, no one suggested that in that case because the automobile was borrowed rather than owned or because the owner wasn't there or because, for some reason or other, the relation to the automobile is only temporary that therefore he should have no standing and of course, the automobile would generally doesn't have anyone near the kind of protection that -- that the dwelling has.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.248" offset="1116348">There is one case before this Court, which we refer in our brief on page 29, the Kremen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.966" offset="1143202">The Court decided that per curiam.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.989" offset="1155323">It's -- it appears that in that case, the crime involved was harboring fugitives from justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.708" offset="1186252">Someone had hired a cabin under an assumed name and the other three persons were found in the cabin with them and they searched and -- and seized lots of materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.835" offset="1230764">And the Government argued in that case and the lower court held none of the four had standing and yet, the Supreme Court just reversed per curiam without -- just asserting the fact they clearly had standing in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.530" offset="1285517">The -- one can deal with these issues in terms of the niceties of property law.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.590" offset="1305684">But in the question really, what are the -- what is the right of privacy a man has under the Fourth Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="308.904" offset="1339016">One of the District Court cases we cite, case from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia suggests that the question is whether it's unreasonable, if it's unreasonable to take these materials from this person, then that person should have a right to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.143" offset="1399933">Now, it's a circular test obviously and yet, it maybe a perfectly proper way of handling questions of -- which are often merely questions of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.228" offset="1440266">It seems to us quite clear that in the circumstances of this case, Jones had a right of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.735" offset="1462314">In this apartment, he had a right to keep out trespassers.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.957" offset="1475166">He had a right to keep out police without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.558" offset="1489586">He should clearly have standing to object to the unlawfulness of the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.614" offset="1513827">But the case really is considerably stronger than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.652" offset="1533994">What happened after the motion was denied was that it was repeated at the beginning at the trial and Judge Holtzoff said, “I am bound by what the previous judge had done on motion.”</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Henkin</label>
            <text syncTime="375.698" offset="1606196">And the Court said, "I am bound by that motion and didn't consider it."</text>
            <text syncTime="379.900" offset="1623019">Well, as we shall saw -- as we shall see -- we question whether that decision was correct, but we don't think it's important enough to stop on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.587" offset="1661680">After the Government's evidence was in, counsel asked again, and it appears in -- in the record on page 56, counsel asked again to note that we object to the inclusion of this Government's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.867" offset="1718836">And it was noted for the record and the Court didn't -- didn't affirm -- didn't grant the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.883" offset="1742869">Well, by this time, lots -- more evidence was before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.584" offset="1757706">By this time, the Government had introduced its whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.015" offset="1771395">It introduced evidence which said that he had been living in this apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.849" offset="1790725">It introduced evidence which said that he was in possession of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.819" offset="1806608">And not only introduced this evidence, but it must have proved it beyond a reasonable doubt, because these were the evidence in which this man was later convicted of possession, so that at least as to his relation to the narcotic seized, the evidence was “beyond a reasonable doubt that these were his”.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.243" offset="1868361">Well, the Government -- the Government doesn't deny any of this, but it seems to take the position that it came too late that once a motion is denied at the beginning of the trial, now, then, the Court needn't to stop in the course of the trial to reexamine this question.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.023" offset="2043486">We believe the Government is mistaken in its position as to what the trial judge should have done at this time and the answer seems clear on the basis of the Gouled case, which is cited in our brief on page 40 and 41.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.952" offset="2095208">And in fact, the entire portion of the Gouled case which is relevant to this point is quoted in that -- in that brief at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.555" offset="2133556">What happened -- this was -- came up on a certified question.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.666" offset="2150066">And the Court, in effect, said if there'd been a motion to deny, which was to suppress earlier, which had been denied, but it appeared in the course of the trial that the evidence was unconstitutionally seized should the trial court have stopped and examined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.820" offset="2218611">And the Court said quite clearly, “Sure, we don't want the trials interrupted, but that's only as -- rule of procedure and should not stand on the way of constitutional right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="538.662" offset="2258004">The -- the duty of the trial judge at that moment was as soon as it appeared probable, it don't have to appear certain, so it's appeared probable that it had been an unconstitutional seizure just to stop and see whether there had been an unconstitutional seizure.</text>

            <text syncTime="554.013" offset="2319444">And no one had suggested that the rules had been changed on any of these points, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.311" offset="2344626">In fact, the -- the question which the District Court had to decide at this moment, we believe, is one that could have take -- it didn't have to go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.260" offset="2380361">It didn't have to do anymore than spend 15 minutes looking at the affidavit and deciding whether to do what he had never done before which is look at that affidavit and decide, is it adequate for the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.261" offset="2420381">The Court didn't do that and the Gouled case and the Amos case decided the same day, seemed fairly clear to show that the Court -- if it -- if it exercised any discretion, which doesn't seem to be clear, abused him.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.082" offset="2475656">The Government cites one case in opposition and that is Segurola, cited in the government brief on page 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.491" offset="2517347">That's a very different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.986" offset="2523303">In Segurola, there was no motion to suppress the evidence before.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.046" offset="2543574">No objection before the trial at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.569" offset="2553605">And at the trial, the objection is made to the -- to the admission of the liquor had nothing to do with -- with search and seizure or -- or unlawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.542" offset="2597491">Afterwards, the man said -- the counsel said, “Well, in any event, we believe it should be suppressed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="630.264" offset="2624449">The Court said, “It's quite clearly, this motion is an afterthought and you come too late.”</text>
            <text syncTime="634.963" offset="2643257">That didn't happen in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.199" offset="2648168">Jones made his motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.632" offset="2657886">And the facts in support of that motion and they didn't appear at the time appeared during the course of the trial under Gouled names and we believe that the trial judge should have stopped and looked at the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.461" offset="2709191">The Government says in effect, “Yes, but it's different.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.103" offset="2719744">In Gouled, what appeared in the course of the trial was the unconstitutionality of the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.167" offset="2748061">Here, what appears in the course of the trial is the standing to raise the unconstitutionality."</text>
            <text syncTime="666.155" offset="2768018">We don't see why that should make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.349" offset="2776795">But in any event, the reason it didn't appear in the course of the trial that was unconstitutional is because we had never been allowed to prove that the warrant was bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.321" offset="2808665">If we assume, as we may assume for this probable case that the warrant was bad, there must be standing, appears all the elements necessary to prove unconstitutionality of either case.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.114" offset="2851819">There's still one further and perhaps the crucial issue in cases of this kind is the one to which Mr. Justice Harlan was referring before the lunch and recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.873" offset="2898840">These crimes are what we might call possession crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.362" offset="2916812">All the Government has to prove is possession.</text>

            <text syncTime="767.541" offset="3173543">He said in effect, “The right to object is -- to evidence is remedial.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.791" offset="3190575">It's -- it only amount with the constitutional -- with the constitutional privilege which is being infringed has a right to object and therefore, he must show this constitutional privilege."</text>

            <text syncTime="867.188" offset="3572172">If you read on the motion to suppress where the objection to the motion was lack of standing that Jones is minimizing his relation to the apartment, although it's in his interest on that motion to maximize it, the Government is trying to prove he had more relation to that apartment although on the motion, it was in its interest to minimize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.393" offset="3652942">And the reason -- the reason is, as the Government said quite clearly, “The cases show that if he makes this motion, either the motion or the affidavit can be introduced against him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="903.449" offset="3717204">What does this mean?</text>

            <text syncTime="1356.136" offset="5527907">But if you should find we have no standing, then the Court must face whether standing is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.505" offset="5545357">And on this -- as our brief argues, the standing notion is based on the -- as based on the idea that the whole purpose of the exclusionary rule is remedial, that is to make it up to the fellow whose rights had been deprived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.769" offset="5610454">In fact, the Government admits that "a -- a major purpose," I'm quoting, "a major purpose of this exclusionary rule is deterrence".</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.072" offset="5639711">Obviously, it will deter more if you also exclude not only in the case where a man has standing but also in the case where a man hasn't standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.947" offset="5671163">The time when -- when this rule of exclusion was what Mr. Wigmore called a terrible exception is long gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.493" offset="5697390">I suggest then -- and since the time when this rule is developed, another doctrine of this Court, the doctrine of McNabb and the cases which followed it, both notions of deterrence and discipline of the police and perhaps the notion that (Inaudible) which is we don't want our court soiled with dirty evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.000" offset="5767398">That the evidence is dirty no matter whose rights were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.317" offset="5780668">And if it should be necessary to reach that question, there is much to be said for Mr. Justice Traynor's opinion of the Court of Appeal -- for the Supreme Court of California in which he tries -- he -- he attempts to show that the whole motion of standing is based on a misinterpretation of the cases of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2618.158" offset="10576018">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.047" offset="10619591">At the outset, I understood counsel to remark that the Government had treated this case as though the prosecution admitted the warrant was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.979" offset="10699316">If he did say that -- in that -- in my understanding of it, I'm sure that it is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.901" offset="10730977">That has never been the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.073" offset="10747695">The Government's position in the trial court was simply this that the defendant did not have any standing to raise the question of the illegality of the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.541" offset="10809553">And that since the trial -- motion's trial judge held that no -- there was no standing, he never reached the question as to whether or not the warrant was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.861" offset="10866813">Now, the Court of Appeals, we think, must have at least considered that the warrant was valid because it went on to discuss the execution point, and that's the only basis, and I think you'll find it in our brief at page 35 of our belief that perhaps the -- the Court of Appeals did consider the validity of the warrant and consider it valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.235" offset="10984364">However, they made no mentioned of it and it isn't explicit in that Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.227" offset="11016234">I would like at the outset to try to get this case, the perspective of this case back to the way the case was tried at the trial level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.479" offset="11085302">It seems to me that the position was consistent to the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.250" offset="11112364">The Government -- the defendant first filed his pro se motion to dismiss in which it was discussed here before in which if the defendant did not deny possession of the narcotics and if he did not deny having made such use of the premises as to charge him with notice and knowledge of what the premises contain, he certainly did his best to convey that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.901" offset="11242977">And certainly, any prosecutor reading it would understand that this man is saying, “You haven't proved possession and I'm not admitting it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.914" offset="11282996">Now, he comes forth with his motion to suppress filed by counsel, the counsel who was argued the Jeffers case here, a very able attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.356" offset="11336808">And he made no mention of any standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.852" offset="11354781">His motion was based on the face of the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.090" offset="11375783">Find it was invalid because it had, in effect, been obtained through hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.813" offset="11414653">At the hearing on that motion, the Government raised the point with the motion's judge, Judge Laws and said, “The defendant has not shown that he has standing here to raise the question as to the illegality of the search.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.229" offset="11492289">At that point, without anything further, the defense lawyer didn't say, "Well, I don't have to prove standing” or “I can rely on the Government's allegations in its indictment or in its -- in its warrant or in its application for a warrant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.179" offset="11560103">He said, “I asked leave to a man to show that the defendant was present at the time on the premises at the time in question as an invitee or guest," so he immediately came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.349" offset="11628753">His -- his permission to a man was allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.042" offset="11639515">He is the attorney endorsed on the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.341" offset="11656756">And then he proceeded to put the defendant on the stand, and he was very particular that he did not want the defendant question by the Government as to innocence or guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.955" offset="11707225">Then he went right to the question of what right he had to be in the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.536" offset="11737527">And I believe that the defendant testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.290" offset="11764485">He said, “Whose place was it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.755" offset="11770441">Did you rent it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.713" offset="11774203">Did you pay rent or own it or anything?”</text>

            <text syncTime="5073.171" offset="20396074">Here, he's stating a fact whether or not a person has previously found to be reliable might be considered a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.679" offset="20430137">And I have no doubt if someone opposite circumstance could so argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5086.507" offset="20449364">But -- then let's see what the information was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.212" offset="20460231">The information was detailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5091.436" offset="20469112">It was detailed that the petitioner and Earline Richardson were involved in illicit narcotic traffic, that they kept a ready supply of heroin in what they had at that apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5103.585" offset="20517700">The apartment was designated by street number and by apartment number.</text>
            <text syncTime="5114.878" offset="20562840">It said, "Where the narcotics were kept?</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.473" offset="20573288">Under a pillow, on the person, on a dresser or on a window ledge?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.843" offset="20598784">That's pretty specific information.</text>
            <text syncTime="5127.454" offset="20613204">He said that the search that the source of information had made purchases at the apartment on many occasions the last time was August 20, which was the day before the warrant was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="5140.915" offset="20667016">It's pretty specific information.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.260" offset="20676420">It's a lot more than a tip.</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.214" offset="20692198">The tip might be that Jones is engaged in a narcotic traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.148" offset="20719992">That might be a tip or maybe that Jones and Richardson are selling narcotics but never really were in part.</text>

            <text syncTime="5277.254" offset="21212348">Besides that, the -- the warrant -- the application -- the affidavit shows on its face that there's some verification for this, that other sources of information, they'd received information from other sources the same as they had received from -- as he had received in the narcotics people and this Court had received from this particular source.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.747" offset="21338363">So, you have -- and he said, "The same information regarding the illicit narcotic traffic conducted by Cecil Jones and Earline Richardson has been given to the undersigned and other officers of the narcotics brought by other sources of information."</text>
            <text syncTime="5325.514" offset="21405445">So you have a specific, long specific detailed source of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.514" offset="21421432">You have other -- his sources of information, all of which confirm it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.234" offset="21440345">The question is, Is there a probable cause?</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.745" offset="21454346">Does he have a reasonable ground to believe that the narcotics are up there?</text>
            <text syncTime="5342.494" offset="21473364">Does he have a reasonable ground as a reasonable person to think that there's an offense against the laws of the United States?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5350.979" offset="21507323">If there's narcotics there, very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.474" offset="21517249">He has specific information.</text>
            <text syncTime="5355.515" offset="21525400">His information from the source has previously been -- been correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.994" offset="21547342">He has it confirmed by other sources, other sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.274" offset="21568449">Any of his knowledge that these people are addicts or they've been using narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5372.490" offset="21593318">That put it all together in looking at it in the policeman's knowledge, reasonable for him to -- to believe that the story that he's received is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.042" offset="21651519">And I think under those circumstances, any reasonable man would -- would have a basis for believing them the offense was committed, for believing that the narcotics were in that place.</text>
            <text syncTime="5397.978" offset="21695300">And the -- the judicial officer who scrutinized this document also was of the same opinion, had two men that thought that, reasonable man who came to that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5420.719" offset="21786206">I would like to -- I don't think the question is so much as to whether it was received, the warrant was issued on information, it might be hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="5433.206" offset="21836152">But what kind of hearsay?</text>
            <text syncTime="5435.482" offset="21845347">How reliable?</text>
            <text syncTime="5437.077" offset="21851721">How reasonable was the officer in relying on it?</text>
            <text syncTime="5442.105" offset="21871783">And I think in that case, that here, there are certainly -- certain indicia of truthfulness, a veracity enough to justify a man to rely upon that information and to act upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5457.432" offset="21933119">And I think that is all that probable cause requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="5464.411" offset="21961017">Now, the counsel did not reach the third part of this argument concerning the execution of the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.232" offset="22032280">Our brief does not raise the question of standing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5487.352" offset="22052760">Although, it might well had been raised as to whether he had standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.413" offset="22069060">But I would like to point out first that at no time did he specifically raise this question below.</text>
            <text syncTime="5502.268" offset="22112423">Although, he asked the necessary questions of his defendant and cross-examined the police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5510.527" offset="22145442">But he never raised the objection as the execution of this warrant was faulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5517.511" offset="22173445">And therefore, the Government never had notice of that objection, never had an opportunity to put other police officers on the stand who have accompanied Officer Didone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5531.893" offset="22230915">I believe there were three of them at least there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5535.267" offset="22244394">And so the -- the Government has no chance to corroborate what he had said about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5541.742" offset="22270307">And I think that under those circumstances, the least in this Court would do is to consider the evidence of the Government witness, Didone, as to what he said about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5554.705" offset="22322239">They considered whether or not testimony, the execution was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5562.501" offset="22353377">And it's submitted that -- on that testimony, the -- there was a compliance with 18 U.S.C. 3109 which provides as an officer may break into a home to execute a warrant if after notice of his authority and purpose, he has refused to admittance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5589.658" offset="22462046">Now, what these officers did was in effect get the defendant to open the door without having first disclosed their identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5602.639" offset="22513977">Regarding they opened the door, they first knocked several times and he asked, “Who's there?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5607.977" offset="22535293">They didn't answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5610.256" offset="22544384">He finally called out downstairs someone to get the janitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5614.384" offset="22560893">There are people at his door.</text>
            <text syncTime="5616.610" offset="22569775">One of the officers went downstairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5618.674" offset="22578030">He got the janitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5619.570" offset="22581687">They knocked again.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.357" offset="22588792">And when he called, “Who's there?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5623.191" offset="22596106">The janitor answered, “Janitor”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5626.335" offset="22608750">Therefore, the door was opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="5629.825" offset="22622647">And the -- you'll find the testimony of the officer on record page 37, "The door was opened three or four inches and he had a knife chain attached on the inside."</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.001" offset="22719404">The officer said, “I had my wallet opened with identification exposed and I've placed this inside the door saying I had a search warrant for the premise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5664.622" offset="22761827">They defend who had opened the door and was standing directly behind the partially opened door there, torn and went straight back to the bathroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="5673.969" offset="22799235">Then seeing he was refusing the entrance, I placed my hand on the chain and pulled the knife -- pulled the knife chains that loosed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5682.291" offset="22832567">So there, we have the announcement of this purpose obvious refusal of the defendant to grant him immediate entrance and thereafter of pulling of the chain and affecting a forcible entrance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.344" offset="22920756">We contend that the statute was complied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5710.330" offset="22944684">It did give notice of his authority in purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5714.637" offset="22961925">Again, you'll find that on cross-examination, his testimony on page 45 which he -- he said, “I identified myself as a police officer and said I have a search warrant."</text>
            <text syncTime="5728.261" offset="23016364">He recognized the defendant and he immediately turned and went back across the foyer to the bathroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="5736.129" offset="23047920">Well, the opinion of the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals seems to feel that the government officer should have announced their presence when they first -- in their identity when they first wrapped on the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="5752.977" offset="23115316">The Government thinks and believes that police officers and the cases where they're searching for evidence or things which are not evidence but things which have been used in the commission of the crime or contraband, he has a right to at least get the door open by means of some strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5771.477" offset="23189295">There was no -- to deliver and no lying here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5774.950" offset="23203192">They just knock, they didn't answer, unless say, of course, the petitioner's statement of what transpired various greatly and from that of the government witnesses.</text>
