            <text syncTime="27.238" offset="212302">I shall try to stay away from any repetition of matters that we have covered in connection with these cases and deal with the problems in regard to Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.338" offset="264756">I think it should be kept in mind that Louisiana was created like Alabama and Mississippi out of territories and they were creatures of the United States and as such the problems in regard to that are different than they would -- they are as to an independent country like Texas was prior to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.551" offset="385546">The claim was made that the boundary of Texas -- excuse me, of Louisiana was provided for as beginning three leagues in the Gulf at the Sabine River.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.253" offset="448345">That claim was made in their briefs and also in argument and we find no justification historically or in anyways just said that their boundary began at a point three leagues in the Gulf at the mouth of the River Sabine.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="108.512" offset="537370">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.679" offset="542072">Now, the Act just didn't provide for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.731" offset="566314">They also refer to the Treaty of 1819 with Spain.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.598" offset="593795">You will recall that we have been over the fact that the Treaty of Spain of 1819 was used by Texas in connection with the Treaty that made when she was an independent State as Republic of Texas in the agreement between the United States and Texas as to what her boundary would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.179" offset="668087">It was used as a basis for the -- both the same terms were used in the Treaty with Mexico in regard to boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.251" offset="712391">And on page 185 of the Government's brief, we set out the language of that Treaty in Article II, words indented defining the boundary between the United States and the area then belong to Spain because it was part of Mexico in 1819.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.706" offset="858154">The boundary line between the two countries, west of Mississippi, shall begin on the Gulf of Mexico at the mouth of the River Sabine in the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.746" offset="898382">There's nothing about three leagues at all continuing north along the western bank of that river.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.443" offset="925132">Well, that's just what the parties agreed at that time and they carried it down to the treaties that I have just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.865" offset="954807">Now, below on that page, close to the bottom, is the exact language that was used in connection with this survey that was described by counsel for Louisiana, Mr. Sachse in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.578" offset="1017710">And he said, “Well, of course, the surveyor couldn't walk on the water and put some marker out there.”</text>
            <text syncTime="234.315" offset="1040593">And so, he just didn't say anything about the three leagues in the sea that they were to have when he was marked the place that the boundary would start.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.912" offset="1083016">But under all practice of -- of surveyor, certainly, it -- he agreed he couldn't walk on the sea and he could have put up a marker of course but he wouldn't have to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.382" offset="1128887">He could've said in the language of his minutes like is often done by surveyors when they can't reach a certain point that if so many feet or miles or somewhat something else from this particular marker that the boundary starts.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.723" offset="1198268">But he said the -- boundary convention, what they agreed on was reestablish the point of the beginning of the boundary, the beginning of the boundary between the United States and the Republic of Texas at the mouth on the western bank of the junction of the River Sabine with the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.752" offset="1290428">There's nothing about three leagues if they ever put in to it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.347" offset="1308714">And certainly, it would seem reasonable that if they want to extend to three leagues, and if you recall that the convention provided that when they agreed on this boundary, it would be the same as though it was written in there as a part of the original agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.055" offset="1367542">But they said, “That was where the boundary began, at the sea.”</text>
            <text syncTime="323.843" offset="1398784">Now, on regard to the same problem you recall, counsel said that their boundary was conceived the sort of an extension of Texas boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.500" offset="1433370">So, they argued Texas boundary was three leagues validly such as a part of the argument of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.976" offset="1463254">You recall that during the argument of Texas case, they referred to the instructions to Mr. Trist who negotiated in regard to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and said that he was instructed to follow the statute of Texas of 1836.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.198" offset="1560116">Now, that is on page 102 of the Texas brief, the yellow brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.827" offset="1594702">And they set out at the bottom of the page there and they've indented it the language as to the instructions of Trist.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.518" offset="1649455">And I'm sorry that I was so late about getting this dug out because it impressed me that in going over and reading it again that that was an important consideration if this man who was to negotiate the treaty between Mexico and the United States that became Guadalupe Hidalgo was instructed to follow this particular statute and that's all there was to it that it was a major importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.112" offset="1763871">And they cited, as you will note, in the footnote certain papers of Mr. Trist that are in the library of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.256" offset="1788426">So, I ask one -- some of our staff to dig that out and see what -- what the fact was in regard to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.949" offset="1819146">And now, let's see what the fact was, what the instructions really were.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.069" offset="1839626">The notes there -- and this is not in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.492" offset="1849344">So, if you care to examine it further, you'll have to make a -- a note of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.709" offset="1870242">But I'll -- it's all revealed here if you check back against the papers that they cite in the notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.323" offset="1900648">I'm sorry that there is 211 pages of manuscript that's in longhand that Mr. Trist filed there as to the justifications for his action.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.601" offset="1953729">But he incorporates in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.932" offset="1963133">And there is no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.725" offset="1970239">The instructions to Mr. Sidwell as to what should be done in regard to the boundary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1071.426" offset="4389073">But it's -- no one has ever claimed on behalf of United States that we had any maritime boundary at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.084" offset="4423659">We claimed that those were islands belonged to United States such as there are and the three miles runs around them, just like they would run around the sea coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.795" offset="4462529">That's all has been in the position of the United States as it maritime boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.288" offset="4480502">It's also said that as to the Bering Sea that we receive a session or grant from Russia that included some of the sea for large distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.789" offset="4542568">But that just isn't born out by the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.946" offset="4555107">The grant itself was not for the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.951" offset="4587186">It said territory on the islands and continent and marked this as the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.426" offset="4621040">It didn't say any part of the sea and then there was an act in Congress where they tried to claim part of the sea, and the Congress rejected any such claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.307" offset="4664613">And then the Bering Sea arbitration proceedings, it was adjudicated that the United States had never claimed more than three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.885" offset="4706931">And that's the part of the decision of that arbitration that was binding upon the parties, and I think it was in a careful examination of the United States position and the history of it and all that happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.840" offset="4762728">So, there just isn't anything to that claim either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.786" offset="4782477">Now, it also said that with regard to Alaska, we claim the territory out 10 miles from the coast.But that isn't -- that is incorrect too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.570" offset="4837648">The fact is that the description is in regard to the 10 miles inland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.122" offset="4863875">And if you examine that description of the session, you will see that it described 10 miles inland and not seaward and the purpose was to take care of that area between British Columbia and the coast that we acquire in that session, and that just all there is to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.917" offset="4939003">It works out mathematically, the language describes it, there isn't any basis for the claim that we were making any kind of a claim for 10 miles seaward under that session and we never have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.889" offset="5054882">Now, the United States thinks that when the provision was made in the Enabling Act, hence, bounded by the said gulf to the place of beginning that that means that you run along the Gulf but you don't run out three leagues in order to determine what the territory of Louisiana was that came into the Union at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="4938.425" offset="19857115">Well, but I'm -- I'm trying to say, Mr. Justice, that the international law is which this Court said it would follow that they not only have to claim that boundary, this maritime boundary, but they have to occupy and take possession and prove it for a long enough period of time that it is recognized in the international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.938" offset="19939140">Now, you said, this very court, in Oklahoma against Texas, the 24 years was a very short time to be claiming a particular boundary to establish it as a matter of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4971.073" offset="19987623">You didn't pass on the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="5044.084" offset="20279672">But the -- the nine years period does nothing in international law to sustain such a short period as being sufficient to establish.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.887" offset="20314885">And the reason for that is dealt with and the authorities refer -- refer to where the courts have reasoned this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5059.519" offset="20341426">They say, “After all, our country doesn't look at all the statutes of another nation all the time and try to find out now with Russia.</text>

            <text syncTime="5090.839" offset="20466709">But you -- under international law, nations are busy, and they can't be expected to know every kind of statute that some country passes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.390" offset="20508923">So, you've got to bring it to their attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="5103.825" offset="20518640">After you bring it to their attention, you've got to occupy it and say “Now, if you -- you can't come in here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5109.665" offset="20542046">That's the other element.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.401" offset="20548942">And the only cases that we've pointed out to you are several law in one we can find that the -- roughly around 50 years and I think one, some 35 years that there was any -- and -- and there was real occupancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5125.358" offset="20604844">They had been occupying that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.399" offset="20616965">So, we don't think that that claim had any standing in international law.</text>

            <text syncTime="5651.801" offset="22710627">We stand squarely on the sole authority of Congress to authorize formation of a State to determine the territory that shall compose such State and by setting forth its boundaries and the exclusive right and power of Congress to see to any State title to possession, control and use of any territory or property that might belong to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.720" offset="22822222">Taking our stand on that position, we go to the Enabling Act of Congress in 1817 when Mississippi -- when you had the Mississippi territory and when it authorized the people of what constituted that part of Mississippi territory.</text>

            <text syncTime="5750.595" offset="23105703">That is the southern boundary line of the State of Mississippi as described in the Act -- Enabling Act, which was so well pointed out yesterday by Governor Daniel following the process of how a State might be bought.</text>

            <text syncTime="5768.975" offset="23179264">And in the use of six leagues, that was not pulled out of -- in the Act.</text>

          <turn speaker="spessard_l_holland" startTime="6324.652" stopTime="6664.685">
            <label>Mr. Spessard L. Holland</label>
            <text syncTime="6328.404" offset="25417017">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="6325.286" offset="25416913">That -- that is our coastline, the seaward side of those islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="6328.724" offset="25418271">They concede that, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="6334.479" offset="25441259">Therefore, I would point out to the Court in the very few minutes that I have left here that although Mississippi was not departed to the California and Texas cases, the Court held that the States own -- own it to the coast but further held that only the Congress could dispose of submerged lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="6350.947" offset="25507192">And I don't think it would be disputed or argued that the Submerged Lands Act was the result of the decision of this Honorable Court in the California and Texas cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6362.762" offset="25554422">That's all it brought it in to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="6365.408" offset="25564975">Now, I would like to call the Court's specific attention to the fact that the only time the word “leagues” are used in the Submerged Lands Act is when in dealing with the States bordering on the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="6379.288" offset="25620564">The others, it border on the two oceans, it says marks.</text>
            <text syncTime="6383.237" offset="25636342">And those bordering only Great Lakes, it says the international boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6387.935" offset="25655150">But, when it comes down to the Gulf of Mexico, what does it say in -- in describing the term “boundaries”?</text>
            <text syncTime="6396.522" offset="25689422">We don't have to go to the dictionary for the purposes of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6399.362" offset="25700812">All we have to do is read the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6402.417" offset="25713037">And it says but in no event shall the term “boundaries” or term “lands beneath navigable waters” being interpreted as extending from the coastline more than three geographical miles west in the Atlantic or the Pacific Ocean or three marine leagues until the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="6421.123" offset="25787852">And I submit that that it wasn't in either gesture on the part of Congress when they recognized three marine leagues into the Gulf of Mexico and if the distinguished Solicitor's argument is to be accepted by this Court, he is asking this Court to write out of this Act those specific provisions, and the Governor of Texas so ignored hereon yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="6443.118" offset="25875832">That very thing was attempted to be done when this bill was under consideration and twice the Senate refused to do it and wants the House of Representative refused to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6452.689" offset="25914180">I call the Court's attention to the entire spreading into Section 4 of this Act it so -- which says, “Nothing in this Section is to be construed as questioning or in any manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6463.858" offset="25958797">They're just seeing the existence of any state seaward boundary beyond three geographical miles if it was so provided by its constitutional laws prior to or at the time such State became a member of the Union or if it has been heretofore approved by Congress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6481.888" offset="26030895">And then following up, the Submerged Lands Act, we got the Continental Shelf Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6487.399" offset="26052942">Its been argued here that the -- the Government claim has no jurisdiction beyond these three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="6494.048" offset="26079587">And yet in Section 4 of the Submerged Lands Act, we find the United States Government say that the Constitution, laws and civil and political jurisdiction of the U.S. are hereby extended to the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf and to all artificial islands and fixed structures which maybe erected thereon to the same extent as if the outer Continental Shelf where an area of exclusive federal jurisdiction located within a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="6525.963" offset="26207274">And I submit, if Your Honor please, that with all deference, the letters from Secretary of State, with all deference to what somebody's foreign policy maybe at any particular time in the history of this nation, never has this Court held that foreign policy or letters of the Secretary of State can repeal a specific Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6551.554" offset="26309569">And that's what is almost attempted to prevail upon this Court to have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="6557.456" offset="26333184">That has never been the law, and I hope never is.</text>
            <text syncTime="6561.816" offset="26350634">The Act of Congress in dealing with these lands on the discussion is certainly the supreme law of this land and the one that we stand on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6571.727" offset="26390235">Now, I want to go back and repeat and then I'm through.</text>
            <text syncTime="6575.467" offset="26405282">We stand on our own Constitution of the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="6580.658" offset="26425971">We stand on the authority of Congress to convey that which belongs to the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="6587.736" offset="26454288">We stand on interpretation of the specific provisions of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6595.435" offset="26485112">It's not -- to me, it's not complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6598.670" offset="26498069">It boils down, as one of the justices asked here this morning, it simply boils down to what was the -- what was the boundary line of a State and what -- and what do you get from there under the terms of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6615.791" offset="26566510">We submit that under the California case, our coastline would give these islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="6622.414" offset="26593050">We accept that of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="6625.164" offset="26604022">And we submit that under this, that it is much as we will convey six leagues that we are entitled to -- to go all out the three leagues as conveyed by this Submerged Lands Act and what true of us is true of all the other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6643.664" offset="26678000">And I'd like to call the Court's attention one more time that the only time the word “league” is used in this Act is in dealing with the State's bordering on the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="6654.675" offset="26722095">In dealing with the others, it says “miles”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6657.526" offset="26733484">I thank the Court for the time you've given me.</text>
