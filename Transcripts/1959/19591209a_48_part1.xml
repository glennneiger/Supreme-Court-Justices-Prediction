            <label>Mr. Howard A. Heffron</label>
            <text syncTime="50.641" offset="305925">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.228" offset="324315">This case reaches this Court on a Government petition for certiorari to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.196" offset="376142">The action involves a suit by the United States for the collection of income taxes which were allegedly due and owing for the year 1946 in an amount just short of $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.652" offset="450017">After a full trial in the District Court, the district judge dismissed the suit on the merits, holding that it could not be maintained under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.913" offset="507068">The Ninth Circuit after hearing the appeal en banc affirmed that disposition, so that the ultimate question before this Court is whether this collection suit for the recovery of internal revenue taxes maybe maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.765" offset="594422">Now, in order to answer that question, we must first turn to the statute which provides that a collection action may not be maintained unless certain statutory formalities have been complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.436" offset="665161">Those statutory formalities relate to the matter of affording to the taxpayer an opportunity to go to the Tax Court and contest the merits of the asserted claim for taxes prior to payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.476" offset="741230">In this case, it is agreed that certain of the statutory formalities were not complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.075" offset="771636">To wit, the sending of the statutory notice, sometimes called the “90-day letter” provided in the Code, which formally advises the taxpayer that the Commissioner is asserting a deficiency in tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.896" offset="830986">That letter was not sent and the question is whether the Government was relieved of the statutory obligation of sending that letter by reason of a certain document filed by the taxpayer in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.797" offset="898591">Now, that document is called an 870 waiver and it's a piece of paper which provides that pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the restrictions provided in the Code are waived and consent is given to the assessment and collection of the following deficiencies in tax, which are then set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.971" offset="1003290">This document is signed by the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.016" offset="1019486">The sole question before this Court is the effect to be given to this waiver that the waiver is valid and binding as the Government contends, then the Commissioner was relieved of the obligation of sending a 90-day deficiency notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.841" offset="1098689">And in that event, the prohibitions against collection actions are not applicable and the suit maybe maintained, if on the other hand, as taxpayer contends, the waiver, as a matter of law, was ineffective to relieve the Commissioner of the obligation of providing the taxpayer with the 90-day deficiency notice as a prerequisite to assessment of the tax, then this action admittedly has been brought under circumstances in which this Internal Revenue Code provides, it may not be maintained, that is, the formalities would not have been complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.809" offset="1266604">In that event, the period for assessment having already expired, taxpayer will be relieved of this obligation and will have the action dismissed.</text>

            <text syncTime="310.906" offset="1346957">Well, under the provisions of the Code, as they stood at the time the Board of Tax Appeals was created, interest upon an amount asserted by the Commissioner as a deficiency, runs from the time the tax should have been paid until such time as there is in assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.565" offset="1449671">That is interest upon the deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.715" offset="1458239">Once there is an assessment, there is another provision which provides for interest upon the assessment, in the event, it is not paid with in the 10-day period provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.283" offset="1500453">The notice of deficiency is a procedural means whereby Congress created recourse to the Board of Tax Appeals for a review of the merits of the Government's asserted claim for taxes prior to payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.277" offset="1560430">And the statute provides that when the Commissioner is a -- asserting a deficiency in tax, and that the term, “deficiency” is itself define in the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.260" offset="1612361">In that event, he shall provide the taxpayer with a formal letter which notifies him of the assertion of that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.498" offset="1657396">When that letter is provided, the taxpayer has 90 days in which to petition the Tax Court for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.614" offset="1685817">He fails to petition within that period, then at the end of 90 days, the Commissioner may assess the tax and proceed to collect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.507" offset="1721448">He does petition the Tax Court, why then the assessment is delayed until the final determination of the Tax Court is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.362" offset="1752795">Now, under the provisions of the Code as they stood and as they stand today, interest runs during this entire process against the taxpayer on the amount which may ultimately be found one way or another to have been due, over and above that which he reported as due.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.660" offset="1821968">And in 1926, an amendment was enacted, the Internal Revenue Code, to provide the taxpayer with a means by which he could stop the running of interest against him, in the event, he did not wish to proceed by -- via the Tax Court route.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.963" offset="1911202">Provide a means whereby the restrictions upon the Commissioner which prohibited him from immediately assessing the tax until he had afforded the taxpayer an opportunity to go to the Tax Court could be waived.</text>

            <text syncTime="696.341" offset="2888704">So it's fair to say that there are literally thousands of tax returns and tax years which will be affected by this decision, as well as the determination of the Ninth Circuit holding as it did that an assessment could not follow upon a waiver of this kind, invites the -- the bringing of actions both to restrain the collection of taxes and the defensive actions on the same basis asserted here.</text>

            <text syncTime="769.249" offset="3180335">And it's the Government's position that restrictions means all restriction and that a 90-day letter, which is a prerequisite to assessing a tax, is as much a restriction upon assessing the tax as any of the other requirements and prohibitions set forth in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.202" offset="3252224">And further that the language of the Act which says, “At anytime the taxpayer may file a waiver,” means precisely what is says, “at anytime.”</text>
            <text syncTime="801.493" offset="3309380">Now, the -- the waiver provision was enacted as a result of this problem of interest, as it was conceived of at that time, the taxpayer was liable for interest from the date the tax should've been paid until the assessment and since the Commissioner at the time of the Revenue Act of 1926, which included this provision, had three years to assess in certain cases and four years in others, it is now three years, I might add under the 1939 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.565" offset="3453680">And since where the taxpayer files no return, as was the case here, the Commissioner has no statute of limitations upon assessment, that it was unfair in the case of a taxpayer who was acknowledging liability, to require him to wait until the taxpayer finished his administrative processing of the case and issued a 90-day letter and following it, an assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.649" offset="3561932">It was unfair that such a taxpayer require him to pay interest during this entire period when he had no desire to contest at this point.</text>

            <text syncTime="942.137" offset="3871953">He provides and states that the problem was at that time and it was assumed by Congress when it enacted this waiver provision that a voluntary payment might not stop the running of interest because there was no assessment, and in that event, it would not be a payment of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.843" offset="3946768">Consequently, the problem as envisioned at that time was to provide for immediate assessment, to give the taxpayer some way of being assured interest was stopped by giving him a means for consenting to assessment at once, without any of these restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.513" offset="4017403">You remember under the Code, Commissioner could not assess until he furnished this letter, then he had to wait for full 90 days or 60 days that it originally was.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.510" offset="4057422">During this entire period, interest ran whether the taxpayer was willing to settle his dispute with the Government or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.401" offset="4092949">The intention was to provide some means whereby the taxpayer in that position could stop the running of interest and the waiver provision here was tied in with a -- an amendment enacted at the same time which provided that the waiver should have the effect of stopping interest, 30 days after it was filed or if an assessment followed whichever period was sooner, so that a taxpayer was not desiring the contest on that, he could file a waiver, and interest stopped, 30 days later, no matter how long it took the Commissioner to get around to formally assessing the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.737" offset="4234324">He was afforded that protection and he could stop interest without himself losing the use of the money, which would be required, of course, if he made a voluntary payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.378" offset="4276851">The theory being until such time as the assessment followed, there was no payment of the tax, the taxpayer should not lose his right to this money.</text>

            <text syncTime="1093.686" offset="4478098">Well, of course, the -- or the Commissioner has three years to issue the 90-day letter or in the case of no return, an unlimited period to issue the 90-day letter, and once the 90-day letter is issued and the whole administrative procedure has culminated in this 90-day letter, for the taxpayer then to waive and stop interest 30 days later, gives him really the benefit of a savings perhaps of 30 days interest, because originally, the Commissioner was prohibited from assessing for a period of 60 days following the statutory letter, so that under the taxpayer's view, the Commissioner who before was restricted for 60 days from assessing and, therefore, interest run during this 60-day period under the taxpayer's view here, the waiver filed after this 60-day letter was sent would stop interest 30 days later.</text>

            <text syncTime="1522.019" offset="6191417">I suppose problem that presents itself to the Court is like the most problems that present themselves to men throughout their lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.858" offset="6222764">The result, well, to some extent, if not wholly depend upon the framework of reference within which you view it, or the set of perspectives with which one views it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.103" offset="6263829">In the presentation by counsel, great emphasis has been laid upon the fact that this is a situation where a taxpayer is not contesting liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.201" offset="6312208">First of all, I think that we would have to dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.899" offset="6334986">The waiver form which is involved in this case and the waiver form which is used by the Treasury in thousands of cases, is found in page 15 of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.518" offset="6385455">It states -- I'm sorry, may it please the Court, page 14 and page 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.035" offset="6407502">It states at the bottom of that form that the execution and filing of this waiver at the address shown in the accompanying letter, will expedite the adjustment of your tax liability as indicated above.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.580" offset="6461733">It is not however, a final closing agreement under Section 3760 of the Internal Revenue Code and does not therefore, preclude the assertion of a further deficiency in the matter provided by law, should've subsequently be determined that additional taxes due, nor does it extend the statutory period of limitation for refund, assessment or collection of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.758" offset="6594435">In other words, when a taxpayer has executed such a waiver form, this tax liability for the year has not been settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.645" offset="6625991">There are many cases in which the courts have sustained the Commissioner in asserting deficiencies and during a period beyond the execution of such a waiver.</text>
