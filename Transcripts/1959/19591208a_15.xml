            <text syncTime="18.793" offset="178552">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.022" offset="199450">As of March 18, 1956, the respondent union was faced with this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.811" offset="238634">The bargaining had reached an impact on an issue which posed fundamental issues of job security to its membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.190" offset="276146">The previous contract which had a no-strike clause specifying a series of activities barring the union from engaging in them had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.952" offset="331212">The union was faced with the alternative either of capitulating completely to the company on this fundamental issue or of taking some economic pressure action against the company to decide which of these activities specified in the contract was most effective under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.845" offset="422745">Confronting the respondent union with the nature of the employment and the nature of this industry, which I discussed yesterday, which are unique and which pose difficult problems for a union in that, there is direct economic benefit to the company to the employer in a complete strike situation, which there is not in any other industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.251" offset="540400">Confronted by this problem, the respondent decided to embark on a work without contract program.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.721" offset="570284">The primary ingredients of this were two.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.746" offset="582405">There were other ingredients the primary ones were two.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.995" offset="595362">One, the refusal to write new business through picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.054" offset="619604">First of all, so far as the new business is concerned, as we noted yesterday, these men are paid on a commission basis entirely so -- so far as new business is concerned, so that the result with respect to the new business was exactly the same as a complete strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.449" offset="689194">They received no pay for what they did not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.238" offset="708315">Secondly, as to the picketing, there was picketing in front of the company offices two or three days a week, one hour a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.472" offset="749275">There was distribution of leaflets during that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.492" offset="761292">There was request to the public for support to the distribution of petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.527" offset="781458">Now Mr. Manoli found that objectionable, the Board found that objectionable, it did not accord the picketing any special treatment, it indiscriminately lump the picketing together with every one of the other activities under what it regarded as harassing activities per se illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.236" offset="864319">Now I would say to Your Honors that it is an anomaly that picketing should be considered per se illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.416" offset="900995">It is not merely that it would seem obviously to be protected activity under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.598" offset="933804">More than that, Section 8 (c) of the Act gives affirmative express recognition to the public expression of views, to the public solicitation of support, and a glance at Section 8 (c) will demonstrate that that Section provides the cause and effect that Congress prohibited the Board, not only from finding any expression of opinion which was not a threat or a promise in unfair labor practice, but also from regarding any such expression even as evidence of unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.392" offset="1100988">Now the nature of the slogans that were used are in the record, it seems conceded by the Board, and it is plain on the face of the record that there was no threat or promise involved in any of the slogans, or placards, or appeals that respondent used.</text>

            <text syncTime="963.713" offset="3958262">Each of these activities, and they did, to some minor extent, change from week to week.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.030" offset="3991489">Each of these activities was known to the company under the stipulation of counsel and the finding of fact not contradicted by the trial examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.289" offset="4040495">It was known to the company before it took place, so that the company had the opportunity to make its plans on the basis of prior knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.332" offset="4092740">If Your Honors ask me, what is the significance of that fact?</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.888" offset="4106951">I say to Your Honors, that the Board in its brief suggests that the ability of the employer to plan accordingly is one of the criteria, which distinguish a strike which they would concede as legal from a strike which they would condemn as harassing and therefore per se illegal, so that we have satisfied the criterion which they themselves has put forward in their brief as a criterion for legal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.118" offset="4239862">The Board, in its decision -- and there are many differences between the Board decision and the Board brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.214" offset="4272253">The Board, in its decision, made no reference to this fact whatsoever but relied on a number of two cases particularly which had the element of prior notice absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.898" offset="4327006">And let me couple before I get to those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.158" offset="4339963">Another attribute of this record, not only there was prior notice of the nature of the activity, but it is undisputed on the record and found to the fact by the trial examiner, and not reversed by the Board that the company did know precisely what concession was necessary in order to produce the termination of these activities, so that you have prior notice, you have knowledge of the concession required to bring the activity to an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.210" offset="4480188">Those are present on this record, they were absent from the record in the Textile Workers case, which was cited by the Board in its decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.741" offset="4530343">They are absent from the record in the Automobile Workers case, which was cited by the Board and relied out here in the argument as authority at least for the not protected branch of the argument, so that you have those two distinctions which make this case, in effect again, satisfy the criteria used by the Board and yet condemned as per se illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.546" offset="4633579">Now there is a -- there is a further fact which distinguishes this case from both of those and that is that both in the Auto Workers court -- case, this Court and in the Textile Workers case, the Board found as a fact that the activities of the union had had substantial economic impact upon the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.295" offset="4736502">Now, in his argument here, Mr. Manoli has put that forward as a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.012" offset="4763460">He suggested that the company had lost many millions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.730" offset="4778297">There is no support for that record, not only the Board made no such finding, but the Board expressly declared that such a finding was irrelevant, it declined to make such a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.726" offset="4826258">It said that the impact of these activities on the employer was irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.046" offset="4851545">So that by the prior notice, the knowledge of the employer of the concessions required, the lack of a finding of substantial economic impact, we have clear-cut distinctions in our favor from the cases upon which the Board relied.</text>
