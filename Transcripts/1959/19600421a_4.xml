            <label>Mr. Lester P. Schoene</label>
            <text syncTime="24.099" offset="199764">And if the Court, please.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.847" offset="206764">This case is here as a result of the refusal of the courts of Georgia, to accept and to apply this Court's decision in Railway Employes' Department against Hanson, 351 U.S. 225.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.569" offset="273638">The case is here on appeal from a final judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia, which appears at the page 249 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.587" offset="309687">This Court's jurisdiction is based on Title 28 to the United States Code, Section 1257, paragraphs (1) and (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="64.905" offset="362977">The Court noted probable jurisdiction on October the 12th, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.622" offset="389831">Now, this action was begun in the Superior Court of Bibb County, Georgia in June of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.781" offset="438523">It was removed to the federal court and reposed there for about three and a half years while litigation in other similar cases including the Hanson case involving the same issues went forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.772" offset="514487">After this Court's decision in the Hanson case, we consented to it's remand to the Superior Court of Bibb County, Georgia where a motion to dismiss was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.251" offset="576345">I should say that in -- in this case, just as in the Hanson case, the nature of the action was an injunction suit to enjoin the performance of the union-shop agreement made under Section 2, Eleventh, of the Railway Labor Act and the agreements involved are entirely identical except for the name of the carrier to the agreement that was involved in the Hanson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.988" offset="675297">A motion to dismiss based on the Hanson case was filed immediately after its remand to the Superior Court of Bibb County.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.233" offset="708315">And on the day of the hearing of that motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs tendered an amendment to the complaint alleging that payments required to be made under the union-shop agreement would be used in substantial part to support ideological and political doctrines and political candidates that the plaintiffs were not willing to support.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.578" offset="817716">The Court allowed the amendment to be made, took the motion to dismiss as being addressed to the amended complaint and on the entirety of the Hanson case, dismissed the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.874" offset="870902">That decision was appealed to the Supreme Court of Georgia and in an opinion that appears at page 221 of the record, the Supreme Court of Georgia reversed the District Court indicating its complete disapproval of this Court's decision in the Hanson case, acknowledging that it was bound by it, but that it was willing to take any possible distinction to avoid applying it.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.613" offset="993782">As consequence to that reversal, the case was then tried in the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.418" offset="1025024">The facts as developed at the trial to the evidence are summarized, as you have undoubtably noticed, the record is a very voluminous one.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.234" offset="1072358">The -- the evidence is summarized in our brief at pages 11 to 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.607" offset="1105795">Very briefly, the evidence showed that the unions, in addition to their normal and predominant activity of negotiating and administering agreements and handling grievances, do engage through such institutions as the AFL-CIO, the Railway Labor Executives' Association in legislative, political, and educational activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.848" offset="1218748">And some individual unions have legislative representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.253" offset="1244348">They collectively participate in the publication of the Newspaper Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.332" offset="1268694">Individual unions publish magazines in the nature of house organs for distribution to their membership, which contained political and educational matter as well as reports concerning the activities and goings-on within the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.921" offset="1343091">And the evidence shows that the general funds of the unions from which such activities are financed do derive in substantial part from those in the initiation fees that the members pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.594" offset="1397739">There is no evidence of any assessment having been made by any defendant union for any purpose whatever, nor that any contributions has been required of anyone, for any purpose, other than the regular normal dues and initiation fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.751" offset="1486346">There is no evidence that anyone's conduct, or his expression or his belief has been in any way restrained or coerced or that anyone has been required to read anything or to listen to anything or to believe anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.927" offset="1571088">There is no claim that these expenditures involved are either ultra vires under the union's constitution or bylaws or unlawful under any federal or state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.064" offset="1631587">Now, it is our position and the sole point that I intend to argue that every issue in this case was disposed of by this Court's opinion and decision in the Hanson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.684" offset="1694072">That is discussed in our brief at pages 35 and following.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.075" offset="1727718">Now, we think in the first place that the Court's language, although the appellees pick certain language in the Hanson opinion out of context in the side that the issues here arising, were reserved in that opinion, we think the Court made it entirely clear that there was no violation of the constitutional rights through the mere expenditure of --</text>

            <text syncTime="439.821" offset="1862614">Comparing the pleadings in the Hanson case and the pleadings in this case, what issues, if any, were tendered in this case that by the pleadings were not before the various courts in the Hanson case?</text>

            <text syncTime="465.565" offset="1965641">I think, however, that this -- this is a substantially responsive answer to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.779" offset="1998451">That the -- I do not believe that the Hanson case had a specific allegation in the pleadings that these moneys were expended for political or legislative activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="493.573" offset="2077654">I think the amendment made in January 1957, when the motion to dismiss came on, was an addition, to substantially the pleadings that were in the Hanson case.</text>

            <text syncTime="519.457" offset="2181204">Mr. Schoene, was that amendment, was it not actually in language taken from the opinion of the Court?</text>

            <text syncTime="527.149" offset="2211924">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.540" offset="2217566">No, it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.182" offset="2220074">It used such -- it -- it used words like ideological and term -- which words were expected, but not in language from the -- from the Hanson opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.808" offset="2274617">This Court said in the Hanson case, “The only conditions to union membership authorized by Section 2, Eleventh, of the Railway Labor Act are the payment of periodic dues, initiation fees and assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.789" offset="2322578">The assessments that may be lawfully imposed do not include fines and penalties.”</text>
            <text syncTime="559.502" offset="2341386">The financial support required relates therefore to the work of the union in the realm of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.463" offset="2369181">No more precise allocation of union overhead to individual members seems to us to be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.020" offset="2395408">The prohibition of fines and penalties precludes the imposition of financial burdens for disciplinary purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.282" offset="2420485">If assessments are, in fact, imposed for the purposes not to mind the collective bargaining, a different problem would be presented and it is certainly indicated that the word, “assessments” was used in its precise meaning because the footnote to that sentence refers to constitutional provisions that are described as giving very broad powers of assessment.</text>

            <text syncTime="634.589" offset="2641690">Now, with respect to the First Amendment rights, this Court said in the Hanson case, "If -- if other conditions are in fact imposed or if the exaction of dues, initiation fees or assessments is used as a cover for forcing ideological conformity or other action in contravention of the First Amendment, this judgment will not prejudice the decision in that case."</text>
            <text syncTime="663.908" offset="2759032">Now, we submit that there is nothing to show that any imposition has been made or any exaction made other than the requirement for the payment of dues and initiation fees, and there has been no cover for anything, not a bit of evidence to indicate that any requirement of payment was used for anything other than to finance the regular activities of the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="722.915" offset="2995075">That it -- that -- that is a very definite implication of the Corrupt Practices Act and as I have stated, there is no claim here that either the Corrupt Practices Act or any other statute was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.670" offset="3042095">Now, if the language that I have referred through or to were not in itself determinative of what this Court decided in the Hanson case, it becomes perfectly apparent what this Court was doing in the Hanson case when you refer to this decision of the Supreme Court of Nebraska in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.186" offset="3120149">We have quoted on pages 35 to 36 of our brief what the Supreme Court of Nebraska said in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.721" offset="3166229">The Supreme Court of Nebraska held the statute unconstitutional precisely for the same reasons that the Supreme Court of Georgia has said it's unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.133" offset="3207920">Namely, they said, that assuming that it is proper to require every individual who gets the benefit of collective bargaining to contribute to the cost of collective bargaining, when you require union membership and require the payment of full dues and initiation fees, you are paying for something other because the union's engaged in other activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.943" offset="3311156">And that was the precise holding of the Supreme Court of Nebraska that was reversed by this Court in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.164" offset="3352012">Further, if you consult the record and the briefs before this Court in the Hanson case, you will find that the major contention before this Court was precisely the contention that the Supreme Court of Georgia has sustained in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.818" offset="3414601">We have set forth at pages 37 and 38 of our brief references to the record and briefs in the Hanson case showing that to be the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.023" offset="3471444">Not only, however, was this contention made in the argument before this Court in the Hanson case, after your decision came down, the counsel for the plaintiffs in that case apparently felt that you had overlooked the significance of these contributions or these expenditures for political and legislative purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.990" offset="3579382">So, they filed with you a motion to stay a mandate saying, "They were going to file a petition for rehearing," which could not be heard at that time and since the mandate would otherwise go down during vacation, they asked for a stay of mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.799" offset="3638523">Bringing these very arguments to your attention again, that motion to stay a mandate was denied on June 11, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.226" offset="3680319">The counsel for the -- for Hanson, nevertheless, filed the motion for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.561" offset="3709576">At same time, they proceeded in the Supreme Court of Nebraska with a motion to stay or with the motion to enter judgment on the mandate consisting of the retention of a limited injunction prohibiting precisely what the Supreme Court of Georgia has here said, cannot be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.821" offset="3806647">The Supreme Court of Nebraska received briefs and arguments on that motion and having heard it, determined that the mandate of this Court in the Hanson case required not the retention of a limited injunction, but a dismissal of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.930" offset="3871117">And on October, the -- on October, the -- no, I don't have the exact date, but it's in -- in October of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.300" offset="3928586">The Supreme Court of Nebraska entered its judgment on the mandate directing dismissal of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.559" offset="3957635">In the meantime, on October 8, of that same year, which I believe was the first day the Court was in session in that time you denied the motion for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.511" offset="4005386">Now, similarly, efforts to construe the Hanson case as the Supreme Court of Georgia had construed it, were made in Moore against the C&amp;O Railroad Company, reported at 198 Virginia 273 where a motion for rehearing based on the motion for rehearing pending in this Court and the Hanson case was made that that was denied by the Supreme Court of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.418" offset="4125027">In Sandsberry against International Association of Machinists, 295 S.W. 2d 412 in which you denied certiorari 353 U.S. 918, the same matters were brought to the attention of the Supreme Court of Texas and the Supreme Court of Texas concluded that this Court had full cognizance of all of these facts relating to the nature of the activities and the nature of the expenditures that unions make at the time it decided the Hanson case and had authoritatively disposed of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.714" offset="4274239">Finally, in a more recent case, Allen against Southern Railway Company involving these same agreements on the same railroad, the Supreme Court of North Carolina at 259 N.C. 491 made an analysis of the decision in the Hanson case and we quote at page 42 of our brief from what the Supreme Court of North Carolina concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.733" offset="4394297">The Court there said “the very questions now raised by plaintiffs were before the Court and decided in Hanson and that the words upon which plaintiffs rely when read in context do not support their contention.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.140" offset="4459917">Now, I must say that that decision of the Supreme Court of North Carolina was rendered after the first appeal in this case and with knowledge of what the Supreme Court of Georgia had said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.312" offset="4520626">However, following the second appeal, it has granted a motion for reconsideration and has not yet decided on that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.613" offset="4565870">It is under consideration by the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.087" offset="4579767">Now, that is the only point I'm going to argue when my colleague, Mr. Kramer, will discuss further issues on the assumption that everything I have said is wrong and that the Hanson case has not disposed of the issues here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1140.741" offset="4666284">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.331" offset="4680704">We submit of course that the Court need reach no further issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.605" offset="4693765">That the Hanson case is fully dispositive of every contention raised by the appellees; that is, the individual appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.406" offset="4728978">But if it is not dispositive of the case in its entirety, then what do we have here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.076" offset="4755728">We have an Act of Congress adding Section 2, Eleventh, to the Railway Labor Act which did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.085" offset="4791672">First, it repealed in part the congressional prohibition of a union shop in the railroad and airline industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.128" offset="4827930">Now, I take it there can be no serious question of the power of Congress to repeal its own prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.972" offset="4859277">The second thing that that Act did was expressly to declare the congressional intention to supersede any state laws that might limit or prohibit a union shop in the railroad and airline industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.533" offset="4925524">Now, the appellees say that somehow that second purpose was not accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.297" offset="4948511">That Congress with Section 2, Eleventh, was ineffective to supersede state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.065" offset="4975679">Now, let us assume for a moment that that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.947" offset="4987173">I will just show next, that it is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.863" offset="4994800">But assume for a moment that it is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.970" offset="5007235">Then what do we have?</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.610" offset="5013817">We have no federal prohibition of a union shop, and we likewise have no state prohibition of a union shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.854" offset="5050807">So the union shop would mean we would still be valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.135" offset="5059897">Now, Georgia has a right to work on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.617" offset="5073795">The Court below, at least the trial court and by implication of the Supreme Court of Georgia held that a union-shop agreement violates state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.207" offset="5112247">That would appear to be a state question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.640" offset="5125935">The determination of which by the Supreme Court of a State would be taken as conclusive by this Court, but always subject to the requirement of due process and equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.226" offset="5172328">The Court below said that it violates this -- the law of Georgia but they cited nothing, no case, no statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.886" offset="5202944">Now there was no case squarely in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.799" offset="5214542">All the Georgia cases that involved the union shop assumed that a union shop was valid, both the Court and the litigants assumed it was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.360" offset="5256861">And, of course, basically the union-shop agreement is valid at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.245" offset="5276400">The most complete discussion of that that I know of is in Hudson against the Atlantic Coastline Railroad in 242 N.C. Georgia enacted a right to work law in the late 1940s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.106" offset="5335751">If a union shop were invalid there you wouldn't have needed such an Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.913" offset="5351006">But suppose we assume that the statute was declaratory of the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.939" offset="5371173">If so, it was declaratory of what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.641" offset="5381935">The statute specifically accepts the railroad industry and the airline industry from its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.696" offset="5406177">The statute specifically says, “A union shop or a closed shop is unlawful except when entered into between an employer and an organization subject to the Railway Labor Act, as the Railway Labor Act may be amended from time to time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2039.704" offset="8262196">Here, all that Congress did was not prohibit an agreement, so providing, as saying state law shall not apply to the validity of that agreement, or similarly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.629" offset="8301902">If Congress were to enact a statute, providing that a locomotive engineer, let's say, shall get paid a stated number of dollars for each 150 miles in passenger service or each of a hundred miles in freight service, or eight hours whichever comes sooner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2104.884" offset="8522898">The Government did very little.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.972" offset="8531257">Now the plaintiffs, the appellees argue that there's other kinds of government action here besides legislative but I think we can just go to that quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.552" offset="8565530">They say that there was executive government action, because the union-shop agreement came about after mediation and after an emergency board made a report to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.998" offset="8611401">And they say that, therefore, the Executive Department influenced the entering into of this contract and therefore you'd have this validity as though the government had ordered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.728" offset="8654242">Well, I submit but it's simply nonsense to argue, that a contract which would be valid if entered into without mediation, is tested by a different standard of validity if entered into after mediation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.732" offset="8710248">This just makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.661" offset="8717981">They also argue that there's judicial government action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.105" offset="8731773">They tried to rely on Shelley against Kraemer, obviously misplaced because nobody, none of the unions here is asking any court to enforce any agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.559" offset="8769599">So if there were anything to Shelley against Kraemer point, it is much too premature even to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.719" offset="8802200">In considering government action also, you must look at what is the complainant's complaining about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.959" offset="8827173">They rely heavily on two dissenting opinions in this Court, Pollack against the Public Utilities Commission, and the Black against Cutter Laboratories 351 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.351" offset="8880776">Now if we assume those dissenting opinions to express the law, let's see what happened to the complaining party there and what happened to the complaining party here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.584" offset="8917661">Mr. Pollack could not ride Washington's buses without listening to the radio.</text>

            <text syncTime="4438.601" offset="17857808">I was interested in the brief which was filed amicus curiae by the AFL-CIO in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4446.541" offset="17889573">They seem to take the bold position that politics is the main business of unionism and that it must continue to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.117" offset="17971806">We take the position that the rights about saved by the First Amendment and the other amendments of the Bill of Rights are absolute rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.203" offset="18028231">We further take the position that there is no agonizing alternative confronting this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.444" offset="18073161">Sometimes, I know two great principles compete with each other for recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.243" offset="18100328">We don't have that situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.736" offset="18122271">We are not here fighting in any way trade unionism.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.547" offset="18141602">We're haven't the slightest quarrel to make with the institution of trade unionism which certainly has been accepted as a part of the American life.</text>
            <text syncTime="4519.600" offset="18181726">We do say that, in this particular, trade unionism needs some advice to protect it against its own folly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4539.035" offset="18259466">If this practice which they so boldly admit, is sanctioned here, it would mean that there would be no end to where certain losses might lead labor unions of divided settlement as I mentioned a while ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4564.132" offset="18359881">The evidence is undisputed here that they have no referendum that the decisions on candidates, the decisions on measures, on me, by the individuals and the committees at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4581.827" offset="18430725">AFL-CIO says an adverse decision might in effect compel all these unions either to give up the union-shop or to abandon their tradition on ascension activities in the political and legislative views.</text>
            <text syncTime="4594.738" offset="18482343">I see no reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4597.803" offset="18494568">They have asked the Government and over a period of years, the Government has made them trustees of government policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4608.160" offset="18536051">The Government through a complex of numerous laws including the Railway Labor Act had designated these unions as instruments of government policy, have given them a governmental dignity, have made them trustees of certain rights and obligation not only to themselves but to society at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.759" offset="18646392">If they desired to at making this contract, to become that trustee, we ask them to discharge their obligations under the trust in accordance with the spirit of the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.439" offset="18717132">We are not trying to interfere with any voluntary associations whether they would be bar associations or labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.486" offset="18753285">Somewhere in here, the AFL-CIO makes a remark like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.748" offset="18778363">They say, “Yes, the Government helped us, the Government forces you to come in and join and pay us this money, but we are a private officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.924" offset="18819114">There's no law.</text>

            <text syncTime="4681.646" offset="18829981">There's no anybody who can tell us what we do with this money when we get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.808" offset="18854640">That's stated in here two or three times and I won't have the time to find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.831" offset="18870732">Now I say that's a dangerous state of mind to be in for the salvation of labor itself, the Constitution ought to be brought in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.535" offset="18921514">When -- when an agency accepts a governmental status, it accepts the inhibitions of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.746" offset="18966340">Here are some words that interested me in the AFL-CIO document page 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.792" offset="18990582">As was said by a political philosopher whose credentials antedate date even those of this Court, “A state arises out of the needs of mankind.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4735.254" offset="19044394">Now, he goes on and says, “To determine the proper objects of this “Labor State” or specialized government instrumentality which we are now assuming a union is and to determine what they reasonably be selected to attain these objects, one must look to the needs of the labor in there.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4759.901" offset="19142928">I want to say here that this Court has never been quick to whittle away the fundamental rights in the First Amendment for every passing breeze.</text>

            <text syncTime="5762.272" offset="23152410">To have not only free religion and I might say then just a word, the statute of Virginia for religious freedom was formulated by James Madison and passed in 1785.</text>

            <text syncTime="5782.113" offset="23231822">And I think we are all familiar with that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="5787.322" offset="23252616">I say that it is possible in this case to stand up as this Court has stood up on many occasions in recent years and in times further past, for the oppressed individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.041" offset="23327535">It's possible to stand up for the oppressed individual here.</text>

            <text syncTime="5817.344" offset="23372779">I'm bringing here six people who represent or stand in the place of many others who ask that their rights under the First Amendment remain unimpaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="5831.694" offset="23430144">That whatever declarations by this Court whether unnecessary be made, and that it will be made clear to organize labor which serves a great function in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5845.146" offset="23483956">That if they want to practice politics, they should go outside of the Government to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5851.376" offset="23508825">Certainly the Government has even gone so far as to see that an exemption to a man who would sign a non-communist oath is an unfair advantage compelling him to say something that he might not otherwise want to say but when he wanted to remain silent.</text>

            <text syncTime="6406.163" offset="25727979">Now, it is true that that action was brought before the union-shop agreement had actually become effective and consequently an injunction issued in the Nebraska courts before there was any opportunity to show that individual persons had been required to join the union and their particular money had been used for any of these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6427.035" offset="25811466">But the record in the Hanson case did show the constitutions and bylaws of the unions and showed their authorization for making such expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="6438.862" offset="25858800">It showed the nature of the Newspaper Labor on the extent to which it engages in political activity and it showed the relationship of that newspaper to these organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6449.378" offset="25900910">On the basis of the record as it stood in the Hanson case, the Supreme Court of Nebraska said, this is particularly true as to whether the latter because it is apparent that some of these labor organizations advocate political ideas, support political candidates and advice national economic concepts which may or may not be of an employee's choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6476.547" offset="26009579">It further said a little later on by requiring him to pay initiation fees, dues and assessments, he is required to pay for many things besides the cost of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="6489.077" offset="26059630">To -- a little later on to require all employees receiving benefits from collective bargaining agreements to pay the labor organizations obtaining them, initiation fees, dues and assessments is to require them to make contributions to any and all of the varied objects and undertakings in which such labor organizations are or may become engaged and which have no substantial relation to the object here sought to be obtained.</text>

            <text syncTime="6597.527" offset="26493471">That problem meant -- that Congress endeavored to safeguard against that possibility by making explicit that no conditions to membership may be required except as respects periodic dues, initiation fees and assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="6614.613" offset="26561808">If other conditions are in fact imposed or if the exaction of dues, initiation fees or assessments is used as a cover for forcing ideological conformity or other action in contravention of the First Amendment, this judgment will not prejudice the decision in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6636.608" offset="26649788">How I read that domain for example, but if Mr. Gambrell points out, he has copies of oath and obligations that individuals might be required to take in order to join a union, if those are imposed as conditions and addition for the payment of initiation fees, dues and assessments, then a different question is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="6659.823" offset="26742680">And we have no instance here, no evidence of anyone being required to take any other any sort of oath, go through any kind of ceremony or express himself in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6673.487" offset="26797328">All that is shown is that they are required to pay the dues, fees and the assessments regularly required as a condition of obtaining or retaining membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="6685.591" offset="26845706">And that I read the Hanson case, as having held does not give rise to any constitutional infringements under the First or the Fifth Amendment because certainly it was brought to the attention of the Court, not only what the Nebraska Supreme Court had decided but that these moneys were used in these ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="6716.079" offset="26967646">It was not only -- we have included in our brief at page 37 references to the record and to the brief in which those things were presented to this Court, not only in the initial argument, but as I stated earlier in the -- in the motion to stay the mandate and again in the petition for rehearing and then the same contention was made to the Supreme Court of Nebraska that these issues had been left open and that therefore a limited injunction should be put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6747.653" offset="27093974">And you denied them the motion to stay a mandate, you denied the petition for rehearing, and the Supreme Court of Nebraska ordered the case dismissed.</text>

            <text syncTime="6827.295" offset="27412564">The Court said the rules and bylaws of the state bar as approved by this Court do not compel the plaintiff to associate with anyone.</text>

            <text syncTime="6840.012" offset="27463450">The only compulsion to which he has been subjected by the integration of the bar is the payment of the annual dues of $15 per year.</text>

            <text syncTime="6858.931" offset="27539101">Now, that is just as true of a member of the union that is required to belong under a union-shop as it is of members of the state bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="6871.227" offset="27588315">And while the bar may be a different profession from a common calling as I submit that members of the bar of justice, has definite First Amendment rights as railroad employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="6885.458" offset="27645158">Again in the same decision the -- that the Court said the plaintiff balanced his argument that the compulsory dues of the state bar do impinge upon First Amendment freedoms on the fact that the state bar does take a stand on legislation pending before the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="6901.202" offset="27708165">He points out that he personally is opposed to some of the legislations supported by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6905.570" offset="27725615">Because of this, he contends his right as guaranteed from the First Amendment, were violated because part of his dues money is used to support causes to which he is opposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6916.521" offset="27769501">Whatever activity in the legislative field in which state bar does engage is limited by its rules and bylaws promulgated by the Court to all the standing committees and so on.</text>
