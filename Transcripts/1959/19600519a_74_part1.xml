            <label>Mr. Peter T. Beardsley</label>
            <text syncTime="13.044" offset="155564">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.114" offset="171865">This case is an appeal from a decision of a three-judge court for the District of Columbia which dismissed our complaint to set aside a report and order of the Interstate Commerce Commission on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.707" offset="222229">First, on the merits, second, the Court said -- or two of the three judges said that the plaintiffs had no standing to bring this suit to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.348" offset="260786">The report and order, which is involved here, authorizes Pacific Motor Trucking Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the -- of the Southern Pacific railroad to perform unrestricted motor carrier service from three California General Motors assembly plants, are set forth in detail in the appendix to the Commission's report which is printed at page 39 of the record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.401" offset="357021">The appellants are six independent motor carriers, four common -- four common carriers and two contract carriers and three carrier associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.962" offset="399235">The status of these independent carriers, their ICC authority and their testimony regarding their willingness and ability to serve General Motors is set forth in Appendix B of our brief on the merits here.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.973" offset="459316">We believe the Commission aired in the following manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.064" offset="475617">First in authorizing the rail subsidiary to perform service not restricted the so-called auxiliary and supplemental operations in view of its specific finding in this case that there was no showing of unusual circumstances here.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.681" offset="534131">We also believed that the Commission's report and order here violates the so-called dual authority provisions of Section 210 of the Interstate Commerce Act, which of course is Section 310 or 49 U.S.C. Annotated.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.298" offset="588570">We think the court below compounded the Commission's error, so to speak, in holding contrary to the Commission, that special circumstances justified the Commission's action in holding that the plaintiffs had no standing to bring this suit and in attaching any significance at all to the amendments made in 1957 to Section 209 of the Interstate Commerce Act, dealing with applications to perform contract carrier service.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.193" offset="700165">And both of the Commission's reports which -- which are printed in the record here, one of them commencing at page 8 and the other at 54, there, the heading of Sub 34.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.651" offset="741961">Although you will note from the authority sought in these various applications in which is set out in our brief at page 5, that the Sub 34 case involved relatively minor authority compared with that which was sought in the Sub 37 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.064" offset="803610">This proceeding really started out as four separate applications before the Commission, Sub 34 through 37.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.059" offset="835584">After the Commission's first report in the Sub 34 case and while the other three cases were pending before it, it granted petitions for reconsideration of its Sub 34 report and consolidated all the four cases into one proceeding and it is with respect to its consolidated report which is dated September 9, 1958 and commencing at page 8 of the record when our complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.638" offset="937880">Coming immediately to what we think is the most important error committed by the Commission here is our belief that it does violence to this Court's very recent decision in a so-called, ATA case, American Trucking Associations v. United States and ICC, which is reported at 355 U.S. 141.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.335" offset="1028681">That case involved an application filed under Section 207 of the Act which deals with applications to perform common carrier service.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.992" offset="1063372">This proceeding involves an application filed under Section 209 dealing (Inaudible) but the Commission's report conceives and for once, we agree with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.343" offset="1104750">They then so far as grants of motor rights to railroads or their subsidiaries are concerned, the same principle applies regardless of the type of carrier it sought to be performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.046" offset="1151561">If I may very briefly, I just like to review the ATA case.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.490" offset="1173295">That involved an application by a subsidiary, the Rock Island railroad to the Commission, seeking unrestricted authority essentially between Omaha and Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.887" offset="1214882">Now, in that case, the independent motor carriers, who were protestants before the Commission and appellants here, urged that the proviso of Section 5 (2) (b) of the Act, which is directly applicable in Purchase cases, and which in effect, requires that railroads maybe authorized to perform only what has come to be known as auxiliary and supplemental service.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.799" offset="1314565">They urge there that those provisions of 5 (2) (b) had to be read into Section 207 because it should be pretty obvious that if the railroad can do on the one hand what it can't do on the other, the restriction in the first instances is of very little value.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.001" offset="1379349">The Commission held, however, that in the 207 case, where we were asking that that language be read in and in where it was not directly applicable, the Commission said that where exceptional circumstances prevailed as it found they did there, it was entitled to issue in a 207 proceeding, a -- an unrestricted certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.731" offset="1466284">Now, the exceptional circumstances which the Commission found in that case were that the independent motor carriers who were protestants before the Commission, had failed to provide adequate service to the small aisle or points involved between Chicago on the one hand and Omaha on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.600" offset="1541726">In fact, the Commission went even further and made what amounted to a finding of willful failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.040" offset="1563564">It said they had provided the service only where it suited their convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.024" offset="1583417">Now, that Commission finding respecting what I call the willful failure, the independent carriers in that case to provide service was upheld both in the District Court and in this Court and the holding was that (Inaudible) policy underlying Section 5 (2) (b), ordinarily has to be applied even in Section 207 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.042" offset="1675577">The Commission can, in exceptional circumstances, grant unrestricted authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.061" offset="1699610">And in your decision in the ATA case, you referred to your prior decision in the Texas and Pacific case and the Rock Island case, back in 1951, and you said this and I'm quoting now from your decision at 355 U.S. 151, 152, “We repeat, as we said in those cases, that the underlying policy of 5 (2) (b) must not be divorced from proceedings for new certificates under Section 207.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.061" offset="1827610">Indeed the Commission must take cognizance of the National Transportation Policy and apply the Act as a whole, but for reasons we have stated, we do not believe that the Commission acts beyond its statutory authority, when in the public interest, it occasionally departs from the auxiliary and supplementary limitations in a Section 207 proceeding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="453.605" offset="1917785">I would like to concur as the factual situation.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="456.697" offset="1930115">Did the Commission ignore the ATA case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter T. Beardsley</label>
            <text syncTime="459.994" offset="1943385">We think they did, sir.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="460.836" stopTime="462.370">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="460.836" offset="1946728">Well I mean did it refer to it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_t_beardsley" startTime="462.370" stopTime="544.009">
            <label>Mr. Peter T. Beardsley</label>
            <text syncTime="462.370" offset="1952893">It referred to it because I see that more or less tipped its head in passing by, but it -- it did not follow what I think on the clear guidepost laid down by ATA case.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.763" offset="1990405">Of course that's the nub of this argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.785" offset="2010467">In this instance, in this proceeding, far from being unwilling to provide service as was a case in the ATA case, if prostesting motor carriers here have been literally banging on General Motors' door for years in unclean effort to get some of their trucking, only to be given a very cold shoulder, they had been able to attain some traffic out of these General Motors plants in instances in which the automobiles involved had been bought and paid for by the Government and in which the Government pays the freight and control of the traffic, but that is all.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.774" offset="2146513">You might say to paraphrase a -- well, a well-known statement that this is one instance in which what's good for the Government isn't good for General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.178" offset="2188100">But again and I think it of utmost importance to know that here, in a very striking contrast to its situation in the ATA case, there were no in advocacies shown at all in the service of the independent motor carriers, rather their failure to handle any of these General Motors traffic is simply as Commissioner Murphy said dissenting here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter T. Beardsley</label>
            <text syncTime="1198.189" offset="4896162">Well, I can't frankly recall right now, what we proposed, but what I would say is this that when you do read the record, you will have no doubt in your mind from what the Commission says about our contentions as to what we were asking it to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.935" offset="4951124">Now, before I come to the Commission's rationale underlying its grant of this unrestricted authority here, I want to go back a minute to what it said in the case before it which ultimately became the sub nomine this Court, the ATA case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.362" offset="5016848">That's the issue and that's the case in which the Rock Island was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.011" offset="5031372">The Commission in that case prefer to its policy of imposing five so-called auxiliary and supplemental restrictions in grants of authority at the railroads or their affiliates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.213" offset="5072227">And it said this, “This policy was and is sound and should be relaxed only where the circumstances clearly establish first, that the grant of authority has not resulted and probably will not result in the undue restraint of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.130" offset="5131891">And second, that the public interest requires the proposed operation which the authorized independent motor carriers have not furnished except where it suited their convenience.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.496" offset="5177344">Notice the Commissions report here does nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.360" offset="5188838">We submit that it attest to its rather short memory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.110" offset="5207855">It made the first finding, I just referred to even though its report here perpetuates and broadens the monopoly which already exist that these General Motors plants and which is enjoyed by the Southern Pacific Rail Motor combined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.611" offset="5269817">But it couldn't make the second finding regarding the failure of independent motor carrier to furnish service, because as I stated, the independent carriers here are willing, ready, able, indeed, anxious to do business with General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.829" offset="5322689">Nevertheless, the Commission wants a hand and it relaxed its policy in this case to precisely the same extent as it did in the ATA policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.918" offset="5359052">And in doing this, it made these two observations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.072" offset="5371695">First, it said it couldn't impose the usual restrictions in this case because if it did so, it would be authorizing common rather than contract carriage, which had been applied for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.133" offset="5419865">Now, as we point out on brief, the Commission hasn't been nearly as solicitous when independent motor carriers had been before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.527" offset="5449435">It has often issued one type of authority when another has been requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.340" offset="5468766">And as we also point out and the Commission agrees with us in its brief, at page 21 of its brief, that there's little distinction between common and contract carriers in the automobile transport field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.279" offset="5512443">Plus the Commission here could well have authorized PMT to provide a common carrier service and having done that, it could've imposed restrictions designed to limit that service to auxiliary and supplemental operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.084" offset="5563747">Now, they admitted that kind of authority would not have been acceptable with General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.434" offset="5585063">And in the final analysis, we contend that the Commission simply bowed its neck and did what General Motors wanted it to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.478" offset="5613275">Now, the other reason which the Commission gives to justify its departure from its usual policy, despite its finding that no unusual circumstances had been shown, is really all we're doing here is simply allowing the Southern Pacific Railroad to transport the use of motor trucks in the service, to transport automobiles where it has formally used its railcars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.736" offset="5706271">Well now, this philosophy I think will completely emasculate the congressional policy that's involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.612" offset="5733857">After all, if all the railroad has to do in order to get motor truck authority, all along its line, is simply to show that it's presently moving traffic in railcars and every railroad in the country is in business as a motor carrier to points all over its system without any restrictions at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.737" offset="5806268">And every railroad in the -- railroad in the country could pick its largest shippers and its choicest traffic and simply go into the motor carrier business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.738" offset="5838346">Now, if that's all this Congressional policy needs, there's been a lot of water over the dam over something that doesn't to a hill of beans in the final analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.060" offset="5879620">We think it means a lot more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.745" offset="5890382">Really, in the final analysis, here's what the Commissions order tells the railroads of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.388" offset="5912952">It says first, if you can prove on all the ATA case, that the independent motor carriers in the area in which you want to perform unrestricted trucking, are dodging their responsibilities, failing to provide inadequate service, come in and file a common carrier application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.815" offset="5978676">And on the basis of that case, we will be able to give you unrestricted rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.712" offset="5998216">But it says on the other hand, if you can't show that the independents are -- are doing a poor job, if they appear to be rendering inadequate service, why come in and ask for contract carrier rights and we will give you those unrestricted, because we wouldn't want to attach restrictions to those kind of rights because then we -- making common carriers out of you and we shouldn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.171" offset="6084106">And as we read this case, the Commission in a very real sense has simply consigned the congressional policy here in the limbo and certainly not because of any change in the law at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.945" offset="6131127">Now, the argument is made on brief and it's going to be made across before the Court that in reality, the authority has -- has been granted is restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.353" offset="6176789">PMT and General Motors and their joint brief, even go so far as to say that the territorial limitation imposed by the Commission amounts to an auxiliary and supplemental restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.180" offset="6220048">But we think that the term is too well-known in the court decisions and we think it means that the operations have to be tied in with the rail service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.979" offset="6267277">And for that reason, we think that claim by General Motors and PMT simply doesn't hold water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.463" offset="6293191">But further of what the Commission refers to as a territorial limitation is a restriction or not, we certainly submit that it does not and cannot satisfy the congressional policy against the lying railroads, complete freedom to get into the trucking business, because that's what this is in the final analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.289" offset="6364557">We think that the two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.731" offset="6370304">First, we think -- think it because of common logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.047" offset="6383574">And next, we believe the Commission's own decision support this view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.114" offset="6407816">I think the Court will take judicial notice of the fact that the railroads of the country and the aggregate serve just about every point of any commercial importance at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.517" offset="6445432">Now, if merely limiting them, the points on their line complies with the congressional policy here, are then the independent motor carriers of the country are going to find themselves confronted throughout all the railroad system, with railroads operating its railroads on the one hand and an unrestricted truck service on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.656" offset="6534040">Though there'll be a few hamlets here and there, small towns that aren't important enough to want being on any railroad line, where the trucks may not encounter that kind of dual competition, but they would be very small and very few and far between.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.068" offset="6603630">That's the logic of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.660" offset="6610004">Now, the Commission itself long ago has -- in 1946 and it's quite my decision, completely refuted the contention that's made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.713" offset="6650232">Then they referred that to the earlier Barker decision and they said this and I'm quoting, “There also appears to have developed a tendency in rail motor acquisition proceedings to treat the Barker case restrictions as geographical or territorial only in their intent rather than substantive limitations upon the character of the service.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.812" offset="6738631">And there, the Commission emphasized that word, “service” which might be rendered by a railroad or its affiliate under any acquired right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.249" offset="6772381">Now, in our brief here at pages 33 and 34, we've quoted the opening and closing paragraphs of a rather lengthy discussion in the Commission's White Line decision on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.304" offset="6816580">And if I may, I just like to repeat here the most significant portion of the last paragraph which is quoted in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.606" offset="6845837">The Commission said this, “It is clear that any tendency to treat the Barker case as an approval of future rail motor operations which should be unrestricted except territorially, ignores the clear declaration that certain types of operations are disapproved, wherever conducted, and must bring from a misinterpretation of the intent of the reports therein,” referring back to its Barker decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.226" offset="6948237">In its brief here, the Commission makes no mention, whatever, of the White Line case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.818" offset="6966627">In their joint brief, PMT and General Motors however, we think by quoting out of context attempt to leave the impression that the Commission was endorsing the idea that a territorial limitation was all it was needed to conform to Congressional policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.867" offset="7022843">Now that, of course, is really the very antithesis of the Commission's conclusion reached in the White Line case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.206" offset="7052204">The Commission report here says that it reserves the right to impose in the future and I quote, “Any conditions or restrictions which may then appear to be necessary or desirable in the public interest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.365" offset="7104867">You will note even in that reservation, they don't refer to auxiliary and supplemental restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.551" offset="7125556">Now, certainly, this reservation isn't a restriction as of now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.888" offset="7146872">And in addition, if the Commission is correct in saying in its report here that it can impose the usual auxiliary and supplemental restriction because to do so, what convert these operations from contract to common carriage which is not what the applicant wants, then obviously, if they can't do it now, they can't do it anytime in the future either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.726" offset="7234226">So the reservation is a meaningless, we think, phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.266" offset="7252407">So we believe in the final analysis entirely aside from the technical semantical distinctions and what the Commission has done here is to authorize unrestricted operations by this railroad subsidiary without any finding that such operations are justified because of exceptional circumstances and indeed in the teeth of a finding just of contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.730" offset="7338297">In so doing, we think that Commission's decision ignores a clearly discernible guidepost which this Court laid down for it in its ATA decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.305" offset="7376541">I see that my share of the time is moving along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.852" offset="7390751">If I may, I'd like to come next to the issue of standing to sue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.680" offset="7414053">That issue is raised only by PMT and General Motors, a permission has never challenged their standing to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.107" offset="7447803">The basis for the argument seems to be this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.989" offset="7459297">In the proceedings before the Commission, General Motors steadfastly took the position that no matter what happened, even if the application were denied, none of these independent motor carriers who were protesting the application are going to get any of its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.949" offset="7531186">Now, of course, it's either the court below gave a good bit of credence to that and certainly the appellees do, the words of the General Motors' witnesses are really treated almost as the laws of the Medes and the Persians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.364" offset="7584789">And the argument is made that if you're never going to get any business in General Motors issue now, then you can -- and suffered any damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.767" offset="7614464">You haven't suffered any damage, even though you have no standing to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.756" offset="7634422">It's interesting to know that the District Court's majority here which did accept this argument said that if the complaint had been found by qualified party in interest, all of the plaintiffs would've had the right to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.036" offset="7703489">Now, we simply can't imagine who would be qualified parties and interest and entitled to test the validity of this Commission decision if it weren't the protest in carriers before the Commission, if not them, then who?</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.789" offset="7762526">And what the decision really does in this area is to insulate from review any order of the Commission, provided only that the supporting shipper who was before the Commission, of our General Motors here says, “I'm not going to give you any business no matter what happens.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.829" offset="7830653">And the argument would be made subsequently when review were sought that well, you were told you wouldn't get any business and so there's no reason for you to go to court because you haven't been damaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.888" offset="7882898">I supposed General Motors here instead of taking the attitude it did had said that if the application were denied, some of the protestants would be used by it, then I think presumably, these same protestors would've then had the right to go to Court, because that would've been considered to be damaged -- damaged and therefore, given them a standing to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.801" offset="7982582">So that in a real sense, the attitude of this supporting shipper before the Commission here is taken as -- a -- let's put it this way, that the supporting shipper is really given a right by a virtue of its attitude to determine whether or not there'll be any court review of the Commission decision depending on how it goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.109" offset="8083832">The next point I'd like to touch on is the holding of the court below that special circumstance and justified a grant of authority here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.047" offset="8115597">The Court said this at page 81 of the record, “Thus, although the Commission found an absence of unusual conditions which would justify the issue of sub permits for service to points and not on SPs rail line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.611" offset="8173798">There was in the Court's opinion substantial evidence or special circumstances justifying the extension of PMT's contract carrier authority to serve GM.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.973" offset="8215280">We think there are two things wrong with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.014" offset="8227401">First, in effect, it overrules the Commission's finding and no unusual -- no unusual conditions and constitutes a substitution of its judgment for that of the Commission without, in any way, elaborating wherein the Commission was wrong or wherein it's committed any error, that second and we think more importantly, the matters which the Court found to constitute evidence of special circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.125" offset="8327920">The fact that PMT had used the intrastate service in California for many years, the fact that the operations were closely coordinated, the possibility of confusion and disarrangement at General Motors plants of other carriers were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.806" offset="8390614">And finally, the alleged need to meet the competition of Ford and Chrysler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.858" offset="8410781">These matters were all within the control of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.330" offset="8424678">And General Motors knew certainly no one would believe that they don't have a competent counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.636" offset="8449964">New years ago that a motor subsidiary of a railroad was under a specific disability by virtue of the very provisions of the Act and so as we see it, if there is any annoyance by virtue of a denial of authority here as far as General Motors is concerned, that again, we believe, there's no reason to kick a hole in this congressional policy which is we're afraid if it has many more holes, it's going to be more of a seal than a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.468" offset="8593220">We think also that the court below in attaching any significance at all to the amendments in Section 209, of the Act of 1957, we think it was incorrect in attaching any significance to those amendments at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.677" offset="8658108">You'll recall that this Court in the Contract Steel Carriers case in 1956 held that motor carriers were free to aggressively search for new business within the limits of their license and that just didn't jive with the Commission's idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.401" offset="8712965">The Commission's believed that any contract carrier which had as many contracts as the carrier there did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.787" offset="8738565">I had in reality converted its operations to common carriage, so it sought legislations to overcome the effects of this Court's Contract Steel Carriers decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.191" offset="8776182">And in 1957, the Congress enacted just such legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.330" offset="8792691">We therefore dealt with that in a good deal of -- detail on brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.112" offset="8811813">We think the legislative history of that matter shows clearly that all that Congress intended to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.828" offset="8842637">As Commissioner Clark, put it and in testifying in favor of the bill, was simply to restrict the opportunity of contract carriers to solicit customers without restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.323" offset="8884642">We don't believe Congress in any way intended to alter its traditional policy against allowing railroads to get into the truck field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.295" offset="8916511">There's nothing in the whole legislative history that suggests that and I don't need to dwell on the rule against repeal by implication here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.727" offset="8958307">Finally, we think the Commission erred in allowing this authority because of dual operations provisions of the law, which say that unless good cause is shown, the Commissioner shall not allow the performance of both common and contract carriage by the same person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.917" offset="9039078">Now, when this aspect of a case was first considered before these four cases were consolidated in the first Sub 34 report, the Commission pointed out that the specific language of a statute dealt only with transport by motor carriers, but it said we would be remiss in our obligations if we didn't consider the spirit of this legislation and consider the fact that the common carrier here by rail, is a -- that the Southern Pacific serves in a dual capacity as a common carrier by rail and as a contract carrier by motor vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.020" offset="9171466">And it then went on in its -- in its first report to admonish PMT for its failure to really introduce any evidence at all to meet that statutory standard, other than to rely upon the fact, the Commission in its earlier decisions had authorized it to conduct dual operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.184" offset="9236146">But when Sub 37 cases heard over a year after, the Sub 34 case, PMT again is -- there is no evidence at all on the point, even the self-serving declarations of PMT's employee which it has set forth in the appendix to be to its brief and which it claims provides ample evidentiary support for this grant of dual authority, come from the first Sub 34 decision and not from the later and far broader Sub 37 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.673" offset="9358085">Now, again on our brief, we have discussed numerous cases in which -- which involved independent motor carriers in which the Commission held that the mere opportunity to engage in discriminatory practices and I stress that and they are opportunity not as actual exercise is sufficient to warrant disapproval of a grant of dual authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.406" offset="9440946">In here on the situation, we think far more pregnant with opportunity for discriminatory practices, than is a usual case where only motor operations are involved, where the Commission in the first report told PMT that it couldn't rely on its previous grants of dual authority to justify such future operations and where PMT in the Sub 37 proceeding was seeking far broader authority than it sought in the Sub 34 case and it totally ignored the Commission's warning and its obligation to present evidence on this dual authority issue nevertheless, the Commission granted the right (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.647" offset="9589948">And we believe that in doing that, the Commission violated a statutory requirement that there must be a good cause shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.002" offset="9623385">If we have any time left over after Mr. Solomon finishes, I'd like to reserve for rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Solomon</label>
            <text syncTime="2390.926" offset="9667062">May it please -- may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.543" offset="9677511">United States is appearing here in support of the petitioners, because we read the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.849" offset="9702797">It makes a serious in-row in a congressional policy of great importance to preclude railroad domination of the trucking business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.193" offset="9748146">Now, prior to this case under the case law of the Commission and of this Court, the law was that a railroad or a railroad subsidiary could enter the trucking business only in one or two circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.016" offset="9827453">It could do so if its rail operations were to be used to public advantage in connection with its own operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.091" offset="9859741">And this Court held in the American Trucking case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.445" offset="9873115">It can also do so occasionally on the showing of special circumstances which require in the public interest that a rail owned motor carrier provide service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.232" offset="9936332">Now, in this case, as we read the Commission's decision, the ICC has said in a contract carrier situation despite the fact that in this case we find no special circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.120" offset="10007803">Despite that fact, the railroad may nevertheless serve in an extended area -- pardon me, to the railroad subsidiary may nevertheless serve as a motor carrier in an extended area in a manner which isn't conceivably related to the rail's operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.930" offset="10087111">In other words, if this decision stands, as we see it, in a contract carrier situation, a railroad is going to be free at least within the area in which it has rail lines to provide motor service for the largest shippers of this country, such as Southern Pacific is here providing for General Motors, which isn't at all restricted or tied to the railroads operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.268" offset="10208423">And whether or not, we believe that might be good policy, as we understand it, that that is the policy which Congress was intending to preclude in the National Transportation Policy and in Section 5 (2) (b) of this Act, which this Court has properly held has to be considered in this application.</text>

            <text syncTime="2564.370" offset="10360874">I had slightly in saying upon the findings the Commission made, I must perfectly frank in saying that there are underlying facts in this record which are discussed at great length by both of the -- of the appellees here, which if the Commission have thought they were significant, may conceivably have been significant within the meeting of Justice Clark's decision in the American Trucking case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.157" offset="10472051">But as I will try and point out, the Commission found exactly the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.185" offset="10488142">And on this record and with the findings that the Commission made on this record, its alternative was, as we see it, to deny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.590" offset="10529729">I presume there's another alternative to restrict but as a practical matter, restriction is denial, if the restriction is the type of restriction that we always understood the Court and the Commission was talking about, i.e., a restriction with -- does tie rail operations to motor operations to the railroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="2901.508" offset="11709419">The rationale is set forth, Your Honor -- Mr. Justice on page 27 of the Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.532" offset="11741497">This is a very long Commission decision, but very little of it is a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.382" offset="11760933">Most of it is recital of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.892" offset="11770964">What the Commission said on page 27 and I want to point out initially that they weren't discussing on page 27 the 5 (2) (b) problem at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.889" offset="11806908">They were just merely discussing general public interest considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.107" offset="11823835">What they said there was that insofar as PMT wants to serve beyond the rail lines of the Southern Pacific, we don't think they should because that service at the present moment is being shared by rail between the Southern Pacific and other railroads and in one case, another motor carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.812" offset="11910666">And if we allow PMT to serve General Motors beyond the Southern Pacific rail line, it means that some business that Southern Pacific now has as a rail line is going to be diverted to its subsidiary away from other rail lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.631" offset="11989870">And in making this determination since General Motors had argued very strongly that there were special circumstances that required in, in making this determination, the Commission -- and this is in the middle of page 27, says -- talking about the request to serve beyond the rail lines, “Such eventuality has it been in no way justified and the public interest in forestalling it as a parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.879" offset="12102928">And then they say shippers' argument that motor services needed to meet competition of other automobile producers can be accorded little prohibitive way in the face of its continued refusal to make use of the available services of the protesting motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.814" offset="12166666">And they go on in the next sentence to throw out another major argument that General Motors made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.227" offset="12196237">Now, when they came to the service on the Southern Pacific line, at the bottom of the same page, they reached a different conclusion and they reached it for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.432" offset="12249109">The first reason is the protesting motor carriers aren't going to gain anything because after all, Southern Pacific has this traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.424" offset="12289024">It's merely going to go from the rail line to the motor carrier line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.895" offset="12306996">Well, Your Honors, that maybe good economics in the year 1960, but it's very bad law under the Transportation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.957" offset="12347225">Congress has not provided that railroads may freely follow their traffic when for one reason or another the shipper wants to use trucks or aviation or water carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.792" offset="12406575">That is not a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.239" offset="12416293">I shouldn't think it would be a reason under a public interest standard, but it certainly is not a reason why the express policy of this Congress against unrestricted rail operation of motor transport could be negated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.832" offset="12482748">And the other reason they give is the reason to which Mr. Beardsley referred previously and that is they say we might as well grant this service because after all General Motors has said that they're not going to give the business to these protestants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.267" offset="12564459">They're going to give it to another contract carrier in Texas which they happen to like better or if the Commission wouldn't grant that carrier, they'll go in through operations for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.626" offset="12621928">That was the basis upon which they made this determination and the basis was not that they were restricting the service to comply with 5 (2) (b) because, to please the Court, when you look on the very next pages, on page 28 through 31, which is the discussion, the only discussion that this Commission has as to why they were not making the restrictions and not denying the grant because of -- despite the 5 (2) (b) problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="3264.469" offset="13161200">And that's this Court's holding in American Trucking case and if there are special circumstances here of a type.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.358" offset="13192756">Now obviously, this Court in the American Trucking case wasn't saying merely by labeling something special circumstances you get around from the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.287" offset="13232567">Obviously, it was talking at least, Justice Black, in terms of special circumstances which would warrant a deviation from the basic policy of the Act which is that trucking business should be carried on by truckers and not by railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.697" offset="13302157">But the point I'm trying to make is that in this discussion of whether they should impose restriction or not, they end up by saying the restrictions we normally impose and which we imposed in the ATA case -- I mean the Rock Island case, all happened to be applicable to contract carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.916" offset="13391078">Those restrictions would result in making this carrier a common carrier and therefore, we're very sorry but we can't make these restrictions and the only one we can make is the limiting -- restrictions limiting it to a -- the rail lines of the Southern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.684" offset="13462131">A restriction which is I've pointed out and Mr. Beardsley pointed doesn't do the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.457" offset="13489194">They don't consider whether other restrictions might be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.288" offset="13512495">They simply say, “Well, we'll make what restrictions we can irrespective of their effectiveness.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.732" offset="13542275">Now, the trouble with that is that it begs the entire questions in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.008" offset="13563382">The question in this case was not how much this grant has to be restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.265" offset="13592430">The question in this case was whether the grant should be made or not and the difficulty with this entire position of the Commission here is that they assumed that they were going to make the grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.027" offset="13643525">And the only question that they're discussing in this entire three or four-paged discussion in this matter is to what extent it is going to be restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.229" offset="13688247">And they end up by saying they are restricting it, but the -- and of course you can play on words here as to what's a restriction and what is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.506" offset="13725445">But the final thought I do want to leave you with is, whatever you call it, Pacific Motor Transport Company which is a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific is authorized, if this case stands to carry many, many trucks for General Motors from its plants in California to a number of bulk points in a number of States and there isn't any connection between the service which has been authorized here and the railroad, the Southern Pacific parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.054" offset="13871626">There is no connection whatsoever except, of course, that the stockholders of the Southern Pacific will reap such profits as might be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.934" offset="13911124">Now that type of restriction, I suggest, is no restriction as far as the policy applied to (Inaudible) biggest concern.</text>

            <text syncTime="3760.324" offset="15144626">Practically all of this prior contract carrier service has been intrastate to California destinations pursuant to permits issued by the California Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.753" offset="15190392">Substantially, all the transportation from these three assembly plants to points in their distribution areas outside of California has been by rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.702" offset="15230203">That is by a Southern Pacific railroad and its rail connections such as Union Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.526" offset="15257475">The economics of this is that for some years, there's been a steady shift from the rail transportation of new trucks and automobiles to highway transportation by these -- and these specialized trailers which you see in the streets and on the highways all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.579" offset="15325706">Automobile dealers including GM dealers refer the faster service by highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.667" offset="15354023">They prefer smaller dealers like the split deliveries which are more feasible with highway trailer than with railroad car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.493" offset="15389341">The result is that highway transportation of new trucks and automobiles has a competitive factor in a highly competitive industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.114" offset="15427793">Now these assembly plants have a very large physical outfit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.857" offset="15450781">In 1955, for example, the General Motor Chevrolet plant in Oakland produced 125,000 vehicles incidentally at -- at about $2000 a piece, that represents an output with a value of -- of $250,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.781" offset="15530506">And its Raymer plant produced 122,000 cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.265" offset="15548479">The product is valuable and it's fragile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.857" offset="15554748">And we all know from our experience in parking lots.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.314" offset="15572616">The product is bulky.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.124" offset="15579826">It has to be moved promptly not only to meet dealer's competitive needs, but just to get it out of the plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.891" offset="15610964">The Oakland plant, for example, has a storage capacity equal to one-day's productive capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.145" offset="15639907">Each automobile plant, not just GM but any automobile plant, produces a great variety of combinations of color, model, upholstery, special equipment such as power brakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.166" offset="15696018">And each assembly line tries to have these things come off to each dealer's order of 4 or 8 or 12.Come off pretty much simultaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.635" offset="15737919">Something to be loaded, get on the box car or on a trailer and simply moved out of the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.158" offset="15771982">Now at the beginning of the highway transportation of motor vehicles, about 10 or 15 years ago, the initiative from the dealers and the dealers themselves or through carriers from they selected would go to the assembly plants and pick up their cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.225" offset="15840319">And very shortly, it became a chaos of 40, 50 or 100 motor carriers trying to pick up the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.392" offset="15876890">The result was that the automobile manufacturer generally simply took charge of the motor carrier delivery of their product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.451" offset="15909177">They found that the essential coordination of their production lines with transportation could be achieved only, but if they worked with one or perhaps two or three carriers who could completely gear their operations to the assembly line schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.210" offset="15984201">Some of the motor carrier -- some of the motor manufacturers prefer to use common carriers.</text>

            <text syncTime="4440.416" offset="17865017">That we think it's clear as we pointed in our brief that most of PMT's motor carrier service for GM will continue to be intrastate service in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4453.009" offset="17915382">And that is that these interstate operations are distinctly a minor part of the total operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4462.510" offset="17953416">Now, the sole contention in this part of the case is not that General Motors doesn't need motor transportation service or that contract carrier service is not an appropriate form of service, but simply that PMT cannot be allowed to perform it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.270" offset="18020498">Now, we think this Court made it clear in ATA that the specific limitations that provides on Section 5 (2) (b) are not to be applied when the Commission is authorizing new service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.905" offset="18102941">In the Court's words which we think embodied the whole thing, we conclude that the Congress did not intend the rigid requirement of Section 5 (2) (b) to be considered as a limitation on certificates issued under Section 207.</text>
            <text syncTime="4513.949" offset="18159156">We repeat that the underlying policy of Section 5 (2) (b) must not be divorced from the proceedings for new certificates or as in this case, new contract carrier permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.140" offset="18231881">Now, we can admit that the Commission cannot ignore that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4537.957" offset="18255182">We simply say that the Commission has a rather broad discretion in determining how do we effectuate it and what did it do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4547.691" offset="18294157">It was acting solely in response to the specialized massive needs of one shipper, General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4555.751" offset="18326340">General Motors demonstrated their need and none of these facts as to -- as to the shipper's need for service are disputed in this case, never have them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4563.084" offset="18355702">A need for a specialized motor service completely synchronized with its production line schedules wherein an immense value of product.</text>
            <text syncTime="4573.774" offset="18398438">It was already obtaining intrastate service from PMT for the great bulk of the production of its three California plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.320" offset="18432606">Now, I'd like to illustrate about a large portion of this whole operation is intrastate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.204" offset="18468237">Taking one plant alone, the Raymer plant in Los Angeles, the Chevrolet plant, 77% of its 1955 production were delivered to California points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.642" offset="18521945">And of that 77% of its total production, 100% was delivered by PMT in intrastate service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4613.924" offset="18559039">77% of the South Gate plant was thrown entirely in California and PMT delivered 65% of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4622.975" offset="18595297">So to a certain extent and I don't want to exaggerate it, but to a certain extent, the intrastate service in traffic here involved, is the tale, a rather healthy tale to be true of a large intrastate dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.018" offset="18659453">In this combination of intrastate and interstate operation in a single carrier even though controlled by a railroad in order to provide a needed shipper service was one of the major elements of the special circumstances which this Court recognized and sustained in the ATA case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert L. Pierce</label>
            <text syncTime="5711.178" offset="22948133">-- may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5713.095" offset="22955760">As we regard appellant's contentions, they are the -- here, with respect to the restrictions the Commission has granted completely unrestricted authority so far as the usual auxiliary and supplemental restrictions are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5729.899" offset="23022947">This appellant say the Commission could not have done under the language of Section 5 (2) (b), the National Transportation Policy and this Court's decision in the ATA case unless it made the precise specific findings as to the existence of the same special circumstances as existed in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.900" offset="23106957">Now, we think, it is plain from the face of the Commission's decision that appellants major premise that the Commission here granted completely unrestricted authority is patently incorrect as the District Court found and that we think it's also clear that the Commission definitely paid attention to the National Transportation Policy under Section 5 (2) (b) and to the ATA decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5775.403" offset="23204968">I think this is clear from a -- an examination of the Commission's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5779.310" offset="23220642">Let's turn to what the Commission decided on this phase of the case and as discussion of this question at first correctly described this Court's ATA decision as holding that though the policy of Section 5 (2) (b) and the National Transportation Policy must be considered as guiding lights in granting common carrier certificates to railroad subsidiaries nevertheless, they are not rigid limitations and they do not prevent occasional departures from that rule when special circumstances in the public interest exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="5812.438" offset="23353135">It then went on to say that undoubtedly the same principles of the ATA case were to be applied when we had a contract carrier situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.976" offset="23387303">And it went on to say that it had here given due consideration to the National Transportation Policy under Section 5 (2) (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="5828.816" offset="23418650">It next, carefully listed the five restrictions which are specifically described as those and I quote, “Usually imposed in common carrier certificates issued to rail affiliates in order to ensure that the service rendered there under shall be no more than that which is auxiliary to or supplemental of train service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5851.133" offset="23507884">Among those listed as number two was the requirement that applicant shall not serve any point, not a station on the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="5859.338" offset="23540694">The Commission then stated that it believed Congress except an unusual circumstances, did not intend to permit railroad subsidiaries to provide contract carrier service in competition with other railroads and independently operated motor carriers without safeguards to ensure that the service should not be broader in scope in its real operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5880.899" offset="23627003">Accordingly it concluded that in the absence of any showing of unusual conditions, the present permit would be restricted to points on the lines of Southern Pacific.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5891.387" offset="23668903">In other words, the Commission adopted and applied the territorial restriction which he'd -- had set forth as listed as being one of the auxiliary and supplemental restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5901.745" offset="23710386">We think it is evident from the opinion that when the Commission said, there was an absence of unusual conditions, it was referring only to the precise specific special circumstances of the ATA case namely, adequacy of independent motor carrier service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5917.987" offset="23775274">And we think it is also evident that the very reason that the Commission imposed this territorial restriction, this auxiliary and supplemental territory restriction, well, it's because it felt obligated to do so by the ATA decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5931.581" offset="23829713">Now, the only situation in which the Commission did not impose this territorial restriction was in its permitting of service to three small off rail points Austin, Tonopah and Yerington, Nevada, which were points not on Southern Pacific's rail lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="5945.111" offset="23883839">There, however, it appeared that the precise special circumstances of the ATA decision were present since those points were served neither by any railroad, nor by any of the appellant-protesting motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5957.494" offset="23933367">They were not on the line for Southern Pacific either.</text>
            <text syncTime="5960.430" offset="23945070">And the Commission, so far as the restrictions were concerned, also attached a restriction reserving the right to impose in the future any restrictions which may appear then necessary or desirable in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5974.186" offset="24000136">Now, we submit, that the restriction of the rail points is a basic auxiliary and supplemental restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.679" offset="24022079">And I think my answer would be somewhat different from what Mr. Ginnane has said on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5983.671" offset="24038066">We say that this is true whether it's viewed historically or in light of his -- of the policy behind these restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5991.775" offset="24070457">This restriction to territorial points on the rail lines was in fact that one percent adopted by the Commission in the very first volume of the motor carrier reports in the Barker as the basic auxiliary and supplemental restriction to carry out the special limitations on rail acquisitions of motor carriers which were contained on the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, and about 40 cases from that time up until the Kansas City Southern case in 1938, it was constantly -- consistently attached as the only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6023.082" offset="24195741">In the Kansas City Southern case and cases dissents, others of the five restrictions which were listed here have been adding -- have been added including more functional ones such as that service must be performed on rail rates and on rail billings through rail billings with a prior subsequent rail halt, but the Commission ever since despite that, has consistently continued to attach this territorial restriction as one of the auxiliary and supplemental restrictions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert L. Pierce</label>
            <text syncTime="6177.442" offset="24813171">The word territorial would be actually in no connection with the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="6182.701" offset="24834173">We think the present case has to be distinguished from what this Court properly described as completely unrestricted operations in the ATA case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6190.219" offset="24864266">There, the Commission in the prior Rock Island case had first attached all five auxiliary and supplemental restrictions including the territorial one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6198.408" offset="24896972">And in the second Rock Island or ATA case, it has eliminated all five of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6203.015" offset="24915466">Furthermore, as this Court has recognized, Congress must be deemed to have approved the Commission's practice of considering this an auxiliary or supplemental restriction since it reenacted the restricted policy originally contained in the Motor Carrier Act as Section 5 (2) (b) of the Interstate Commerce Act by the Transportation Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="6221.623" offset="24989863">And clearly too, this restriction was auxiliary and supplemental within this period of such restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6228.376" offset="25016926">You know, the purpose behind these restrictions, auxiliary and supplemental restrictions as this Court has recognized, is to prevent rail monopolization of independent motor trucking.</text>
            <text syncTime="6238.975" offset="25059244">Here, the Commission's decision clearly shows that it imposed this restriction solely to carry out this purpose and for the competitive protection of the independent motor truckers as well as the protesting rail lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="6252.371" offset="25112848">It was obviously a restriction which did not reflect the need of the shipper and which probably, as Mr. Ginnane has told, you would not have been attached, if anyone other than a rail subsidiary has been the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6263.978" offset="25159241">Thus, the record establishes that General Motors had just as much need, in fact, if not more to off rail points as they did to the rail points.</text>
            <text syncTime="6273.359" offset="25196857">In fact, also this was a very stringent restriction indeed considering that the application of PMT has sought authority to serve three States which weren't even on the line of Southern Pacific and considering that in the other States the applications had requested authority which was statewide whereas the Commission restricted it to the points on the Southern Pacific rail lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="6295.851" offset="25286823">Now, we think that the Commission's refusal to impose the other usual auxiliary and supplemental restrictions applied in common carrier cases was not based on any departure from the policy of the ATA case instead as the decision clearly shows, it was plainly based on the simple fact and the very different reason that such restrictions would convert these operations of PMT into common carrier operations and would therefore have been beyond the power of the Commission to impose under Section 209 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="6327.433" offset="25413151">Both before and after Section 209 (b) was reenacted by this public law adopted in August 22, 1957, this section had only authorized the Commission to impose in a permit, reasonable terms, conditions and limitations consistent with the character of the holder as a contract carrier.</text>
