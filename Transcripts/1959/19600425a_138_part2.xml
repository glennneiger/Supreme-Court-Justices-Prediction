            <text syncTime="69.049" offset="379591">Yes, but we have found several cases precisely like this one in three circuits -- three other circuits where a judge who an active judge who was assigned to a Court of Appeals en banc and thereafter retired after the case was submitted, participated in the decision of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.395" offset="456913">Now, we found that that practice to be followed in the Third Circuit and we have two cases in our briefs on that in addition to the two cases we have, are (Inaudible) and (Inaudible) against the Auto Racing Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.552" offset="545625">Now, they referred to in the Government's reply brief on page 4 and in our supplemental brief on page 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.162" offset="576031">In both of those cases, Judge Maris, the situation is exactly the same.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur M. Becker</label>
            <text syncTime="159.001" offset="739349">And he was on the court en banc on the rehearing or on the hearing or rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.215" offset="760247">He was a member of the court en banc just like Judge Medina was.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.346" offset="772786">Thereafter, he retired.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.083" offset="779682">Thereafter, the case was decided and he participated in the court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.398" offset="800998">We have also found in addition to that, two -- three cases in the Ninth Circuit which we have called to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.786" offset="838510">Those three cases are Herzog against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.192" offset="856168">In those cases, Judges Bauman and Orr heard the case en banc, thereafter, retired and thereafter, participated in the court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.518" offset="905488">The other case was United States against Price.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.510" offset="917400">In that case, Judge Healey who was a member of the court en banc that heard the case thereafter retired and thereafter, participated in the court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.365" offset="956792">Now, there is another case, In re Sawyer, in which Judge Denman had participated in the case but withdrew, he did withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.436" offset="997125">Judge Hamlin who had been appointed between the time it was submitted and the time it was heard, did not participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.684" offset="1030144">And I think a fair reading of that case is that this was an individual determination of Judge Denman.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.589" offset="1057729">Now, the court pointedly said, the only reason he didn't -- didn't participate was that he didn't want to in every implication particularly since it's bracketed between the two other cases where they did permit the retired judges to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.409" offset="1113004">Every implication is, the court said, “Well, if you don't want to, you don't have to.”</text>
            <text syncTime="257.101" offset="1131813">But the court did not deny him that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.261" offset="1144456">And in addition to that, there are two cases in the Fifth Circuit where the court sat on a rehearing, sat to determine whether a rehearing en banc should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.397" offset="1204955">Now, in those cases the point was specifically raised by dissenting judges like it was here as to whether Judge Sibley, who had sat with the court en bank could participate in the decision en bank denying a petition for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.979" offset="1275277">He did vote, it was denied 3-to-2 with his vote and the other two judges dissented and said, “He had no right to participate and thereto, there were two other judges who had been appointed in the meantime, one to take Judge Sibley's place and one to take Judge Lee's place who had died but had not participated in the original decision because he was ill in the original case.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.499" offset="1377364">And the court did not permit these two new judges to participate in the question of whether a rehearing en banc should be granted but did permit Judge Sibley to participate and it was denied 3-to-2 with his vote being decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.172" offset="1436087">So we have three other circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.245" offset="1444342">I think that case is the same in principle as this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.769" offset="1458448">We have two circuits in which the same question has arisen and be decide this way, a Third Circuit in which a question identical in principle has arisen and to decide it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.433" offset="1501080">And then also in the Third Circuit, you have the case of the judges -- of the active judge from one circuit sitting by assignment and that leads to the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.220" offset="1540263">So, every case, now, it's very difficult to say we have every case Your Honor because they're not -- they're not normally classified.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.532" offset="1569520">We found them by leafing through the books but I had two people doing that for six months and done it myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.099" offset="1595747">My colleagues had done the same thing and the Government has with every case any of us have found all went that way in every single circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="434.814" offset="1842657">And the Third case with the Ninth circuit is United States against Price and that is referred to on page 4 of the Government's reply brief and on page 2 of my supplemental brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="463.279" offset="1956446">They say Judge Maris would have denied that, he never said that.</text>

            <text syncTime="476.438" offset="2009109">Now, therefore I want to particularly stress the two cases that arose in the Third Circuit because there, (Inaudible), appear on page 4 of the Government's reply brief and C-O-R-E-B-I, Corebi against the Auto Racing Company which is also on page 4 the Government's reply brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.780" offset="2114539">Now, and though both of those cases the judge retired after participating in the -- after hearing the case en banc was Judge Maris.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.761" offset="2150379">And he himself thereafter, voted with the court and participated in its decision just like Judge Medina did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.120" offset="2183816">So I do think that our interpretation of his views is correct rather than the Government's interpretation of his use of some general statements he made.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur M. Becker</label>
            <text syncTime="534.072" offset="2239613">No, sir, there was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.691" offset="2246092">The question -- the -- the only case in which I know of in which the action of the judge was ever attacked in participating was in this case and also in the two Fifth Circuit cases where Judge Sibley participated in denying where his vote was decisive, after he retired in denying a petition for rehearing en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.366" offset="2340864">And that was the case where the court sat en banc to deny the petition for a rehearing en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.770" offset="2362493">And in that case the dissenting judges in both of those cases attacked his right to sit on the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.094" offset="2391751">Those are the only cases that I know of or I think the Government has made a similar statement in its brief that they know of in which the -- in which the question was actually discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.837" offset="2454758">Now I'd also like to make one other point.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.866" offset="2466879">I think it is very clear that the Western Pacific Railroad Case, that in Western Pacific Railroad case, this Court held that the majority of the active judges of the circuit could delegate authority to a panel either to deny or to grant a petition for rehearing en banc and that was specifically before them that the panel in that case consisted of two district judges and one circuit judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.550" offset="2593520">As a matter of fact, the majority of the opinion noted that fact and said that's why this -- now, if I might go into the Western Pacific Railroad case a little more because I think it's terribly important to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.458" offset="2641168">What happened there was, the majority of the courts -- the Court Of Appeals said, “We will not pass on a petition for -- for a rehearing en banc.”</text>
            <text syncTime="646.238" offset="2688293">This is a question for the panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.153" offset="2699995">The panel said or -- or this Court interpreted the panel as saying, “We think we're without authority in law to determine whether a petition for rehearing en banc should be granted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="663.031" offset="2755480">Judge Vinson who wrote the majority opinion said, “This panel consisted of one circuit court judge and two district judges.”</text>
            <text syncTime="673.336" offset="2796753">He said that specifically but it was the Court of Appeals, nevertheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.980" offset="2815248">And we -- we hold that the -- that the majority of the active judges could determine to abide by the decision of this panel by entrusting the question of whether a rehearing en banc should be granted to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.512" offset="2885465">And we know that two of the judges are in this panel were district judges and perhaps that's why they thought they had no authority to act so we're sending the case back because we think they could have acted or they said, “The court if it liked, the active judges could themselves have decided the petition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="713.421" offset="2957040">But in any procedure, the majority of the active judges decide this perfectly call of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.840" offset="2982745">They can either delegate their whole authority to this panel with two -- two district judges and one circuit judge or they themselves can adopt the procedure whereby they will decide whether a rehearing en banc should be granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="741.609" offset="3069785">I don't know, Your Honor but I'm -- I'm rather inclined to think it does because the broad rationale of the -- of the Western Pacific Railroad Case was, that it's a grant of power to the Court of Appeals to decide -- devise any acceptable procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.004" offset="3139375">Now, I don't think there's any difference between the active judges who the statute says can determine whether a petition for rehearing en banc should be granted and the active judges who may sit with the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.179" offset="3196113">And I think the one follows with the other and it's a logical -- there's also many other reasons why I believe that's true but there's a logical compactness with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.921" offset="3239058">Certainly, the judges who can vote, grant a rehearing or designate as judges in active service are precisely the same category of judges who can preside on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.313" offset="3276675">Now, I think the Western Pacific Railroad case said, as I interpret it, “The active judges of a circuit are primarily members of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.036" offset="3315545">They must be consulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.496" offset="3325367">They must be members of a court en banc and the legislative history shows us.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.786" offset="3342503">That's why it said all active judges of the circuit shall constitute or a court en banc shall consist of all active judges of the circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.131" offset="3375940">If they wish to call someone else in or they wish to delegate part of their authority, they can do so and I think that avoids the reductio ad absurdum that Mr. Elman spoke up.</text>

            <text syncTime="1611.044" offset="6547519">The active members of the Court are primarily the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.258" offset="6560371">They're defined as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.030" offset="6567476">They have the authority of assigning to the Court and its divisions any judge or justice who is competent to sit as a member of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.824" offset="6602689">And I say that the active judges of the Court have the power if they desire to call in -- to take any judge who's competent under Section 43 (b) and permit him to sit on a court or its divisions or with the -- with the active judges en banc.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.609" offset="6697775">I'd like to point this out, Your Honor that there is -- there is considerable legislative history on this which indicates that was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.364" offset="6732779">Now, as I pointed out before in answer to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question, Section 120 made only the chief justice and the associate justice -- justices of the Supreme Court assigned to each circuit competent to sit as judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.666" offset="6802056">Then the district judges could sit to fill out a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.832" offset="6814699">That -- that obviously was not involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.791" offset="6826506">Now, when 43 (b) was revised, the revisers in their notes -- the revisers in their note provided that the provision of Section 212 of Title 28 U.S.C. for a three-judge Court of Appeals was permissive and did not limit the power of the Court to sit en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.432" offset="6917099">Thus, Subsection (b), and that's the section I'm talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.081" offset="6931728">Thus, Subsection (b) reflects the present status of the law, namely that the Court is composed of not only circuit judges of the circuit in active service or whom there more -- be more than three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.082" offset="6983659">But the circuit justice or justices and judges who maybe assigned or designated to the Court, see Textile Mills Security Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.527" offset="7037471">And all the revisers did when they revised 43 (b) was include the new class of judges who could be designated and assigned to the Court and gave them the same competency, and intended to give them the same competency to sit with the Court en bank that this Court held the circuit justice had under the former Section 120.</text>

            <text syncTime="1844.011" offset="7479463">Ever since the organization of the Court, it has been the practice for the additional justice to participate in the opinions and judgments in cases argued before the Court while he was on the bench although the regular justice whose place he had been appointed to fill had returned to his duties before the judgments ran out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.557" offset="7561592">The right of the additional justice to do so has never been questioned by anyone so far as we know.</text>

            <text syncTime="2727.740" offset="11014353">Your Honor, in picking the date on which the en banc court is constituted, we think that there will result certainty insofar as the judges themselves are concerned and as well as the litigants in the course of the completion of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.036" offset="11091466">Any judge who becomes a member of the en banc court will know that the work that he does on the case and will be accepted or considered that whatever -- whatever his views are, they will be considered by the other judges and that his -- his views will be considered in the final decision whether it be as a part of the dissent or a part of the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.778" offset="11202435">The rule in respect to district judges and in respect to panel judges clearly is that they shall be permitted to continue with the consideration of any case which is given to them to decide irrespective of whether they retire or not and that they can finish the judicial business and we feel that this rule which seems to be of universal acceptance should be accepted from the point of view of the en banc courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.134" offset="11319881">Again, from the point of view of the litigants, as the court below pointed out, if the Court must be reconstituted every time there is a change in the constitution of the group of judges in the circuit, then questions will arise concerning re-argument, resubmission of briefs and it will no doubt delay the completion of the en banc consideration of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2846.287" offset="11488528">I -- I don't think that a judge can feasibly accommodate his retirement to the completion of a case which is uncertain and I think this case is an excellent example of that because the en banc consideration began in December 1957 and wasn't completed until February 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.835" offset="11582673">And there was a 15-month lag there during which -- presumably on the Government's theory, Judge Medina should have postponed his retirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.724" offset="11698239">Now, the retirements on our theory would permit the judge to retire, to participate in the decision, a new judge to be appointed who in turn could take on new duties in the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2986.723" offset="12050265">There is a vacancy, there has not been a substitute appointed for Judge Hincks.</text>
