            <text syncTime="864.325" offset="3560678">Now, getting to this license business for just a minute, as I said earlier, in this -- in this Service Storage and Transfer case, there -- there the storage company was charged with just carrying 3% of its freight in intrastate and they were fined $3500, and this Court held that to have sustained, that fine would be tantamount to a partial cancelation of the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.144" offset="3703933">It seems to me that language is very applicable here and in the Castle versus Hayes Freight Line case, there -- there, the freight line had been overloading in violation of the state law and there was no doubt that the State had the right to pass such a law and they barred -- the State barred the -- the carrier from use of the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.584" offset="3801736">And this Court said, “You couldn't do that because they have a federal license certificate and they have the right to use the highway even though they have violated the state law.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1170.471" offset="4785298">The City of Detroit adopted the smoke ordinance in question about 13 years ago and approximately a little of four years ago, issued the violation that is in question in here and pursuant to the provisions of the ordinance in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.062" offset="4843604">The violation that we issued was a violation that stated that the appellant, in this case, issued smoke in violation in Section 2. 2A, which limits the emission of smoke in -- to a certain density.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.522" offset="4905462">The provision is governed pursuant to a Ringelmann Chart which provides that you cannot issue -- smoke cannot be emitted to any greater density than would be showing at a No. 2 Ringelmann chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.489" offset="4961364">This is a standard form of rate of measuring smoke for the purposes of a Smoke Abatement Code and it's probably in effect in all 48 States and probably on every industrial community in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.111" offset="5019773">Now, after we issued the violation, the plaintiff went into the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.987" offset="5039313">Plaintiff or appellant here, went into the Circuit Court of the County of Wayne and asked for an injunction to restrain us from enforcing the ordinances as to him, claiming that he was engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.730" offset="5086333">That is ship had been approved by Coast Guard pursuant to the federal regulations and that he could be prosecuted, but only for the negligent operation of that equipment, combustion equipment, which is -- the smoke the issue is from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.867" offset="5142862">Now Circuit Court of the County of Wayne determined only one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.412" offset="5156968">They determined that the ordinance was a reasonable regulation and that the city had the right to issue that violation, in question, and prohibit the emission of dense smoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.780" offset="5206497">And this was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.351" offset="5220812">Now, the appellant is before this Court arguing that question of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.675" offset="5238053">I think that the general -- when you consider the general rules of preemption, this Court has determined that when there's an actual conflict shown or there is a repugnancy, or if Congress has manifested the clear intent to regulate the field that you're talking about, then the cities or states do have the right to adopt the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.016" offset="5347453">Now, first of all, when you consider the regulation in question and the federal regulation, I don't think Congress concerned themselves in any way with the emission of smoke and that would be -- I mean, there's no provision within that regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.469" offset="5405236">The original regulation, in answer to a question here, was adopted in 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.833" offset="5426657">In this regulation, from checking the various sections of that code, only goes to the question of the equipment of that ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.184" offset="5464064">They make a thorough inspection of that ship from the hull to the combustion equipment, to the lifeboats and every other boat, only for the purpose to determine that that boat can leave the dock and travel in safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.718" offset="5506278">And for no other purpose, this was the intent of Congress.</text>
