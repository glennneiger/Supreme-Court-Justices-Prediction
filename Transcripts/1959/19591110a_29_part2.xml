          <heading>Argument of Oscar H. Davis</heading>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="9.329">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Davis, you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="9.329" stopTime="585.003">
            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="9.329" offset="140727">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.210" offset="156191">Those who seek to invalidate this statute Section 401 (j) characterize it as punishment and of course, they rest upon the decision of the Court in the Trop case in which that statute the desertion section was characterized as punishment and held to be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.224" offset="248247">We think that this is different at least as presently applied to this particular individual in various respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.688" offset="278131">First, the opinion of the Chief Justice for the four Justices in Trop rested we think primarily on the fact as I mentioned before that the result of expatriation or denationalization in that sense would be statelessness and the discussion is in terms of statelessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.986" offset="351274">That of course would not be the result here because this particular appellee is a national of Mexico and would remain a national of Mexico and as I indicated before lunch that that is not a freak situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.850" offset="402787">That appears to be, I can't speak statistically because we don't know, it appears to be the majority situation or at least a very substantial situation with respect to all the cases which have come up or most of the cases which have come up both judicially and administratively under Section 401 (j).</text>
            <text syncTime="92.434" offset="473109">And as I also mentioned in answer to a query from Justice Frankfurter immediately before the recess, if necessary, we would of course say that the statute can be separably -- separately upheld as to dual nationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.754" offset="526399">We don't of course concede that it would be unconstitutional as to people who are not dual nationals, but we do have that extra argument as to a person like this appellee who is a dual national and as I mentioned before, apparently, a large percentage of people affected by this statute fall in to the same category of dual nationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.529" offset="613439">Then, secondly, with reference to the opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan in the Trop case, we think that there are these distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.301" offset="652622">There's the foreign affairs matter which of course was not present in the -- in the Trop case because desertion could occur in this country and expatriation could occur right in this country as was pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.143" offset="699956">There is not of course also the factor of the total repudiation of all authority of this country by going to someplace where the hand of the country would not reach him.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.133" offset="739871">There is -- of course also not the fact of dual nationality which I just mentioned, but in addition to those factors, there are three other factors that I think I should mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.418" offset="785011">One is, Mr. Justice Brennan, you pointed in your opinion in the Trop case that desertion need not always be serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.055" offset="815626">That there might be desertions from army training camps in this country and you pointed out various situations in which desertion would not be serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.533" offset="845511">I think the same cannot be said here.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.631" offset="853870">I think that fleeing the country to evade the draft is always serious or remaining abroad to evade the draft is always a serious offense against -- against the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.439" offset="893158">A second differentiating factor is that in the Trop case, as the Court will recall there was the power of restoration which was in the hands of the military that is the military could restore citizenship so to speak by reenlisting or re-inducting the man and some of the Justices indicated a disagreement with that power in the hands of the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.000" offset="979362">That of course does not exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.252" offset="988348">There is no such power in the hands of the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.307" offset="1000573">And the third other differentiating factor in addition to the general ones of foreign affairs which I've mentioned is that in the Trop case, the denationalization follow from an -- a criminal conviction and I think Mr. Justice Brennan and perhaps some of the other Justices pointed out that the -- whatever deterrent effect might happen, the expatriation would have would be minimal compared to the criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.118" offset="1115826">Well here, you don't have to have a criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.569" offset="1125648">In fact, the -- the debates reveal and in most cases, Congress thought the people would never return to the country and therefore would never be able to be a proceeded against criminally.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.944" offset="1175176">They did indicate that if they did return, there was to be this additional conditional qualification of denationalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.382" offset="1212897">But I -- making a more broader argument than just the differences between this case and the Trop case, I want to go back if I may to -- to present the argument that this statute, in its inception in 1944 and its place in the 1940 Act was not a penal statute at all in -- in major essence and in major incidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.726" offset="1302235">The Court -- I won't recall for the Court the legislative history, the 1940 Act because it was quite thoroughly canvassed in the -- in the opinions in the earlier cases, but the Cabinet Committee did say that none of the grounds of denationalization which were presented in that Act were punitive in purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.516" offset="1381439">Now, you come to 1944 when this particular Section was added to the -- to the portion of the Nationality Act of 1940 which dealt with loss of nationality to that very portion of the Nationality Act which the Cabinet Committee had said, did not impose any punitive sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.574" offset="1461687">I think perhaps the most important thing which I could say is that Congress of course had the 1865 Civil War Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.447" offset="1493138">It deliberate before it, it deliberately made a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.789" offset="1506513">It did not require any criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.486" offset="1517275">It knew that the 1865 Statute has been interpreted as a penal statute as a punitive statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.306" offset="1540577">It made a change from that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.265" offset="1548413">It did not require any -- any criminal conviction at all and I think the reason was as I've already indicated that they expected that lots of these people would not come back to the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.517" offset="1589478">Now, my -- the opponents will undoubtedly point out that in the debates, there was certain language in which the word penalty or punishment was used and of course, that was true, but I would like to go through the debates and the history to show -- to put these statements in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.819" offset="1674637">If you will look at the reports of the committees, you will not find any reference to punishment or penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.616" offset="1701804">You will find a letter from the Attorney General, Francis Biddle at that time, suggesting this provision and talking in terms of these people not being worthy of citizenship in terms of a qualification or a condition rather than a punishment to be imposed upon certain actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.137" offset="1775888">Then, and I did not find in reading the -- the reports of the committees any reference to punishment or penalty at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.050" offset="1811623">Then, we come to the house debates and this bill was first passed in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.719" offset="1830222">I think that a fair reading of the house debates would also not reveal any real reference to penalties or punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.462" offset="1861256">The major concern of the house was in saying that these people were not worthy of American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.077" offset="1887692">They should not be allowed to return to this country after they had failed to fulfill their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.305" offset="1916635">There was a reference by Congressman Dickstein that he considered these people to be traitors, but I think that was a general colloquial reference rather than a designation of this as a crime or punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.027" offset="1963447">Now, you -- I think the real main burden of the -- of the history in the house was in terms of qualification, in terms rather not of punishment, but of qualifications for citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.544" offset="2029589">Then you come to the Senate and it was a very short debate in the Senate and Senator Russell did use the term punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.955" offset="2055189">These people are worthy of punishment or a penalty, he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.728" offset="2074311">I -- I would stress the fact that this was a bill which was unanimously reported and unanimously accepted and then on the basis of a very short debate in -- in the Senate in which the one person who spoke, though he was a Chairman of the committee, he was, a colloquial usage of the term punishment or penalty should not be used to invalidate a statute of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.568" offset="2173680">That when you seek to invalidate a statute of Congress on the ground of unconstitutionality of its invalidly imposing punishment, I think you have to have something more than some words spoken on the floor of the Senate obviously unprepared and extemporaneously in which a word was used which in other context might invalidate the Statute, that is if it were truly punishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.877" offset="2282872">I have already -- I don't want conceive that if it were punishment it would be invalid because my alternative argument of course would be, that even if it were punishment, the consequence which arose in the Trop case of statelessness would not occur here and therefore you would not have the holding of cruel and unusual punishment that you had in that case, but that's my -- I might call secondary argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.211" offset="2376182">The broader argument I would make is that the statute does not impose punishment at all and therefore is not to be governed by the provisions of the Eighth Amendment or the other criminal provisions of the Constitution.</text>

          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="585.003" stopTime="586.842">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="585.003" offset="2443368">Mr. Davis.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_r_davis" startTime="586.842" stopTime="1154.036">
            <label>Mr. Thomas R. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="586.842" offset="2450787">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.242" offset="2468342">At the risk of being a little tedious, it may be useful for us to turn back to the exact terms of the remand since this Court – case is here for the second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.343" offset="2528737">It was sent back to Judge Jertberg, the sole judge in the northern division of our Southern District in California to reconsider in the light of Trop versus Dulles.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.744" offset="2574399">Now, it has been said more than once here this morning and this afternoon and I'm sure the Court is by this time aware that in Trop versus Dulles, the statute that was held unconstitutional was Section 401 (g) of the national -- Nationality Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.197" offset="2640123">Section 401 (g) provided that in time of war, a deserter who did desert could lose his citizenship for that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.455" offset="2701145">Now, the Court is asked to consider Section 401 (j) which provides that a citizen deserter, a potential soldier who deserts before he's even gotten to the -- to the military service who leaves the United States or remains outside the United States may also lose his citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.436" offset="2789125">And I -- I submit, I hope I do not exhibit temerity by suggesting that if Congress had simply provided for the loss of citizenship in the case of draft evasion, we wouldn't be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.951" offset="2855163">The key element, the element that causes this to be an issue before this Court is departing or leaving the United States for the purpose of draft evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.686" offset="2906154">Now, if this is the case, I suggest to the Court that all of the facets that we have considered and Mr. Davis has eloquently spoken on it can be considered in the light of that single element is departing from or leaving the United States a distinction with or without a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.895" offset="2994970">Is it a distinction that should cause this Court to reverse the result in (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="731.170" offset="3028093">The first part considered by the Government in its discussion and I think properly is the Foreign Affairs power.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.146" offset="3071979">In considering whether or not this element of departing and remaining outside the United States introduces into this statute a new element which should persuade this Court to hold the statute constitution -- constitutional after having held Section 401 (g) unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.749" offset="3162363">In considering that, I suggest that we first again perhaps at the risk of being a little tedious can look directly at the language of the statue itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.274" offset="3204472">Departing from or remaining outside of the jurisdiction of the United States is the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.105" offset="3239790">I submit Your Honors, if Congress had truly had in mind the Foreign Affairs power, it never would have employ -- employed such awkward and negative language.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.276" offset="3300498">I do not mean to be facetious but it is possible to violate 401 (j) simply by crossing the international boundary in Lake Michigan to avoid a pursuing federal authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.165" offset="3348041">It's possible to violate it by going to some totally uninhabited land.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.230" offset="3372283">If Congress had truly had in mind the Foreign Affairs power when it considered and passed Section 401 (j), I submit that it reasonably could have been expected to use some language like entering in to or remaining in a foreign state or a language which would have that same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.020" offset="3483460">In both the Mackenzie and Perez cases, there was that -- an element which does not exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.757" offset="3542392">The purpose in those two cases was to separate citizens from non-citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.259" offset="3572381">No counsel appearing before this or any other Court to my knowledge has suggested any other way in which one could -- the Government reasonably could be expected to have separated -- I'm sorry, to have effectuated the power of the Government to tell who was the citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.981" offset="3651271">It has to establish standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.539" offset="3665481">Therefore in Perez and Mackenzie, there is a unique element.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.186" offset="3684080">Congress chose the sole available remedy to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.820" offset="3706650">In contrast, if we are considering the Foreign Affairs power here, I submit that no such situation obtains with respect to draft evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.149" offset="3755969">If the wrongdoer who was in fact a subject to punishment, I submit to the Court that there was available the usual scheme of conventional penal remedies that there is nothing unique in the -- in the fact of expatriation which was particularly necessary to effectuate this congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.349" offset="3884805">Therefore, for the first time, Congress has departed from a principle which I submit it has hitherto adhered to and that is let us not take away citizenship unless it is the sole means of accomplishing our purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.970" offset="3951261">Now, whether it is penal in this in the technical sense, I will consider with your permission in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.970" offset="3999222">The next question with respect to the Foreign Affairs power is one which was raised by two members of the Court in interrogation on oral argument by the Government and that is how does this coercion actually facilitate the conduct of Foreign Affairs as a practical matter, what does it achieve?</text>
            <text syncTime="997.236" offset="4092322">If the United States is having trouble with Mexico, does it really make things any easier for Mexico to take away the citizenship of the people who had used Mexico as a refuge from the Draft Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.962" offset="4151254">I submit on the contrary, if the Court please, that it has created a problem of some proportions for Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.379" offset="4180929">What is the status of these people who are here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.103" offset="4191796">They may or not be citizens of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.203" offset="4204231">As I suggested in my brief, they may be named Jones and they may come from Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.693" offset="4226173">Now, what have we done to Mexico to create these stateless wanderers within its boundaries?</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.744" offset="4246340">How have we facilitated the relationship of our Government with theirs?</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.159" offset="4283956">And in that same connection, I suggest that there is nothing in the history of the United States in concrete terms that has been suggested to this Court, which even remotely implies that there is any real problem in foreign relations created or potentially available because of the existence draft evaders in a foreign land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.862" offset="4390849">What really is the problem?</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.734" offset="4402343">Now, counsel in his brief has -- has very ably discussed the early problems of the United States with respect to the impressments of foreign sailors which brought about in part the war of 1812.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.456" offset="4465246">What is that something that we are really faced with today as a practical matter?</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.435" offset="4489070">I think implicitly and I'm putting words in counsel's mouth, but I think implicitly, he admits that the problem doesn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.970" offset="4527208">That in Judge Jertberg words, they are no different than ordinary tourist as far as their practical impact on the Government of Mexico is concerned, but seeing that gap in their argument, the Government hastens to say, but the United States may run in to trouble when it seeks to get these people back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.463" offset="4625220">Now, I have suggested in my brief and I will merely suggest in passing here the fact suggests that the United States is in a position of having to -- to act without volition that it's forced in to a position where it must create problems with the Government of Mexico or whatever Government may be involved, but I suggest --</text>

            <text syncTime="2350.603" offset="9505834">Other members of the Court have evidenced a feeling that the scope of Congress is not so large that there must be a really reasonable connection, a really reasonable expectation, if Your Honor please, of results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.004" offset="9571349">Otherwise, within that very scope of the necessary and proper clause and nowhere else, this Court has the right to hold that the Statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.089" offset="9635715">Now, I have omitted the contention and I should not omit it that this statute is penal in its character because of its traditional alliance with the ancient punishments of banishment and of ostracism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.886" offset="9710947">And as a final point in that connection, I submit that it -- it leaves (Inaudible) the contention of -- this is a regulatory power when we consider the true most of recorded history, banishment and ostracism and in the end this comes to nothing but that with the harshest among the harshest and least humane of punishments that were used by early man and the abandonment of those punishments has been considered to be an act of enlightenment or triumph of civilization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.129" offset="9871862">Now, if the Court should adapt my contention that we are in fact dealing with a penal statute, then we come squarely face to face with the express position expressed by the Chief Justice for three other members of the Court in Trop that Section 401 (j) was dictum in a sense was lacking even the rudiments of procedural due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.814" offset="10002578">Yet, before anybody did anything, the citizenship was drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.755" offset="10026402">There was -- there's no -- even a provision -- as the Chief Justice pointed out under 401 (g) at least there was a court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.690" offset="10054092">Somebody considered whether or not the man had done the act in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.673" offset="10074049">In the present case, there's just a naked statement that one who leaves the United States or remains there for the purpose of draft evasion, ipso facto loses his citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.295" offset="10128593">The first answer given by the Government to that is of course to rely on Section 503, which gives a right to declaratory relief and was in fact the Section under which this present action was brought, but as previous questions I believe by Mr. Justice Stewart have already brought out, there is no provision here for trial by jury or the other careful protections that are given in the case of a truly penal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.684" offset="10262131">And on this particular point, I invite the Court's careful attention to a letter which counsel himself cited in his argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2750.834" offset="11106722">I could not make the argument of his ability to call upon the state of his own nationality for protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.079" offset="11135666">But there would be an argument, not as strong but I think that would exist and could exist in the situation whereby Mexico, if it were in difficulties with the United States could say to Cuba, we don't want you to send Mendoza back to the United States; he is our national, he's a Mexican and we want you to keep him there in Cuba we don't want him to go back to the United States to fight in this war which we don't agree with.</text>

            <text syncTime="2852.615" offset="11513814">On the issue of due process, I think counsel was in error in talking about the burden of proof under Section 503 of the Nationality Act -- under declaratory judgment proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.551" offset="11573582">As I well know from a case that I had argued previously in this Court, the burden is on the plaintiff, the Mendoza in this case to show that he was born in America which he does by showing his proof, I mean, showing his birth in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.070" offset="11631679">The burden then shifts to the United States to prove that he was expatriated so he does not bear the burden of proving, under this Court's decision, that he is not expatriated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.985" offset="11671280">He bears the very simple burden of showing that he was born I believe in California in 1922.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.230" offset="11692283">The burden then shifts to the United States to show that he went to Mexico for the purpose of evading the draft or remain there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.213" offset="11716211">Of course those issues are not involved in this case in view of the undisputed stipulated facts, but the -- the general counsel I think misapprehends the request of the proceedings under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.739" offset="11774307">Counsel said to the Court that Congress could not have been interested in foreign affairs problems because of the wording that it shows for the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.014" offset="11815476">He thought that Congress should have said, departing from or remaining outside of the jurisdiction of the United States in time of war or during a period declared by the Presidency to be national emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.336" offset="11856750">Instead of saying that, they should have said, departing from or outside the United States to enter a foreign country, I suggest that if that language had been used and a man had gone on a ship of a foreign nationality, the Government would have a much harder job than we have here today, but the general language departing from a remaining outside the jurisdiction covers practically every though of it because it covers anybody who goes to the land territory of the foreign country and it covers people who go on ships or airplanes of foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.133" offset="11983914">The only place that I think would not be covered might be some wasteland in Antarctica and I suppose most of those are now claimed by the countries of the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.816" offset="12018604">So that the land which is very apt to cover everybody who goes, who put themselves under the jurisdiction of another country either on a ship of another country or on a -- on land territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.874" offset="12070849">To mention, I have talked a bit on this rebuttal of dual nationality which was also brought out, aspect to which it would brought out in colloquy of Mr. Davis and the members of the Court, but I would like to say several -- few more things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.343" offset="12152769">Every country in the world allows a person to renounce his nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.160" offset="12175966">Mendoza could have renounced his Mexican nationality; he wasn't compelled to retain his Mexican nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.894" offset="12207000">So that I think that really, there's no substance to the argument that it was imposed upon him willy-nilly and that he had to have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.988" offset="12239287">He could have renounced his Mexican nationality but instead of renouncing his Mexican nationality, he sought to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.290" offset="12268544">He went to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.816" offset="12274604">And the reason why dual nationality is so important and not just an accident or freak in these cases is that it's because people with dual nationality have a better chance of going to other countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.204" offset="12328208">If a man named Smith from Vermont, who is not a national of Mexico, arrives at the Mexican border, he won't get in ordinarily. Mr. Mendoza-Martinez gets in because he claims Mexican nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.796" offset="12378572">So, it's inherent in the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.280" offset="12384528">It's not freak or an accident that people of dual nationality have a greater chance of going to other countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.306" offset="12408560">I don't need to say that they're the only ones because they aren't, but they do have a greater chance and this was an actual effect that a major part of the problem of which Congress was dealing and the appellee here did choose to take advantage of his Mexican nationality and go to Mexico.</text>
