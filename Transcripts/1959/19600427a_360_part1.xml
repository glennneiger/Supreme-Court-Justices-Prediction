            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 360, United Steelworkers of America, Petitioner, versus American Manufacturing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.041" offset="147519">Mr. Feller, you may proceed with your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_e_feller" startTime="14.919" stopTime="541.801">
            <label>Mr. David E. Feller</label>
            <text syncTime="14.919" offset="163088">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.252" offset="176358">This case, number 360, the American Manufacturing case is the first of three cases which the Court has set down for a consecutive argument which deal generally with the questions of the role of the courts in enforcing arbitration and enforcing arbitration awards in suits arising under Section 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act in consequence to this Court's decision in the Lincoln Mills case, 353 U.S. just a little more than two years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.013" offset="319404">Two other cases, the first two, number 360 and number 443, involved a refusal by a company to arbitrate grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.363" offset="380844">The third case involves the case where there was a refusal to arbitrate, the Court ordered arbitration, the employer refused to comply with the award and the question arises at the tail end of the process as the case comes here in terms of -- of the authority of the Court in enforcing -- the role of the Court in enforcing the arbitration award.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.453" offset="473213">Now, before we get into the three cases, I think one thing should be said about all three.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.374" offset="504874">All three represent normal collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.519" offset="521488">There are differences in the arbitration provisions and we'll advert to them as we come to them but there's nothing peculiar about the contracts involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.024" offset="571434">But the cases are peculiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.327" offset="580629">They are atypical in the sense that the question is here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.804" offset="614588">Grievances like the grievances involved in these three cases are being arbitrated by the hundred and thousands everyday under arbitration clause, is no different to these.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.812" offset="670595">It is a rare case.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.446" offset="677177">I think Harry Shulman once said it that -- and I think perhaps it was reflected in the opinions -- has been reflected in the opinions of this Court that it is the atypical case that gets into litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.012" offset="723466">Now, the reason I stressed that point that in dealing with cases which are atypical because of the employer's refusal to arbitrate the kinds of grievances which most employers arbitrate under similar contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.425" offset="801102">The Court, in dealing with this fringe kind of employers if I may so, will necessarily have an effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.677" offset="834121">The decision will necessarily have an effect on the arbitration process as it is practiced throughout the country in industrial relations generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.641" offset="873932">I think every informed student of the subject has expressed concern about some of these very cases because of the effect which they will have, unnecessarily have in the arbitration process which is so far undisturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.050" offset="947597">And so with that preliminary statement, let me turn to a statement of the facts in the American Manufacturing case.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.916" offset="983019">Facts in this case are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.241" offset="1004335">Contract was executed in December 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.480" offset="1029308">It contained an arbitration provision which is perhaps we have referred to it as the same as the standard arbitration provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.796" offset="1070582">It's set out in full in the record, several places in -- for convenience on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.705" offset="1106213">We have a combined brief in those three cases on page 43.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.466" offset="1129200">The arbitration provision in this agreement provides that, “Any disputes, misunderstandings, differences or grievances arising between the parties as to the meaning, interpretation and application of the provisions to this agreement, which are not adjusted as herein provided, may be submitted to the Board of Arbitration for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.927" offset="1215091">The arbitrator may interpret the agreement and apply it to a particular case but shall have no authority to add to, subtract from, or modify the terms of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.753" offset="1250408">The final clause of the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="291.357" offset="1268799">In the footnote at that page, we have indicated that this is in substance, the arbitration provision which has become the standard American arbitration provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.683" offset="1306102">Variations in language occur but essentially, it limits the arbitration to questions of interpretation and application and provides that the decision shall be final and binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.506" offset="1365347">Now, during the course of this agreement, of course it contains other provisions on the arbitration clause, it contains a seniority clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.855" offset="1402755">During the term of this agreement, the grievant, a man named Sparks, suffered an injury to his back on March 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.273" offset="1448417">He -- within a few weeks after he suffered the injury, he filed a very simple petition asking for workmen's compensation under the Tennessee law filed in the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.392" offset="1500975">In September 1957 while he was still off from work, the workmen's compensation proceeding was settled on a compromised basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.887" offset="1546951">The settlement recited that there was a dispute as to whether there had been an injury in the course of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.312" offset="1572655">But there was a dispute as to whether Sparks was temporarily disabled and the extent of his temporary disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.021" offset="1603480">There was also a dispute as to whether he was permanently disabled and the extent of his permanent disability and that the settlement as a compromise of these various disputes would seem to be a fair compromise and the matter what's settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.798" offset="1666591">Thereupon, Sparks applied for reinstatement to his job and submitted to the employer a statement that he was able to return to his job without danger to himself or to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.925" offset="1747048">Well, this is not an unusual case, there are many people who have partial disabilities who are working.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.931" offset="1767111">And the fact that a man gets a partial disability payment doesn't necessarily preclude him from working.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.865" offset="1790830">And of course, people do recover from disabilities even if a doctor is of the opinion that the disability will be permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.463" offset="1825207">The company refused to reinstate him.Grievance was filed by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.078" offset="1843702">Grievance was not settled, the union asked that the grievance be submitted to arbitration claiming that under the seniority provisions of the agreement, Sparks was entitled to return to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.639" offset="1905977">The company -- this -- this contract as a tripartite Board of Arbitration, sometimes don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.103" offset="1939832">The union appoints one member.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.673" offset="1946102">The company appoints one member.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.003" offset="1951431">The two appoint a third man who is really the man who decides the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.529" offset="1981524">Usually, when you do provide -- so provide, actually, the parties name the third member and the two act just as consultants on either side.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.957" offset="2015169">In any case, the union named its member of the Board of Arbitration and he got in touch with the company, the company named its member of Board of Arbitration, then the company suggested that the union submit a name of prospective arbitrators, the union did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.342" offset="2068773">And then the company said, ”Well, hold off holding -- naming this arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.695" offset="2090193">We want to examine this Mr. Sparks again.”</text>
            <text syncTime="501.727" offset="2110255">And it was held off.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.815" offset="2118614">They examined Mr. Sparks again.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.003" offset="2127391">The company doctor submitted a report saying that he thought that Sparks was -- still remained disabled and should not be put on a job which required heavy lifting.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.993" offset="2175352">That was the extent of his finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.364" offset="2184861">Thereupon, the company said, ”We refuse to arbitrate on the ground that this matter has been adjudicated in a Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="527.746" offset="2214327">Of course, actually, the Court never adjudicated anything as it was settled.And second of all, even if it had adjudicated anything, it didn't adjudicate the question of whether he was able to return to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.934" offset="2255078">Most of adjudicated that he had 25% disability which should in fact --</text>

            <label>Mr. David E. Feller</label>
            <text syncTime="553.620" offset="2317876">Well, it's not in Tennessee, it's not in the court, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.501" offset="2333341">And the compromise settlement must be approved by the -- I think there's the -- the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.752" offset="2362389">And the approval is listed on page 31 of the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.538" offset="2381511">There is a decree, settlement approval which is required under the workmen's compensation statute which recites that the Court being of the opinion of the said settlement and compromises proper and in accord with the Court with the workmen's compensation law, it is ordered that it be approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.022" offset="2471476">Well, the union brought suit to compel arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.329" offset="2504704">The parties cross moved for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.067" offset="2515675">The matter was heard on the pleadings in affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.007" offset="2535424">There was no dispute about any of the facts which I have so far stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.958" offset="2559248">The company -- the District Court gave judgment for the defendant refusing arbitration on the ground that Sparks having asserted and submitted a doctor's certificate saying that in the doctor's opinion, he would remain 25% percent disabled was estopped from asserting his -- any right to reinstatement under the collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.738" offset="2666350">The union appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.465" offset="2685262">The Sixth Circuit said, “First, the question of estoppel, if there is one, is one for the arbitrator.”</text>
            <text syncTime="652.045" offset="2711594">This maybe a good defense against this claim for reinstatement under the contract but that's a question of the arbitrator, not for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.980" offset="2743254">Also disposed of a -- on a different claim which the company had made that the matter had been adjudicated in the Circuit Court of Hamilton County, Tennessee by saying, “Nothing had been adjudicated in the Circuit Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="673.106" offset="2795813">And then said, ”Well, it is clear that there is a seniority provision in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.521" offset="2813471">There are limitations on the company's right to discharge employees and there would appear to be a question of the interpretation and application of this agreement which would be arbitrable except as may here and after appear.”</text>
            <text syncTime="692.000" offset="2871359">That's almost an exact quote from what the Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.157" offset="2887973">And then it went in to the here and after.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.315" offset="2900616">They said, “Now, looking at this contract has the seniority clause which says that in cases of promotion and transfer and reemployment, seniority shall be a factor if ability and efficiency are equal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="717.672" offset="2974072">Now, we cannot see how anybody can sensibly claim that Sparks' ability and efficiency are equal to those of other employees if he has a 25% percent disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.356" offset="3036766">Now, his doctor's certificate that he's able to return to work, we think is not evidence of sufficient probative value to even raise a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.627" offset="3069889">We think this isn't just frivolous, it's baseless.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.407" offset="3080965">And we hold that if a grievance is so frivolous and baseless, that it couldn't possibly be granted except to imply there, I suppose by an idiot or a fool, it can't go to an arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.378" offset="3124851">The implication I suppose being, the arbitrator might be an idiot or a fool.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.224" offset="3148257">And so the Court held that the grievance was not arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.286" offset="3164557">Now, I don't want to get into at length, the Court's reasoning on the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.291" offset="3188485">But actually, on any analysis, the Court of Appeals made some rather difficult -- there's also very difficult questions of contract construction and interpretation in order to reach the conclusion that the question was so frivolous that it couldn't go to arbitration because this contract is not at all clear as most contracts are not in many respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.579" offset="3293706">The seniority provision dealing with promotions, transfers and reemployment was assumed by the Court to deal with the question of a man's right to come back to work when he's been off sick.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.327" offset="3344697">There are specific clauses dealing with sickness and disability of the contract but it's not at all clear that a man who was off sick has to meet the requirement that his ability and efficiency be equal to other employees if ask to come back to work after his sickness.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.652" offset="3417945">He might have been unequal on the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.379" offset="3436857">A very good argument and I think the more logical interpretation of this agreement is that if a man is off sick, there are particular provisions saying he has to give notice that he is going to be off sick to preserve his seniority status.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.947" offset="3495163">That if he's off sick, he's entitled to come back to work unless as a result of the sickness, he is dischargeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.328" offset="3536645">And the Contract Clause does provide for discharges where a man's work is of such quality that he would justify discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.309" offset="3584606">And so this question really wasn't a seniority grievance but it was a discharge grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.093" offset="3607698">I don't think this Court isn't the arbitrator no more than I think the Sixth Circuit was the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.220" offset="3628283">And I don't think that this Court has to get into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.707" offset="3642180">But it can very well be argued that if I'm off sick and I get a cold and I'm off work for five days and the same rule has to apply in the disability case, I don't have to come back to my job and prove that I'm better or equal in ability as the man who took my job on a temporary basis while I was away.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.277" offset="3720443">Most arbitrators would say, “You're entitled to come back to your job unless there is ground for discharging.”</text>
            <text syncTime="910.006" offset="3743431">And the question on promotion as to what this clause was written for where two or three people bid for a job, the employer only agrees that if their ability and efficiency are equal then the senior man will get the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.621" offset="3797870">You're making a comparison between three people.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.031" offset="3807483">But when you say, “I'm coming back to work.”</text>
            <text syncTime="928.831" offset="3818663">Whose ability and efficiency do you have to equal?</text>
            <text syncTime="931.416" offset="3829008">The guy who took your job?</text>
            <text syncTime="932.788" offset="3834546">Well, maybe his ability and efficiency are better but then what about some other job which the seniority might be entitled to you in the department.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.256" offset="3860355">He measures your efficiency against the -- the least able and the least efficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.297" offset="3880521">What if there are just plain other people who have 10%, 15%, 25% disabilities?</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.203" offset="7044159">In the absence of arbitration, the Court would decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.009" offset="7055444">So perhaps our ideas of giving respect to the party's wishes are offended if we say despite the agreement to arbitrate, we'll let the Court look into it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1813.249" offset="7356374">Well, I am arguing and this argument will become critical in the next case, is that when they agree to arbitrate all questions of interpretation and applications and they also agree on an absolute no-strike clause barring the relief which the union would have otherwise in the absence of the no-strike arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.365" offset="7460864">That in that case, the Court should construe the questions of interpretational application which the parties commit to the arbitrator precisely as they say it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.916" offset="7503078">As a matter of fact, if there are any doubts, you should give the broadest possible scope to the arbitration provision because the consequence of the Court saying that the dispute is not arbitrated, is not as it is in the commercial contract that is litigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.904" offset="7562951">The consequence is that you are saying that this controversy is one which the employer wins because the union has given up the right to strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="1901.683" offset="7710072">Suppose a man reports under those circumstances, he is given to four hours pay and files a grievance saying, “Well, I think, that really means I'm entitled to six and they'll making as absurd the grievance as I can, frivolous if you want to, baseless.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.596" offset="7773706">The union says, “We want to arbitrate that grievance,” and the Court says, “Well, this is preposterous, four means four not six.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.802" offset="7818533">The Cutler-Hammer doctrine, say in those cases, you don't arbitrate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.833" offset="7846745">But what would happen given the same clause, the same kind of question, the employer paid them two hours pay and said four means two.</text>

            <text syncTime="1950.184" offset="7904110">Well obviously, you can file a grievance but the question isn't arbitrable?</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.556" offset="7917589">This is what grievance -- it clearly ought to be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.782" offset="7934516">Now, there are a lot of union people who will say, “We don't arbitrate that kind of grievance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1966.157" offset="7967953">I have always advised them that you have a grievance in arbitration provision and that says every question of interpretation and application if it's in good faith and not just a way of avoiding these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.614" offset="8005778">If it's in good faith, no matter how clear it maybe to you, if the grievance is a good grievance, goes to the grievance of arbitration procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1987.810" offset="8054575">Only doubtful questions to go to arbitration, all the questions which are not doubtful can be resolved apart from the arbitration procedure, i.e. if the grievance is clearly bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.325" offset="8092714">You don't arbitrate it if the grievance is clearly good, the union can strike and you can resolve that question when this employer sues the union for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.812" offset="8134614">And actually there have been such cases, not in the Cutler-Hammer context where the courts never seemed to follow Cutler-Hammer there but there have been cases were employers have sued unions for breach of a contract agreement not to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.052" offset="8191561">The union's defense has been “We are striking about something that wasn't arbitrable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.589" offset="8221759">Because not all those strike arbitration provisions are all inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.041" offset="8243493">Parties can agree, such a question is not arbitrable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2373.357" offset="9596844">This in a way might be said to the -- in the particular case than the general case that my adversary, as on to playfulness present here because this comes under the statute, labor management relations generally known as Section 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.038" offset="9715545">And yet pursuant to that statute which provides that suits for violation of contracts between an employer and the labor organization maybe brought in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.814" offset="9774582">A suit was brought alleging and this I emphasize because in the decision as it was filed in the Court of Appeals, Judge Miller in his concluding paragraph there made it quite positive in his statement that this is an alleged grievance rather than a real grievance, that this is so clearly a baseless one that, although he arrived and that court unanimously arrived at a different course but arrived at the same result has tried in this -- in the District Court -- arrived at the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.657" offset="9929958">That this was not a case where the complainant, the plaintiff, the union had shown that there were issues to be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.514" offset="9969455">Now, why is it a case that is a particular one?</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.135" offset="9991920">The union in this case, the original plaintiff in the District Court moved for summary judgment and we submit, may it please this Court that the Rules of Civil Procedure that are applicable to summary judgment procedures are no different in a case involving the Labor Management Relations Act or a labor management contract or agreement then it would be in any other matter before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.605" offset="10141759">Now, the petitioner in asking for summary judgment did so fully aware of the rules and the requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.089" offset="10195780">The petitioner, the union, chose not to bring into that case any proof, any affidavit or anything showing in the pleadings or any statement from this man, Sparks on whose behalf this suit was filed that he was entitled to this relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.566" offset="10281671">Now, I say that -- may it please the Court, in this -- for this reason that it is necessary, I believe, for us to go a little bit into the facts of the case as it was before that Court and of course as it was been before the Court of Appeals to show that there was not a real grievance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.381" offset="10364844">There was no issue for the Court to decide in the position that the union took both there and in Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.407" offset="10400998">Now, if the federal court -- if Congress in under 301 had any purpose other than that the Court should initially determine whether there was some issue to submit, why was this Section 301 at the Labor Management Relation Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.213" offset="10492217">Why was it there?</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.346" offset="10496711">Why couldn't the Congress simply have said, “Every matter, no matter how foolish, no matter how clearly baseless, no matter what the plaintiff comes in and does not show, once it's a labor management discussion, once it's in -- an alleged grievance, the Court can only go on and say where the arbitrators will have test on it.”</text>
