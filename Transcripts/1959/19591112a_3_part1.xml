            <label>Mr. Harvey Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="21.044" offset="187538">Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.798" offset="202585">In this matter, arising out of the maritime tort was brought for damages for wrongful death and for personal injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.028" offset="243440">The case was originally started on the civil side of the United States District Court in West Virginia, but was transferred on motion to the admiralty side over objection of the respondent, I might add, and it was tried before the judge as an admiralty suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.127" offset="319927">The case involves Marvin Goett, who was a maritime worker employed by the respondent, Amherst Barge Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.077" offset="359633">That Company had a marine repair yard just outside of Charleston, West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.640" offset="385964">The vessel that was involved in this case was an unpowered and unmanned tank barge, which was owned by the respondent, Union Carbide and which was turned over to Amherst Barge for painting, sandblasting and for minor repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.348" offset="468720">The words, “minor repairs” are actually set forth in the contract between Union Carbide and Amherst Barge and in addition to that, in answers to interrogatories presented by Union Carbide, they conceded that the repairs were indeed minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.399" offset="573001">The lawsuit was predicated upon Carbide's negligence and Carbide's failure to provide a seaworthy vessel to Mr. Goett.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.675" offset="614066">There was at no time any violation of coast guard regulations or statutes involved in the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.598" offset="661713">The barge itself was turned over by Carbide to Amherst on October 2nd of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.053" offset="695568">On October 4th or October 3rd, one of Carbide's men came aboard the vessel to inspect the vessel and to discuss the work which had to be done and at that time, knew or must have known of the conditions which existed aboard the vessel and those conditions were as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.643" offset="769964">There was complete absence of any safety or lifesaving equipment aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.652" offset="797968">By that I mean there were no lines, no mooring lines, no life jackets, no life tools itself, no rowboats or anything of that nature which could have possibly saved the man if he did in fact go overboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.269" offset="884485">Goett was one of six men who went aboard the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.282" offset="896502">And the first operation to set the ship up for the painting operation itself was to sandblast the deck of the vessel and that of course is equivalent to simply chipping the paint off the deck so that it can be painted on the metal itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.121" offset="963897">Nobody knows exactly what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.337" offset="972675">There was no evidence at all as to why Goett did fall overboard, but the fact remains that one of the men suddenly realized that Goett was missing.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.420" offset="1013008">When he ran over to where he last saw his fellow worker, there was the man in the water and he subsequently did drown although three of the men at various times jumped into the water in an effort to save him.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.519" offset="1069432">Of course, because of the complete absence or lack of any safety equipment, there could be no effort made to save Goett other the men themselves jumping in and to try to do the job.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="255.029" offset="1123453">Where is that statement made in the Court's opinion that when they jumped in, they -- they brought the mop?</text>
            <text syncTime="261.057" offset="1147591">Was -- was there any significance to that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_goldstein" startTime="262.213" stopTime="267.926">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="262.213" offset="1152188">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.625" offset="1153860">That was simply due to the panic of the man himself and the District Court Judge accepted it as such.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="267.926" stopTime="268.334">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="267.926" offset="1175071">Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_goldstein" startTime="268.334" stopTime="648.693">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="268.334" offset="1176743">He could not swim.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.353" offset="1200776">The findings of the District Judge were as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.275" offset="1212479">Number one that it was foreseeable to Carbide that men would go aboard the vessel to do the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.545" offset="1237556">In fact, it was obviously a necessity to do the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.209" offset="1260231">That there was the duty upon Carbide to provide a safe place to work, and that it was negligent for Carbide not to equip the vessel knowing that men who were going aboard had to do the work with some lifesaving equipment, that the barge itself, because of the lack of that equipment was not seaworthy at the time of Goett's death, that the proximate cause of his death was that lack of the equipment involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.728" offset="1382275">The Court then stated that the barge could not be considered to be unmanned at the time of Goett's death because there were men working aboard her, although when the barge was actually in transit, she is unmanned as well as being unpowered.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.957" offset="1447163">She is simply a floating steel tank.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.804" offset="1466598">The Court further stated that at the time of Goett's death, Amherst, the repair yard owner had the exclusive control over the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.435" offset="1513096">And as conclusions of law, the Court stated that the case involved negligence that there was liability because of the fault of Carbide in failing to set forth or place upon the vessel that safety equipment, that the case was not one of liability without fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.654" offset="1597942">And although I would say for a moment that that statement by the Court is open to interpretation, I have interpreted it to mean that the Court found that because of the negligence with fault, found where the liability with fault found against Carbide, the Court then felt it did not have to say there was also liability without fault because it did find that the fault did exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.910" offset="1711000">The Court further stated that there was no contributory negligence because of course being a death case the burden was upon Amherst and Carbide to determine why Goett fell off the vessel and of course there was no evidence ever brought forth as to the reason why he actually fell.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.606" offset="1781844">The Court further stated that there was no assumption of risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.185" offset="1796159">It stated that while Goett may have possibly assumed the risk of falling off the vessel itself the actual falling into the river which was based -- which was the -- the grounding of the case itself, the actual failure to rescue that Goett did not risk at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.151" offset="1888005">He assumed no risk of the failure to rescue itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.971" offset="1923218">Since the case was predicated upon the West Virginia Wrongful Death Statute which had a monetary limitation of $20,000, the Court said that it would find that that monetary limitation was applicable and determined that there was -- there would be an award of $20,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.947" offset="2007124">However, in order to avoid a possible second trial in the matter, we asked the Court and the Court did find an alternative damages under the damages rule of the general maritime law and that was in the sum of $50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.199" offset="2076191">The Court then determined that there was -- should be no indemnification over from Carbide to Amherst because Carbide itself was the party who was actively negligent in failing to place the equipment aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.580" offset="2149648">The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court decision on these grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.980" offset="2191339">Number one, the Court said that there was both negligence and unseaworthiness claimed by the petitioner in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.296" offset="2224567">The Court then said that as far as unseaworthiness was concerned, Goett was not a member of that class to whom the talking of unseaworthiness would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.315" offset="2268662">The Court further stated that it did not agree with the District Court Judge and found that the barge was seaworthy at the time of Goett's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.853" offset="2314742">As for the negligence count, the Court stated that the only duty owed to Goett by Carbide, was to warn Goett of any latent defects not patent defects and that the lack of safety equipment aboard the vessel was obviously known to Goett as well as everyone else and therefore Carbide, had performed its complete duty to Goett and could not be negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.990" offset="2459355">The question of whether or not this Court's decision in the Harrisburg in 1886 was left open since both the District Court and the circuit court felt that it certainly was a matter for this Court to take up.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.927" offset="2527065">The Harrisburg, as this Court well knows, is the decision and as a practical matter the only decision, which has stated that there is no cause of action for wrongful death under the general maritime law, absent a state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.882" offset="2594879">All of the cases which have confirmed or affirmed the -- the doctrine that there is no cause of action for wrongful death have cited the Harrisburg as the prevailing reason for the ruling itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.102" offset="2647751">And so the only -- the only case that is really involved here is the question of whether Harrisburg was a correct enunciation of law by this Court some 60 or 70 years ago.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="648.693" offset="2698115">Is that the only case involved in maritime, that's the only case you have to overcome?</text>

          <turn speaker="harvey_goldstein" startTime="653.765" stopTime="685.731">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="653.765" offset="2718386">Yes, I believe that if I do overcome the Harrisburg decision and that this Court now reverses its ruling in the Harrisburg that there would be I think as a matter of course the statement that there would be a cause of action under the general maritime law for wrongful death even absent a state statute on the subject because all of the cases cited both by this Court and various other courts have uniformly cited the Harrisburg as the controlling case on the subject.</text>

            <text syncTime="690.798" offset="2866552">Well I think Tungus also cited the Harrisburg or if it did not it cited cases which in turn cited Harrisburg as controlling on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.260" offset="2908453">So that we get down to the -- to the point of Harrisburg setting the ruling or setting the pace for the ruling in 1886 and then the -- the cases coming afterward simply citing Harrisburg as the controlling case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harvey Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="721.694" offset="2990164">I would assume so and I hope so.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.176" offset="3024123">In Harrisburg, which was an action in rem, there were three questions set up by the Supreme Court and that was number one, whether or not a cause of action under the maritime law would exist absent a state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.484" offset="3085354">Number two, whether or not there was a remedy if there was a state statute which the general maritime law or the admiralty jurisdiction could then accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.207" offset="3128195">And number three, if the state statute of limitations would then be held applicable in a case arising out of a maritime tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.820" offset="3170617">The Court first freely conceded that under French or under Scottish law, there was a cause of action for wrongful death.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.393" offset="3200920">And they stated that under the English law, as we know there was a common law maxim and that there was no cause of action under British law for wrongful death.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.047" offset="3247522">They then held that they found no case in which any country or any civilized country had a different ruling for a maritime tort as it would have for a tort which occurred on land.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.287" offset="3308544">And therefore since we were a common law nation as was England and England did not have such a right of recovery, that we could then not have a right of recovery either.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.630" offset="3369880">The Court further stated and I find, of course, that this sentence is open to construction, but the Court stated that we must declare what the law is not what it should be or not what we think it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.653" offset="3425991">And I think it's fairly clear that the Court felt that it was setting forth a very, very narrow doctrine on a legalistic or technical point which they felt bound to follow not which what they found would be acceptable to them as an equitable question.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.875" offset="3546885">I think that the question of the reason for the British rule must come under some scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.735" offset="3590353">Certainly, I believe it is well known that under the civil law, under the French Law, under the Scottish Law, in fact under the law of most continental nations which was predicated upon the Roman law there was and always has been a cause of action for wrongful death arising out of a tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.228" offset="3676244">I think it's also conceded that maritime law, as we know today, came into England at a comparatively late date, somewhere around the 12th Century and that at time, the law came into an opposite end of the spectrum so to speak through the common law itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.475" offset="3757223">That is, the maritime law became one of the king's prerogatives and which the king used to attack parliament and the common law which were lined up on the same side.</text>

            <text syncTime="1663.257" offset="6756394">I intend moving to the negligence part of the case right now sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.234" offset="6784293">As to the negligence part of the case itself, since Holley has now determined that the negligence or the duty of Carbide should be determined under maritime law, and not under the state law doctrine, that the decision of the circuit court stating that the sole duty of Carbide was to warn Goett of latent defects could not possibly be applicable to this case since under the general maritime law it's a well-established fact I believe that the duty of any vessel owner is still to provide a safe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.827" offset="6942699">Now the question of whether or not Goett assumed the risk, I think, can be clarified very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.456" offset="6969240">Assuming then, that under the Holley decision, the doctrine of assumption of risk must be determined by maritime law and not state law, it then becomes obvious that under maritime law the test being, whether or not, Goett had a freedom of choice of safe or unsafe conditions, or safe or unsafe equipment, that there was no freedom of choice in this case and that therefore, Goett could not have not assumed the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.209" offset="7104240">One further point as to the question of the $20,000 limitation, under the West Virginia Statute I think that that limitation although the State -- that statute must be taken as a substantive hold is also qualified by the question of whether or not the admiralty forum as can any forum decide that such a limitation is against the public policy of the forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.811" offset="7246660">Now if that is so, and I believe it is, the admiralty forum then has the right and in fact has the duty to determine whether or not that monetary limitation by a foreign forum is then against the public policy of the forum in which the case is being tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.209" offset="7316250">Now that being so, I think the admiralty rule that there should no limitation of money recovery under any circumstances must follow to be applicable here in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.224" offset="7372257">The Workmen case is the major case that I refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.000" offset="7387408">In Workmen, there was a municipal statute in which the City of New York was bound to limit its own liability to $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.793" offset="7434533">The liability in that case exceeded that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.939" offset="7447176">And the question before this Court at that time was whether or not the full indemnification should be paid or whether or not there was indeed the limitation of $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.306" offset="7484583">And this Court stated that it would be in derogation of general maritime rights and duties to say that any State could limit its liability in a case arising within the maritime jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.806" offset="7534634">And I think that case as much as any, simply states for the proposition that there can be no limitation of any recovery in a maritime tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.053" offset="7579564">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles M. Love</label>
            <text syncTime="1887.413" offset="7653021">If Your Honors please, before proceeding with what oral argument I have, I would like to answer Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice's question as to whether or not the state courts have decided this question of what law would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.670" offset="7810069">The state court -- the answer given to you by the counsel for the petitioner was that the Circuit Court of Appeals had decided it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.333" offset="7864717">Now the state courts have not decided it, and the Circuit Court of Appeals has not decided it as to West Virginia yet did in the Holley versus Manfred case decided by the same Court which decided the instant case which is presently before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.384" offset="7956877">With regard to the Virginia statute decided that it would apply admiralty rules but as pointed out by Mr. Justice Stewart that is a different statute and specifically recognizes the rights in rem and against ships which the West Virginia statute does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.146" offset="8055933">I might further point out historically that the Virginia statute was amended after a decision which probably indicated that it should have been amended but it certainly has no effect on West Virginia anymore than -- than a higher statute or a California statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.510" offset="8153422">Now I would like to say to Your Honors that the facts of this case are extremely simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.953" offset="8207235">On a beautiful day in West Virginia, and this is shown by the record that it was 80 degrees and clear in October in 1955 a sandblaster by the name of Marvin Goett, who'd been employed for many months by the Amherst Barge Company which was a company which not only operated barges but for the purposes of this case, it repaired barges, and it had a contract which is in the record, to repair this barge, CC204 owned by Union Carbide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.072" offset="8343698">Marvin Goett, as a sandblaster, was and -- at which occupation he worked for many months was on the deck of this dumb barge as they're sometimes referred to as the plaintiff's counsel referred to it as a floating tank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.149" offset="8416005">It has a flat deck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.826" offset="8422693">It's crowned six inches in the center.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.292" offset="8432515">It has no other superstructure except the pipeline down the middle, and it's simply a -- a floating tank with a flat top subject to that six-inch crown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.341" offset="8480684">It's a 195 feet long and I believe 50 feet wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.731" offset="8506284">Now Mr. Goett was sandblasting on that barge in the afternoon of the second day he'd been working on it and suddenly they noticed he was gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.865" offset="8550797">Nobody knows whether he fell into the river, whether he jumped into the river, whether he was pushed into the river or how it happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.399" offset="8588936">The evidence is simply silent as the plaintiff's counsel requests to this Court and says in his bait, nobody knows how the man got in the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.075" offset="8627702">He was found in the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.007" offset="8643375">Now, whether or not that proved negligence against anybody under any circumstances, I don't know but those are the facts in this case, supplemented to be fair to some extent by the fact that he was seen from one to five minutes before that time using this sandblasting machine which is quite a machine by the way and has two hoses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.857" offset="8738774">It has to be constantly replaced with sand and has power to propel that sand with such force against the object to be cleaned that it will strike off the impurities and defects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.464" offset="8793213">He was wearing not only a hood to protect himself from the sand which came down all over his shoulders and was -- there's some kind of an icing glass or other transparent front on it but also a respirator to keep from breathing the sand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.138" offset="8863953">He had all of those at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.910" offset="8871058">And it is interesting to note that the plaintiff expert in this case, Captain Evagate said that he never saw anybody sandblasting on a tank without wearing a life jacket which Mr. Goett did not have on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.492" offset="8933334">Anyway, he fell into the river and the evidence was that he was in the river from 10 to 15 to 20 minutes before he went down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.988" offset="8987355">The evidence further was that there was a life ring on the digger boat attached to which the barge was attached.</text>

            <text syncTime="2379.755" offset="9622444">The -- this trial court found then the Court of Appeals also that -- the Court of Appeals didn't simply affirmed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.129" offset="9663927">The trial court found that the barge was in the exclusive custody and control of the contracting company, the Amherst Barge Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.978" offset="9703320">I started to say something about the barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.041" offset="9727561">I -- I described it somewhat and I -- I only want to say further that it was turned over to Amherst in exactly the same condition that it was used and had been used since its purchase in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.508" offset="9817422">And there was nothing taken off of the barge and nothing put on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.893" offset="9838947">It was simply delivered as the contract required to the dock and marine ways of the Amherst Barge Company for these repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.961" offset="9883251">Whether these repairs were major or minor, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.111" offset="9903835">I do know that it -- they cost about 10% of the original cost of the barge therefore I think it would be safe to say that original cost to something over $48,000 and the cost of these of repairs was $4700 and something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.254" offset="9968410">I don't know that that is material, but anyway, it was delivered to Amherst in exactly the same condition that it was operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.366" offset="10004877">On that particular point, Your Honors will remember that it is the contention of the petitioners that not only that we should deliver the barge as it is but that we should do something special to the barge as to the barge when actually it is being taken out of navigation and being delivered to a contractor for work extensive enough to require dry docking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.471" offset="10133295">Now the history of this litigation pretty well told Your Honors by the plaintiff's, the petitioner's attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.679" offset="10174046">This was action was brought on the law side of -- on the civil side, I should say, in the federal court in the Southern District of West Virginia and after it was brought against Union Carbide only, Union Carbide filed a third party complaint as it could under the federal rules bringing in the contractor, the barge company and then answering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.512" offset="10309465">The case pend -- was pending for -- I don't something over a year but it was transferred into admiralty on the day of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.643" offset="10353977">Now it is true that some two weeks prior to that time, the Court had announced it would sustain a motion then made to transfer the case into admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.868" offset="10410820">I repeat that not because I think it is of much importance, but because I think it points up to some extent what we are discussing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.169" offset="10480097">I listen as I'm sure Your Honors did to the attack upon the Harrisburg and not only upon the Harrisburg I might say but upon the dozens of cases cited in footnote number one of our brief following the rule laid down by the Harrisburg and insinuating that this is a great social or moral problem which is being presented to the Court at this time and that here is a wrong which cries out for righting and in injustice concerning which something should be done as extreme as to overrule many cases of this Court or even one case of this Court and to ignore at least two acts of Congress which have touched upon the matter, significantly.</text>
