            <text syncTime="15.400" offset="164968">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.080" offset="179702">I hope this case will be a welcome change from the last case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.348" offset="200808">We have a very -- a very short record.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.463" offset="213243">We have two briefs of 40 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.313" offset="224632">We have no conflict in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.600" offset="233723">The only questions before the Court are questions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.558" offset="249605">Now, this is a Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.934" offset="263084">It was brought in the District Court of Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.112" offset="279803">And after a full trial, mostly on stipulated facts, the District Judge dismissed the case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.970" offset="319300">An appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.357" offset="344795">The action was brought to recover substantial $100,000 damages for the wrongful death of the man named Graham.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.731" offset="394324">And on October 20, 1954, he was employed as a carpenter by a Mr. Robert Larson and Larson had a contract with the United States for the repair of the baffle-deck of one-half of the baffle-deck of the spillway deck of the Bonneville Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.390" offset="500903">Your Honors, you may again see a map here, the spillway dam on the Columbia River is right here, the baffle-deck is a concrete structure that takes the flow of water which comes through the gates down there, and this -- in the period between 1938 when the dam was constructed in 1954 when this contract would last.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.051" offset="619604">There seemed to be a great deal of erosion of the deck and of the baffles which were constructed to dissipate the velocity of the water, these big concrete baffles.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.929" offset="667042">So Mr. Larson had this contract with the United States and Graham was his employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.754" offset="706435">Now, under the contract, the contract contemplated that the operations of the dam would be carried on at all times in the regular manner by the corps of engineers, these employees of the United States, and that they were, of course, in exclusive and complete charge of lowering and raising the gates of the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.901" offset="827016">There are 18 spillways all the way down to the Washington side, number one down to the Oregon side, number 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.030" offset="871528">And they are -- these gates, which are about 50 feet by 50 feet, rest on a so-called “ogee section” above the deck, and they are moved by big cranes that move across the base of the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.900" offset="974973">Now, Your Honors, the contractor contemplated that he was would go in and build a timber crib right in this section here at gate nine.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.773" offset="1042474">And -- that then he would complete all these copper dams right around and then he would pump the water out of this section so that he could expose the surface of the baffle-deck and proceed to do his extensive repair work.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.392" offset="1120946">And of course, he was required by the contract at all times to consult with the employees of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.711" offset="1178206">There was a man named Caps (ph) who was in charge of the operation of the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.533" offset="1201507">And then, there was a man named Patrick Leonti who was the liaison man.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.666" offset="1230033">And it was up to Larson, and he did confer with Mr. Leonti and he told them what he expected to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.700" offset="1274128">And this accident -- this very tragic accident in which four men were drowned occurred when he was just commencing his contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.922" offset="1343091">Now, what he proposed to do and what he told the United States he was going to do was to find out by a sounding operation just how this baffle-deck had been eroded in this section so that he could construct a timber crib on land and take it out and sink it and it would be on the right section underneath.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.428" offset="1449044">And so he told the United States that he wanted to take a tugboat and a barge and go up there and anchor or lash a barge in by the phase of the dam and take these soundings.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.103" offset="1523754">And in connection with that -- at that -- at that time, the -- these gates, 11 to 18 were closed and that created a quiet pool in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.925" offset="1575058">Larson asked (Inaudible) gates 10 and 11 on the day that he was going to -- his men were going to do this operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.406" offset="1616959">And that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.217" offset="1628244">But gates eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one were open.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.516" offset="1657396">They're opened to a certain extent and the evidence conclusively shows that the velocity of the water coming through these gates, immediately in the stations to where this operation was going to be carried on was about 30 miles an hour, a tremendous flow of water coming through there.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.045" offset="1875571">Well, I think the -- the evidence shows that gate eight, for instance, was opened 32 inches and the water was coming through there at 5700 cubic feet per second.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.670" offset="1926040">And gate seven was opened 55 inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.863" offset="1938787">And -- and the water was coming through at 9100 cubic feet per second.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.759" offset="1958431">Gate six was opened 32 inches and water was coming through at 5700 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.759" offset="1982360">I haven't got the figures on the actual discharge of the water in gate five (Inaudible) gate one, but the main water was -- was coming through on gates eight, seven and six.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.856" offset="2046830">On the date of the accident then, and these are all stipulated facts, they're in the findings of fact, the -- Larson assembled this crew and told them what to do and sent them out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.202" offset="2104195">And with the tug, pushed a barge up, and they started here, and they went around here, and they went up into the river into the spillway section.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.787" offset="2170546">At this time, of course, there was no cause for them to this -- it was a quiet pool of water in here and the velocity was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.929" offset="2203042">And they got up to this bay nine and to make the long story short, the boat and barge and tug started to yoke, got into the turbulent current in front of gate eight and immediately capsized, turned right over and all these men were drowned.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.907" offset="2310980">One -- one escaped.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.287" offset="2320488">Their three cases were consolidated under the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.785" offset="2350477">The other two cases now are pending in the Court of Appeals, and it's been stipulated that the decision in this case will govern the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.787" offset="2398542">Now, the petitioner, I, of course, represent the administrator of the estate of Mr. Graham but the cause of actions for the benefit of the real minor children, the suit was brought in to the District Court on two -- under two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.812" offset="2466670">First, the regular Lord Campbell's Act of Oregon, Oregon long possessed statutes that time at $15,000 limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.215" offset="2504182">Secondly, a special statutory cause of action for wrongful death created by the Oregon Employers' Liability Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.834" offset="2550680">This latter argument statute provides in substance that owners and contractors responsible for work involving risk and danger shall use every device, care and precaution which is practical for the use for the protection of -- and safety of life and limb limited only by the necessity for preserving the efficiency of the operation of the structure and without regard to additional cause of suitable material or safety appliances and devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.682" offset="2674082">Now, the District Court held, as a matter of fact, that under the Oregon Wrongful Death Act, the Government was not guilty of negligence.And secondly, it held that to apply this Oregon statute which creates this by degree of care every -- every device care and proportion would append the so-called Jensen doctrine or it'd be unconstitutional to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="756.603" offset="3129762">We're -- I'm raising in this -- we're raising in this Court the one legal question, whether or not the lower court erred in holding, as a matter of law, that the Employers' Liability Act of Oregon could not be applied to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.953" offset="3207189">Of course, the underlying feature was that this death was a drowning.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.267" offset="3236446">Therefore, it was on navigable waters of the United States, and -- and therefore, general maritime law applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.679" offset="3270092">Now, I have three main arguments, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.249" offset="3280332">The first one is the fact that we're in here, in the Court's on Federal Tort Claims Act, which provides for the liability of the United States for death on account of negligent acts or omissions of government employees under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.306" offset="3404570">And we say that by using that peculiar statutory phrase, law of the place where the act or omission occurred rather than the law where the injury or death occurred, that Congress intended to change the ordinary conflicts of law rules and federal tort claims at cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1128.178" offset="4616129">Now, going on to another argument, we say that in any event, apart from this interpretation of the Tort Claims Act that to apply the Employers' Liability Act does not work material prejudice to characteristic features of the maritime law or interfere with the uniformity of that law because any wrongful death statute that is applied that does that to a greater or lesser extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.708" offset="4770252">Actually, this -- this device, care and precaution, every device, care and precaution standards of the Oregon Act is not very much different from the doctrine of unseaworthiness which, of course, in absolute non-delegable duty to furnish a seaworthy ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.799" offset="4834617">And that duty is not satisfied just because the shipowner may use reasonable care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.762" offset="4862412">The incidents of this Employers' Liability Act are much closer to principles of general maritime law.They're applied in admiralty courts because in the Oregon Wrongful Death Act, you have contributory negligence as a complete defense, the function of risk as a complete defense and in the Employers' Liability Act, contributory negligence is only in mitigation of damages, assumption of risk is no defense, negligence, at all, serving is no defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.659" offset="4977977">So that from a point of view of prejudice of a state statute to maritime law, it has been assuming that maritime law might -- might govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.415" offset="5037014">We don't see that -- that we have a situation which requires a rejection of a -- of a state statute if it's applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.815" offset="5086647">Now, apart -- then, Your Honor, after the petitioner for writ was filed, the Court wrote two opinions that we think are very relevant to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.095" offset="5139728">And one is Tungus versus Skovgaard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.178" offset="5160103">And that decision of the Court shows that a wrongful death statute must be applied as an integrated whole, and that to do so, does not interfere or -- or prejudice the uniformity of maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.039" offset="5239515">So if you take this Oregon -- the argument's been made, of course, that while you take the remedy of the Oregon Employers' Liability Act and then you apply the standards of general maritime law, something like that, but that whole idea was rejected by this Court in the Tungus case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.684" offset="5310151">And there -- and therefore, if -- if the Oregon Employers' Liability Act is otherwise applicable, then it must be applied in entirety, in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.780" offset="5374516">And to do so, it doesn't offend the uniformity of maritime law, and of course, the principle behind all that is that -- that there was no remedy for wrongful death that -- in admiralty, and therefore, the state statutes will avoid, and that there are many cases on that, some of which is cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.642" offset="5465945">Then an entirely different principle is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.849" offset="5486738">That the case of Hahn versus Ross Island Sand &amp; Gravel Company where this Court reversed the argument of the Supreme Court is -- is the embodiment of the Oregon law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.641" offset="5541909">It's not the Oregon Supreme Court's opinion in that case because that's been reversed and taken out, so that this Court's opinion is -- is the Oregon law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.204" offset="5580152">And there, the Court held under fairly similar facts, in other words, I think our case is found there, that Mr. Hahn who had a job repairing a barge on navigable waters in the Willamette River, his -- he went onboard a barge to -- and climbed up a ladder to repair some winch up there and he fell off the ladder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.787" offset="5710555">That -- that his employment and the character of that tort was local in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.531" offset="5749530">And here, we say that this whole controversy is local in nature that we're not dealing with a ship, it has nothing to do with commerce or vessels going from port to port down up the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.743" offset="5826330">We have the dam that just sits there on the Columbia River and it never moves and -- and there's no -- and -- and this fellow Graham was not a seaman, he's -- he was a carpenter, and he just happened to be out that day on the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.839" offset="5890696">Mostly the work requires would -- under the contract, it must be done in here, commencing his work when the water was taken out, and this is the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.817" offset="5926640">That was upon the purpose of -- of this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.779" offset="5946493">And so if -- certainly if Hahn was in the twilight zone, I'd say that Mr. Graham was also, and of course, it's the nature of the general employment and employers-employees' activities at the time of death which governs, there's been an argument here that -- well, the statute says that the Bonneville Dam is an aid of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.222" offset="6048266">And that's what the statute says, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.532" offset="6057462">But the aid to navigation of the Bonneville Dam I was -- it was the zip lock that was put in to here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.482" offset="6089331">Certainly, the dam was not an aid to navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.632" offset="6097899">It's an instruction to navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.948" offset="6107199">It's been -- it's been recognized or dams have been recognized as instructions in navigation in -- in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.244" offset="6140322">So the question remains then, Your Honors, whether under the findings of fact made by the employers by the -- by the Court, District Court, affirmed, and -- and the Court of Appeals, the -- this fellow, Graham, is entitled to the protection of the Oregon Employers' Liability Act remembering that he is not an employee of the United States, and remembering that the liability of the United States is the same as a private person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.747" offset="6278353">And this is quite an intricate question of Oregon law if the Court will see when it reviews the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.709" offset="6302177">But we say that the Oregon cases show five basic criteria which are all met under the undisputed findings of fact that the conclusion of the District Court that he wasn't entitled, as a matter of fact, to the protection of the Act was induced by erroneous conclusion of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.430" offset="6409070">Now, under the Oregon cases, a plaintiff must be an employee of someone and must have relation towards the defendant different from that of a member of the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.947" offset="6463195">And that's what this thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.955" offset="6467166">He was employed by contract in working for -- for the United States, for his employer but he wasn't a member of the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.207" offset="6504155">And his duties must require his presence in the vicinity of a hazardous condition and a working button must involve risk and danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.069" offset="6531636">There's no question that -- that those -- that that condition was fulfilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.316" offset="6552639">Now, the defendant must be an employer, and the United States was an employer of people on the Bonneville Dam, and there must be a common purpose or mutual benefit in the relationship between the defendant and the plaintiff's employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.918" offset="6603003">And here, this contract is the tie between the United States and the plaintiff's and decedent's employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.302" offset="6640619">Now, then, most important, the defendant, under these Oregon cases, particularly Myers versus Staub, 201 Oregon, the defendant must have had primary control over the instrumentalities in use which is the media of injuries or death giving rise to the claims for damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.281" offset="6708537">And that is the situation here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1815.206" offset="7364211">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.965" offset="7375182">I would like at the outset to add one or two facts to those stated by Mr. Cory in order to bring the entire factual situation in what we regard as -- should be a part of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.065" offset="7419591">The arrangement between the United States or rather its project engineer and the representatives of Larson was that, when Larson wished additional gates closed, it was to advise the project engineer who would in turn relay that request to the operational personnel of the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.791" offset="7502555">Now, the -- Mr. Cory points out the Larson representatives requested the closing of two additional gates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.405" offset="7537037">Those two gates were closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.350" offset="7544769">There was no other request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.683" offset="7554069">And additionally, the day before the accident, the superintendent of the Larson Company undertook personally a reconnaissance trip along the area where the sounding operation is where to be undertaken, to ascertain for himself whether or not, the soundings could be taken safely with the gates closed, the number of gates closed which have been requested to be closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.554" offset="7657618">On the basis of that reconnaissance trip, the Larson superintendent decided for himself that the operation would be safe with the gates closed as requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.818" offset="7702653">And we think that that forms the basis for -- the basis for District Court's alternative holding of this case that the Employers' Liability Act was inapplicable in terms, because the work was from beginning to end, in charge, the District Court found, all the independent contractors that all that the United States was interested in was in the accomplishment of the general result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.863" offset="7806830">Now, the basic position of the Government here this afternoon is first, that this is beyond any question, an action on a maritime tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.341" offset="7848730">Second, that if this were an action between private parties, the liability of the defendant would be measured by the reasonable care standard of both the maritime law and the Oregon Wrongful Death Act, which standard was applied by the District Court here, rather than by the strict standard of the Oregon Employers' Liability Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.958" offset="7935248">And third, that since the United States is liable under the Tort Act, only to the same extent as a private party would be in like circumstances, the Employers' Liability Law is similarly inapplicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.747" offset="7994389">But we do not understand the petitioner to challenge here, that if this action were between private parties, this suit would clearly be within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.541" offset="8041514">The critical fact from that standpoint is, of course, that the injurious force, in this case the turbulent waters which caused the tug to capsize, came into contact with and caused the death of the decedent on the -- on navigable waters of the State of Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.754" offset="8110373">Now, we concede, of course, that merely because this case is within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, it does not necessarily follow that state law is completely inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.719" offset="8162200">As we note in our brief and as this Court pointed out in the Romero case last year, there are certain incidents of maritime relationships to which state laws maybe validly applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.050" offset="8211623">But we are dealing here with one particular aspect of the maritime relationship, and that aspect is the standards of substantive tort liability, which are to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.883" offset="8258853">And we submit, if the Court pleases, that as to this area, this Court has never permitted state law to determine substantive tort liability for an injury on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.092" offset="8303783">Now, we are going through, of course, in our brief --</text>

            <text syncTime="2095.397" offset="8484968">It -- I think that what this Court held in the Tungus case was simply that since you are invoking a state-created remedy, you must take it subject to whatever conditions or limitations the State may have imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.422" offset="8545050">And I wish to point out in this connection in -- in the Halecki case where the question -- one of the questions was whether or not, the warranty of unseaworthiness or warranty of seaworthiness rather, extended to the -- to the victim in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.770" offset="8618402">This Court on that question turned to the federal cases, Pope &amp; Talbot versus Hawn to the Sieracki case in determining whether or not, there had been a breach of duty upon the part of the defendant, that it was a federal maritime law that defined the scope of the duty of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.624" offset="8709831">And that again, the -- the reference to the state law came in into the context as -- you have to enforce for state remedy as you find it and if the State does impose conditions or limitations upon recovery, for example, as the question in the scope by itself as to whether the state act was sufficiently broad to -- to encompass a claim for unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.626" offset="8797915">Those questions are questions of state law, but we submit that there was nothing in the -- the Tungus or in Halecki or in any of the other decisions of this Court which suggest that a state wrongful death act maybe invoked to enforce a claim which would not have been recognized in admiralty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2385.442" offset="9645119">But once it has been determined that there is a breach of the -- the maritime law -- of the duty imposed by the maritime law, then the question becomes whether the State has created a remedy for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.801" offset="9698617">Now, to the extent that -- that their inconsistency here, of course, all stems from the fact that it is still the -- the law that admiralty itself does not recognize the cause of action for wrongful death and that you have to import a state law to provide that remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.501" offset="9773328">But we suggest though that in order to, again, in order to invoke the state remedy, you first have to ascertain whether or not there was a breach of a duty recognized by the maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.230" offset="9816273">Now, otherwise, you would have a -- a situation where the -- the individual had he survived and gone into a court of admiralty or had invoked a remedy under the savings to suitors clause, would not have been entitled to recovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="3263.913" offset="13159006">That's -- well, as I understood it, in the Kermarec case in the lower courts, the lower courts held that since this accident occurred in the navigable waters in New York, as to the vessel had berthed in the New York harbor, that the shipowner was only liable if he had known of -- actually known of the defect and had failed to warn the -- the visitor of that defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.484" offset="13285334">But that wasn't one of the bases on which the -- the plaintiff in that case lost with this application of New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.201" offset="13308217">And this Court, as I understand it, held that no, that the -- the Court should not have invoked that New York standard, not only should not have, could not, and that the action was governed by the reasonable care standard of the maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.892" offset="13370911">And that was the question here is whether the shipowner had -- had exercised reasonable care.</text>

            <text syncTime="3332.607" offset="13433814">That -- that's correct, but we suggest that it does not make any difference in -- in this area as to whether it's a wrongful death or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.639" offset="13469968">We would suggest that certainly, at the time of Western Fuel Company versus Garcia in this whole doctrine with respect to importing a wrongful death act or state law death act, to provide a remedy on a maritime tort but it was never thought that the result of this would be that in using the state act, the individual could recover on a claim which would not have been recognized in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.363" offset="13588773">And again, that -- on the other side of this was just simply a matter here, but since you are invoking a -- a state-created remedy, that you have to take a remedy subject to whatever limitations the State has placed upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.880" offset="13646869">Now, I would like to point -- point to this, and that is that this Court may recall in the Halecki case, the Second Circuit, in construing New Jersey law, came to the conclusion that the New Jersey courts, if faced with a seaworthiness claim under a wrongful death act, would not invoke to contributory negligence doctrine that would be invoked if it were with respect to a non-maritime tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.515" offset="13761390">Since the time of the Halecki case, the Fourth Circuit has come to precisely the same conclusion with respect to the Virginia Wrongful Death Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.240" offset="13824293">That the Virginia Wrongful Death Act, when being invoked on a maritime tort, the Virginia courts would impose the same conditions or -- and limitations of the maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.545" offset="13865566">And this was without any -- any -- Virginia decision points or it well may be that this -- this problem that has arisen because of the necessity of taking in the conditions of limitations will not in practice prove as a serious one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.938" offset="13923140">And there will be in the final analysis that under the Wrongful Death Act, you will have on both sides of it, both in terms of the creation of liability and also in terms of the conditions and limitations, the application of the -- the maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.925" offset="13979042">And I think that that would be, of course, a desirable result in terms of the uniformity doctrine which this Court has consistently applied.</text>
