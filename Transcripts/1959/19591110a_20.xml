            <text syncTime="31.895" offset="230902">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.129" offset="243858">The principal issue in this case which is here on direct appeal to the District Court for the District of Columbia is whether certain actions taken by the appellee, one of the country's major pharmaceutical manufacturers in attempt to maintain resale prices in the District of Columbia and in Richmond, Virginia, amounted to an illegal conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of the Sherman Act or whether as the District Court held in dismissing the case at the close of the Government's evidence, Parke Davis' actions did not amount to a conspiracy but constituted no more than the unilateral selection of its customers which is permissible under the doctrine of United States against Colgate &amp; Co.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.230" offset="428283">The Government's civil complaint in this case charged Parke Davis with violating Sections 1 and 3 of the Sherman Act and the District Court as I say dismissed it on the ground that no conspiracy had been established and alternatively, the Court concluded that even if violations had been established, there was no need for injunctive relief because he found there was no reasonable probability that these attempts to maintain resale prices might be repeated in the future.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="116.333" offset="568717">No, Mr. Justice, he dismissed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.263" offset="584391">Parke Davis has accused the Government in this case of bringing an antitrust case before this Court for a trial de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.044" offset="615528">They say that all the factual issues were determined adversely to the Government before the District Court and that should be the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.491" offset="649383">Now, I want to emphatically deny that we are asking this Court to retry the factual issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.758" offset="678431">As I believe my brief statement of the facts will show, we don't think there's any real dispute into -- in this case as to what Parke Davis in fact did.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.488" offset="717302">I don't think there's any denial of the actual operative facts in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.330" offset="736737">The critical issue is whether these actions taken by Parke Davis amounted to a conspiracy and that is the legal inferences to be drawn from the particular course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.326" offset="796714">Now, the case grew out of an attempt in 1956 by Parke Davis to stop price cutting by certain retailers in the District of Columbia and in the City of Richmond, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.027" offset="851466">At the time of this action, neither the District of Columbia nor Virginia was a fair trade area.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.333" offset="880724">So that, at that time, had Parke Davis attempted to enter into resale price maintenance with these individuals, the contracts would have been illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.630" offset="921893">Parke Davis' distribution system entails selling directly to the retailers, primarily from its Baltimore area office, and also selling to certain selected wholesalers in the area and the wholesalers then in turn sell to the retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.718" offset="986258">However, since Parke Davis gives quantity discounts, which it does not permitted wholesaler to give, it is cheaper to the retailers to purchase directly from Parke Davis than to purchase through the wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.505" offset="1041429">Now, the principal activities of Parke Davis in this case were taken against five retailers in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.180" offset="1084061">Parke Davis emphasized that they are only five out of some 200 involved because the five retailers who were singled out were the leaders in this price cutting campaign and that's why Parke Davis took action against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.869" offset="1138813">The Parke Davis price policy towards the retail stores is set out in its price list and the Parke Davis price list policy states that in areas having Fair Trade Laws, these prices are to be followed and in areas which do not have Fair Trade Laws, these prices are suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.885" offset="1218957">In June of 1956, the manager of the Parke Davis' Baltimore office attended a meeting of the company at the company's headquarters in Detroit and at that time he raised the question what they could do about this price cutting that is going on in the district, and he was he told by the president of the company that they had a policy that they would not sell to price-cutting retailers in non-fair trade areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.795" offset="1330552">When he returned from his meeting in Detroit, the branch manager called in his area manager for Washington and instructed this area manager to go and cut off these price cutting retailers if they refused to conform to Parke Davis' policy and at the same time also tell them to see to it that the wholesalers cut off any of the retailers who refused to go along with this policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.486" offset="1457298">In 19 -- early in July 1956, the Parke Davis representatives visited a number of these price cutting retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.886" offset="1498885">They advised these price cutting retailers that Parke Davis had this policy of selling only to people who observed the state of resale prices and furthermore, warned them that if they didn't stop this practice of price cutting, Parke Davis would cut them off on its own direct sales and would also cut them off on the sales to wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.127" offset="1591881">In several instances, when they spoke to the retailers, they also advised them that they were seeing other retailers in the areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.630" offset="1625840">Five of these people who were approached, refused to stop price cutting.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.285" offset="1644544">Parke Davis then cut them off on direct sales and also told the wholesalers or requested the wholesalers to stop selling to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.471" offset="1693236">Now, Parke Davis suggests that all it did in approaching the retailers and the wholesalers was to announce its policy to them and that's its basic defense in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.328" offset="1736704">They said, "We have a policy, we wouldn't sell to you, and we just announced this policy and left it up to them to decide what to do.”</text>
            <text syncTime="418.059" offset="1775574">I would like to read to the Court the testimony, two sentences from one of the wholesalers, it's at page 198 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.658" offset="1814026">This is the vice president of one of the wholesalers who was describing his conversations with the Parke Davis representatives when they came to visit them, at the top of page 198 and after he was asked if he could stop selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.322" offset="1876616">Question, “What did you tell them, sir?”</text>
            <text syncTime="445.397" offset="1884975">Answer, "I asked them if they were requesting it of me alone or would they go to the other wholesalers, and they said they would visit the local wholesalers and then I agreed to abide by it” and he repeated the same statement later on at page 206.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.442" offset="1961148">So, that we think at this initial stage of approaching the -- the wholesalers and the retailers, Parke Davis then and there did far more than just announcing its policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.483" offset="2009318">The testimony of, Mr. Grips, the area manager of Parke Davis in Baltimore is to the effect that he instructed his man to go and request them to give this out.</text>

            <text syncTime="535.570" offset="2245674">The District Court seemingly as far as we can tell, based his decision on the erroneous, we believe, legal conclusion that absent anything in a way of specific agreements, this conduct was perfectly permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.205" offset="2304188">Parke Davis did not put in its case.</text>

            <text syncTime="566.329" offset="2368658">-- of the testimony except to one extent and we do challenge the finding to the extent that it suggests that Parke Davis did not discuss with the individuals that visited, what it was doing with respect to the other ones and that finding, we think is somewhat ambiguous, but we are not attacking in this case, the any -- with two miles exception to the specific findings in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.001" offset="2463326">We are challenging what we believe to be the conclusory findings that all of these did not amount to an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.959" offset="2487254">That is our basic attack on the District Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.014" offset="2503450">With one brief exception after Parke Davis had visited the retailers and the wholesalers, the retailers were unable to buy any Parke Davis products for approximately seven weeks, although there is evidence by the wholesalers that a few orders might have been filled.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.083" offset="2579728">Now, we then skip to the end of August at which point the retailers had been cutoff on Parke Davis products.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.126" offset="2619852">On that day, the two principal officials of the Baltimore office of Parke Davis, on their own initiative, visited three of the price-cutting retailers in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.267" offset="2668440">The first man they went to was the president of the Dart Drug Company, a Mr. Haft.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.366" offset="2692786">There's a disagreement into the testimony as to where the suggestion emanated, but it is conceded that at that meeting it was suggested that if Mr. Haft would take down this sign, these advertisements in the windows cutting prices that Parke Davis would then resume shipping to him and at the point, Mr. -- and also the, some of the newspaper ads, at that point, Mr. Haft indicated that this was agreeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.466" offset="2801246">They then left Mr. Haft and went to each of the two -- two other price cutters in the area and they told each of these individuals that they had discussed the matter with Haft and it was agreeable to Haft to take down his signs if Parke Davis would resume selling to them and queried them whether they would be willing to go along with such a proposal and each of these individuals in effect said yes, they would if the others were doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.305" offset="2908557">After these visits, the stores took down their signs although they were free under Parke Davis' suggestion to continue selling their products inside and Parke Davis resumed selling to them and also notified the wholesalers that the wholesalers might again resume selling to the price-cutting retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.621" offset="2997896">And of course the importance of the advertising and the signs is that if you are a price cutter, it's obviously terribly important that that fact be brought home to the members of the consuming public.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.442" offset="3049096">For a period of about two-and-half months thereafter, with one exception again which apparently was inadvertent, there was no price-cutting advertising in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.619" offset="3093817">In the middle of November, the situation as Parke Davis described, it blew up again when one of these people again ran an ad and thereafter, the price cutting again resumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.208" offset="3140211">Now, these facts that I have stated, I believe are basically not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.493" offset="3165393">I mean, Parke Davis does not deny that it approached the retailers and said it would cut them off, that it went to the wholesalers and it told the wholesalers that was dealing with others that it requested the wholesalers to cut them off on that on its own initiative, it subsequently approached the retailers and suggested a modification of the situation as it had existed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1035.444" offset="4245191">Now, I'd like to come to the basic law in this field which we think is the basic principles are not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.701" offset="4290226">The Colgate case as it has been interpreted by this Court subsequently, has very strictly limited a right to the manufacturer in refusing to sell, where refusal to sell is a means of enforcing resale price maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.112" offset="4383848">The cases have indicated that the manufacturer's right is limited to an announcement of the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.881" offset="4410911">They may announce in advance the policy, the conditions under which they will not sell and they will also -- may also cut off, refuse to deal with someone who does not exceed to that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.489" offset="4469321">The cases have also indicated, however, that a manufacturer cannot go beyond the simple right of refusing to sell and announcing his policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.500" offset="4509341">Now, we think that in this case, what the record shows is something far more than unilateral action by Parke Davis in announcing a policy and refusing to deal with individuals who fail to comply with that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.742" offset="4582379">In the first place, Parke Davis cut off the wholesalers, the retailers and refused to deal with them when they didn't accede to its policy, it didn't stop at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.665" offset="4633997">It then went to the wholesalers and told the wholesalers that they too must stop selling to Parke Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.902" offset="4670986">This in simple antitrust language is what is called a boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.932" offset="4695124">Parke Davis in combination with the wholesalers brought the economic pressure to bear on the retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.892" offset="4730964">The evidence shows that the wholesalers were not only told of this fact, but were told -- not only requested to do this but were also advised that other wholesalers were being brought into this thing and this Court has repeatedly found that -- held the conscious participation in a common plan where the aim of the plan is restraint of trade is enough to establish a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.396" offset="4832946">The evidence further shows that the brining of the wholesalers into the case was an integral part of the whole plan at the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.620" offset="4869831">The manager of Parke Davis' Baltimore branch told his assistant to bring pressure to bear not only on the retailers but on the wholesalers and the retailers in turn were warned, that if they didn't go along with Parke Davis, not only would they be cut off on purchases from Parke Davis but also on purchases from the wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.116" offset="4967842">Now, the participation of the wholesalers was of course a vital element in the whole plan because as long as the retailers had an alternative source of supply available, even at a somewhat higher price, there wouldn't be any very effective pressure on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.420" offset="5045060">It was only when Parke Davis brought to bear the combined force of cutting them off directly and also indirectly that this thing would have a really vital pinch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.714" offset="5090200">And finally, we think the situation is doubly significant because not only did Parke Davis request the wholesalers not to sell to the retailers, but it didn't give them the green light to resume selling until after the retailers had indicated that they would take down their signs and stop their advertising.</text>

            <text syncTime="1654.931" offset="6723062">I -- I would like to refer briefly to one of the aspect of this case at this time which is the District Court's alternative holding that even if a conspiracy had been established, there was no need for any injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.933" offset="6787114">The District Court based that holding on three different grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.926" offset="6803101">First, the District Court held that the practices had been abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.666" offset="6818043">And then it went on to say the abandonment had been made in good faith and has been forced upon the company by the economic and business conditions in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.200" offset="6856182">And that in fact, the company could not resume these practices without heavy economic loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.290" offset="6880528">Now, the only thing shown by this record as to the reason for abandonment is the testimony of Parke Davis' Assistant General Attorney that one of the reasons for abandonment was this antitrust investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.010" offset="6947401">There is nothing in this record to show that Parke Davis could not resume these practices without heavy loss or that they were forced upon it, this abandonment was forced on it by business and economic conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.191" offset="7000168">There is not even in this record a disclaimer by Parke Davis that it will not resume these challenged practices in the future, unlike the Grant case where the men involved in the interlocking the record state that he would not resume.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.987" offset="7055339">There's no such evidence at all in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.248" offset="7064325">All that we had basically here is abandonment resulting in part from the investigation conducted by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.192" offset="7096090">And we think that it's well settled that the mere fact of abandonment alone is not sufficient to deny the Government the right to injunctive relief and we think that on this face of the case too, the District Court erred in the case should be remanded for further proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1915.691" offset="7766183">The principal witness here, Mr. Haft, who was the complaining witness to the antitrust division was working under the careful guidance of his own counsel looking forward to treble damage case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1941.440" offset="7869106">Now, our position is simply this that we instructed our salesmen, Parke Davis instructed our salesmen to got out and say to the trade the following.</text>

            <text syncTime="1978.171" offset="8016018">The Court found that those were the instructions and the Court also found that's exactly what the salesmen did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.718" offset="8050291">Now, I can't conceive of anything that is purer Colgate than that, a simple statement, announcement of the policy and a carrying out of that policy in accordance with the instructions that were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.327" offset="8108701">And those instructions incidentally, are shown by this record to have been given to these people under confident legal advice as to what the guideposts were under this Colgate doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.686" offset="8162095">Now I say to you that the Colgate doctrine is not some theoretical abstract idea, but this is a rule that has guided businessmen ever since the case came down and it's an integral part of our commercial life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.478" offset="8233253">And when these people who are responsible businessmen went about it with regard to their right to select their customer and the Court found that is all they did then it seems to me the findings must be sustained below, and there is no basis here for upsetting the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.539" offset="8313501">Now, let's examine what the government says are the reasons why this case must be upset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.385" offset="8352893">They -- they say as I understand them in effect that a legal implication of agreement is essential here because of two aspects of the conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.701" offset="8406183">One, that the Colgate doctrine was applied as to wholesalers and the second, that some of these customers were reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.828" offset="8454666">Now, those are the two points that would make you an argument today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.570" offset="8469608">There were wholesalers in the Colgate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.799" offset="8482565">There were wholesalers in the Beech-Nut case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.839" offset="8494686">This Court has never said that the Colgate doctrine doesn't apply to wholesalers just as much as it does to any other class of customer or trade.</text>

            <text syncTime="2134.101" offset="8639822">There were also wholesalers in Beech-Nut when the decree there was passed in by the Court, there was no prohibition against defying the Colgate rule to wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.034" offset="8683499">Now, counsel here says, you -- this is a boycott, and that's simply an example of the use of a nasty word to get over a deficiency in his proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.967" offset="8747238">If we reach an agreement with the wholesalers for concerted action, of course it would have been a boycott, but the question is, did we reach an agreement or did we as the Court found merely say to these wholesalers, “If you sell to price-cutting retailer, we'll cut you off.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.535" offset="8825501">That is no boycott, that's merely the exercise of a Colgate right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.967" offset="8847235">And when they suggest to you it's a boycott, they jump over the fact that the Court throughout here found there was no agreement of that kind with the wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.508" offset="8885373">Of course, if there was an agreement with the wholesalers, you don't have to call it a boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.269" offset="8900420">It doesn't come within Colgate anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.699" offset="8910137">It's a price of arrangement and it's improper, but there was no such agreement on these findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.528" offset="8941484">Now, I -- I think that perhaps what I can do here is to put this case in a bit more perspective than you had it today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.944" offset="8987146">In the first place what we're concerned with here is a case that involved conduct in this District of Columbia area for a period of about six or eight months at the most, in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.455" offset="9057155">We -- counsel referred Parke Davis as one of the leading drug company, it's what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.475" offset="9085262">The record shows that in this market it had about 5% of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.432" offset="9117132">It had no system of policing, no card-index system, no marked goods, no cooperative arrangement with its wholesalers or its jobbers, no system of licensing, no joint trade activities of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.995" offset="9187349">This -- this company was simply going ahead selling here in the District of Columbia like its many competitors and there was as between them very substantial price competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.308" offset="9236564">What happened was, that a man by the name of Haft who ran Dart Drug Company, a -- a corporate drug house here in -- in Washington, began to advertise very substantial, very deep price cuts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.350" offset="9308766">The District Court found that that completely demoralized Parke Davis' trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.153" offset="9335933">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.544" offset="9341576">Because when Mr. Haft advertised these deep price cuts, he was not advertising for the purpose of selling Parke Davis goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.414" offset="9392985">He was advertising for the purpose of enticing into his store customers who came to get a bargain on Parke Davis and then he switched them to his own brands for his own purposes and that the Court found was one of the purposes of this price cutting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.385" offset="9484936">He was using our goods and our name as scenery to get people, as one of the witnesses said, to get people into his store so that his salesman who got a commission for selling his goods and didn't get any commission for selling Parke Davis goods could push his own goods on which he had a larger margin of profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.855" offset="9566751">He was also demoralizing the trade because he was cutting these prices to a point where he was offering the products below the price of which the ordinary everyday corner drug store could buy these products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.095" offset="9627773">And so, all of these retailer drugstores lost interest in trying to promote Parke Davis goods and that was the trade in the traffic on which Parke Davis depend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.058" offset="9687646">So, what happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.936" offset="9699140">Parke Davis representatives went to these various retailers, and there're five of them in this case and it said, “If you don't stop cutting prices, we will not sell to you” and these retailers said, “Well, in effect, we'll cut your papers” and they went right ahead cutting prices, and they cut prices throughout this entire period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.514" offset="9789419">They never stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.943" offset="9795166">They were never in a situation where they couldn't get goods because even though Parke Davis had gone to the wholesalers and said, “If you sell to price-cutting retailers, we will not sell to you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.841" offset="9850755">It is not clear that all of those wholesalers exceeded or accepted that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.465" offset="9873220">And in any event, the record is clear that the retailers continued to have the product and continued to sell it cut prices in the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.874" offset="9906866">So, then we come to this question or reinstatement and it is suggested that there are some kind of element of contract in reinstating a customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.843" offset="9954722">I don't understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.026" offset="9959528">I -- I don't see how that can be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.608" offset="9973844">I don't see how they can be any different element of agreement there than when you say to a man strictly within your Colgate rule, "I will not sell to you if you cut prices" and he goes ahead and does not cut prices that you sell to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.572" offset="10033612">There's just as much an element of agreement there, but what happened was that Parke Davis finding the price cutting continued, that it had been completely unsuccessful in eliminating any price cutting, went and suggested that they would continue to sell to these customers and that they would be free to charge any price they wanted in their store but they simply would not advertise in order to pull in these customers for other purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.979" offset="10155238">And for a period of about a month or six weeks, there were not cut price ads in the District of Columbia on Parke Davis goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.415" offset="10188988">At the end of about six weeks, that was the end of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.363" offset="10204871">An advertisement appeared on the paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.630" offset="10213857">Everybody else began to advertise and Parke Davis threw up its hand and said, “Well, that's all, we've had it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.476" offset="10245308">Just lots of -- as we suggest in the brief, supporting the position that Mr. Chaipy took in his article of this whole problem, famous article of this whole problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.987" offset="10283342">He said, "Nobody really can prevent price cutting and maintain prices if he strictly followed the requirements of the Colgate doctrine.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.779" offset="10322526">We never were able to prevent it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.385" offset="10328900">We never did and price cutting continued throughout this period and has continued ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.229" offset="10364322">Now, I don't know what process this Court is going to go through if it undertakes to reexamine this record to see whether these various challenged findings are correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.222" offset="10420224">The findings say that an agreement was not solicited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.058" offset="10439555">The findings say specifically as to each of these particular retailers and wholesalers that not agreement was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.150" offset="10479992">The trial judge stated not only that he followed the testimony, but that he'd read the daily transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.626" offset="10505906">We had elaborate arguments about these findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.183" offset="10516146">The government opposed our finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.091" offset="10523773">They submitted alternative findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.302" offset="10532551">They filed separate motion thereafter to set aside the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.339" offset="10544776">In all, I think we had two or three briefs in argument on this issue and the trial judge came to his conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.316" offset="10576645">If you go through this evidence and you undertake this task of retrying this case, I urge that you not be misled by selective bits of the testimony such as been offered to you on argument today because you will find by a reading of the entirety of the record that are totally different kind of a picture of what occurred pertained than those by -- if you select a particular item, here or there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2939.197" offset="11860198">Reference is made to the fact that we -- there was some discussion concerning what others were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.324" offset="11892694">Well, in -- on occasion when a salesman went and said, “If you -- if you don't -- if you don't observe our policy and you cut prices, we won't sell to you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.017" offset="11939401">The other fellow says, “What about the guy across the street?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.458" offset="11961240">Perfectly natural question to arise or a man says, you say to a man, "I will not sell to you if you cut prices," and he says, "I agree.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.872" offset="12010872">Is that an agreement within the Colgate doctrine?</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.949" offset="12023202">Or he says, "I'll abide by your wishes, alright I'll go along."</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.645" offset="12041906">These are just human discourse that has nothing to do with the question as to whether an agreement was sought, an agreement was solicited or an agreement in -- in any legal sense to coercion or otherwise, was obtained.</text>
