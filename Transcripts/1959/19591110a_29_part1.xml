            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="16.980" offset="171342">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.450" offset="185135">This declaratory judgment action is here on direct appeal from the Federal District Court for the Southern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.716" offset="218258">It comes to this Court on direct appeal under 28 U.S.C., United States Code 1252 which provides for a direct appeal in a civil proceeding involving the Government when a District Court has held invalid a statute of Congress, and the statute of Congress which the District Court here invalidated is Section 401 (j) of the Nationality Act of 1940, providing for loss of nationality by an American who has gone abroad to evade the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.513" offset="361409">Both the issue and the case have been here before.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.794" offset="374575">The case was here at the same time as the expatriation cases which were decided two terms ago and was remanded to the District Court in the light of one of those cases, then decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.231" offset="424312">The issue itself was involved as presented by the parties in the Perez case, but was not decided by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.291" offset="456495">The only issue in this case, as it comes to this Court, is the validity of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.392" offset="476975">There are no questions of fact involved, as I shall point out, they were stipulated below.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.119" offset="495888">So the only issue is the issue of the validity of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.187" offset="520129">As I shall also point out a little more in detail later, this particular section of the Nationality Act of 1944, though it was before the Court two terms ago, was not passed upon by the Court and therefore, the issue is now open for the Court to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.149" offset="592018">I should also mention at this point I think that this involves the Nationality Act of 1940 which has since of course been superseded by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 as a comparable provision in -- in the later Act, but it -- it contains somewhat different provisions and so I -- I'd want to say that what we have here is the Section 401 (j) of the Nationality Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.401" offset="696926">The facts were undisputed and were stipulated in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.749" offset="714376">The appellee was born in the United States in 1922 and of course was an American citizen at birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.622" offset="741857">He was also at birth and has at all time since been a citizen of the Republic of Mexico.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.578" offset="1265664">I'd like to point out at this moment, Mr. Justice Stewart that I don't think the issue of his age is in the case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.992" offset="1287293">First, that it wasn't raised and second, because the Section 401 (j) was only passed in September 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.250" offset="1316342">And the -- it was his remaining abroad after that time which constituted his expatriation and by that time he was 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.114" offset="1347793">So, in this case, in a previous case, there was that issue involved but in this case there is no such issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.471" offset="1377259">He -- as I was saying, the deportation proceeding was brought against him and an order of deportation was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.847" offset="1402755">Apparently, he then left voluntary to return to Mexico under that order of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.697" offset="1426160">Sometime in 1952, he returned to the United States, apparently claiming to be an American citizen and after his return in 1952, another deportation proceeding was brought against him in 1953 and he was again ordered deported and it was ordered -- the order of deportation was upheld by the Board of Immigration Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.997" offset="1503378">It was then that he brought the present declaratory judgment action, to have himself declared an American citizen and of course, if he prevails in that -- in this suit, the deportation order will necessarily be invalidated because he will not be an alien and therefore not subject to deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.889" offset="1578924">Two terms ago, the Court handed down two decisions in the Perez and Trop cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.689" offset="1606092">Before I begin to discuss Section 401 (j), I'd like, if I may, to give a summary of what in our view those two cases decided and what is the present background of the -- of existing law and expatriation as I stand here to argue this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.032" offset="1687489">The Perez case as the Court remembers involves Section 401 (e) of the 1940 Nationality Act, the foreign voting provision and the opinion of the Court which was very majority of the Court, we think decided the following propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.915" offset="1751019">We think, the Court, the majority of the Court decided, that Congress did have the power to denationalize American citizens in appropriate cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.365" offset="1792815">And it rejected the notion that such denationalization can only follow upon a voluntary renunciation by the citizen himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.863" offset="1830849">Second, we think the Court decided, in our view and in the Court's view affirming or conforming what had previously been decided in Mackenzie against Hare and in the Savorgnan case decided that in a subjective intent to give up ones nationality was not a prerequisite and therefore, was not required to validate denationalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.049" offset="1923532">And third, we think the Court decided that the general standard for determining the validity of an expatriation statute of Congress was the rational connection of the denationalization with a granted power of Congress and that case, as decided by the Court, it was the Foreign Affairs power and we think the Court recognized that due deference has to be given to the judgment of Congress at the same time that due deference is paid to the cherished status of American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.940" offset="2047143">Now, the Court also had before it, the second case, the Trop Case as to which there was no opinion for the majority of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.612" offset="2085804">As we read it, the Section 401 (g) was invalidated by a majority of the members of the Court as improper punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.409" offset="2128959">The four justices who joined in the Chief Justice's opinion, we think held that in the circumstances there where Trop, the petitioner in that case did not have a second citizenship, he was not a dual national that the consequence of statelessness which would be vested upon him by the denationalization provision of Congress constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.030" offset="2235538">As we read Justice Brennan's concurring opinion in substance, he -- he was of the view that the punishment of denationalization was too drastic a penalty for the objectives to be gained, sought to be gained by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="549.752" offset="2302412">Didn't -- didn't four justices in Trop expressed the view that Congress was without power to deprive anybody of a citizenship because the way citizenship is defined in the Fourteenth Amendment?</text>

            <text syncTime="575.970" offset="2407215">As we -- we read -- as we see the situation, Mr. Justice Stewart, was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.842" offset="2422784">Mr. Justice Whittaker who did not join in the decision of the Court in the Perez Case, the voting case, in his memorandum there, said that he did agree with the general principle that was adopted in the Perez Case than in appropriate cases, Congress did have the power to denationalize citizen -- citizens, regardless of his voluntary desire to be denationalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.641" offset="2513899">As I read the section of the Chief Justice's opinion in the Trop case, he is speaking for himself and the two colleagues who joined him in dissent and in Perez but not Mr. Justice Whittaker who had made his views on the general subject of plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.744" offset="2574399">So that I think that the law as I stand here today is the -- the Perez case, the decision of the Court in the Perez case and I think the Chief Justice if I may say so recognized in his opinion in the Trop case that that was so because he says the majority of the Court has taken another view and I will attempt to get -- I will give the reasons why in our view that section, Section 401 (g), the desertion section was invalid even under the view of the majority in -- in the Perez.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="652.312" offset="2712639">That I think that I may fairly be said is the one in which Justice Whittaker joined with the other three justices and Justice Brennan had of course his own opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.353" offset="2760808">The burden of my argument of course will be to try to show the Court that there are differences between 401 (g), the desertion section which was involved in the Trop case and 401 (j) the draft evasion section which I haven't in the case which is before Your Honors now.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.444" offset="2833115">They both have a common source.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.691" offset="2842102">It is true that both of these provisions find their common progenitor in the 1865 statute of the Civil War Congress which provided for loss of the rights of citizenship by deserters and those who went beyond the district having enrolled in the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.233" offset="2924335">We have always maintained and for the benefit of the members of the Court who were not, Mr. Justice Stewart, who was not a member of the Court at the time of the Perez case, in the appendix to our brief, we have set forth the parts of our briefs in the Perez and Trop cases in which we tried to show that the 1865 statute was a true loss of nationality Statute and not merely a forfeiture of franchise right.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.308" offset="3028616">I don't know if that's too decisive, but I thought that -- we have maintained that we think that this is supported by the Congressional treatment of the statute by the administrative treatment and by certain Court decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.718" offset="3078248">But the -- the factors in which the 1865 statute is different from the later statute, both the desertion statute which is before the Court in Trop and the draft evasion statute which is before the Court in the present time are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.484" offset="3149302">Under the 1865 statute, a court-martial conviction was required, that is the statute as interpreted by the Court required a court-martial conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.714" offset="3186186">And second, it was not necessary to leave the country in order to have invoked the provisions of the 1865 statute either as to desertion or as to draft evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.233" offset="3232266">The provision that's draft evasion in the 1865 statute merely provided for loss of the rights of citizenship if you left the district where you were enrolled, not if you left the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.770" offset="3274480">And, I shall try to point out to the Court that in our view, the leaving of the country is a very decisive factor and a very different factor from what was the Congress had in the earlier statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.126" offset="3323904">Well, this 1865 statute continues in effect, in 1912 it was modified to apply -- to apply -- only to peace time desertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.521" offset="3361416">Of course since there was no draft after the civil war.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.158" offset="3376044">There was no effectiveness of the draft evasion provision until World War II and it was considered to be in effect in World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.329" offset="3408645">It was repealed in 1940 when Congress passed the General Nationality Act and recodified the whole matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.539" offset="3437484">As far as I can determine, there is no reference anywhere to why it was repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.975" offset="3459323">I think the true answer probably is that the draft evasion at that -- when the Cabinet Committee and the Congressional Committees were considering the problem of loss of nationality for the new code, there was no Draft Act in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.247" offset="3520345">It only went in to effect in October 1940 and so, they didn't think it necessary to continue the draft evasion part of the earlier statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.025" offset="3555453">They did continue the desertion provision in Section 401 (g) which is here in Trop.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.715" offset="3578232">But Congress did come along as the Court remembers very quickly in the Spring -- in the Fall of 1940 and passed a new Selective Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.106" offset="3611773">And I think though that Act was in a sense going through Congress simultaneously, it was too new and too quick a change to make anybody think of making a change in the draft evasion provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="909.475" offset="3741236">The Attorney General made the suggestion in 1944 and it was unanimously recommended by the appropriate committees of both houses and passed by both houses with very short debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.651" offset="3789928">It was made very clear in the legislative history at that time that they were to be in a sense these two differences from the earlier Civil War Statute that is no criminal or court martial conviction was to be required for draft evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.632" offset="3853876">Congress thought that there would be many people who would never return to the country and therefore there would be no possibility of having a criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.444" offset="3881148">It was made quite clear on the floor of the House and at least that they didn't want these people whom they felt had lost the right to be American citizens to come back to the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.261" offset="3920436">But they did want them to have the right of Court review and so they provided for a Court review under Section 503 of the Nationality Act which is the general provision of that statute providing for a Court review of a claim of American citizenship in which there is de novo determination of the facts by the District Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.487" offset="6321298">When he goes abroad to another country, to Mexico as in this case, there is involved another country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.848" offset="6342719">The United States which is the country of his nationality has double interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.701" offset="6358183">It has an interest in seeing that he returns if possible to serve his -- his Country in the Armed Forces as is required to do and it also has another we think interest that is it has an interest in saying that a particular country nearby whether it will be Mexico or some other country does not become a center of refuge or disaffection for a large number of draft evaders that we think is a -- a responsible interest which the United States can have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.775" offset="6470510">Now, since the draft evader is in another country, the United States can call upon the other Country to deliver him up and say, we want you Mexico or what other country to send Mr. Mendoza-Martinez back to this Country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.916" offset="6539055">And that is a possibility of embroilment there or the United States can get in touch with the draft evader individually, questionably and say we want you to return back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.114" offset="6579806">Now, he may then turn to the country where he is because the country where he is a country of his present residence and he can call upon them at least for a certain measure of protection and he can turn to Mexico and say, I don't want to go back to the United States, you help me to stay here I don't want to go back and serve in the army.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.411" offset="6669040">I shall try to point out later that of course all these possibilities are heightened when he is a national of the country of – of play as he was in this case, but I'm speaking now of a situation where he is not a national of the country at play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.476" offset="6717315">He is just an alien resident in Mexico and I'm trying to point out the possibilities of international embroilment which can occur just from this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.200" offset="6772172">The 19th Century history of the relationship of the United States with Great Britain and France and Germany and Austria does show the difficulties that can arise when a country which has conscription as Great Britain, France, Austria and Germany did in the 19th Century and wants to enforce conscription, the difficulties that can arise when that country reaches over to another country and says, “You have a national of our country living in your territory, we want him back.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.895" offset="6874990">The pages of Morris Digest of -- in national law and other books are filled with -- with diplomatic negotiations between this country and other countries with respect to claim of the foreign countries to have their citizens or people they regarded as their citizens, return to that country for the purpose of observing in the armies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.675" offset="6966105">Now, this possibility can arise in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.216" offset="6984286">It is certainly not beyond possibility that certain countries here and near this United States or faraway could become centers of draft evasion or disaffection and it -- in a situation it might become very important for the United States to be able to secure as large an amount of manpower as possible for the army and it would in a situation like that make a request to these countries saying, don't -- don't accept Americans who come to your country for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.539" offset="7105494">Send them back or refuse them at the borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.369" offset="7128900">Our opponents say, well, the United States of course isn't required to make a request to the other country, it isn't required to create an international embroilment but of course you don't judge these issues and you don't test them by whether it's the other country which first raises the issue or whether it is we who raised the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.765" offset="7210402">Extradition matters are matters of foreign affairs, but we are always the one who is asking the other country to send back, when we're asking to extradite somebody, send back the alleged criminal from the other country or when an American is mistreated abroad, it's this country which raises with the other country the issue of the American being mistreated abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.124" offset="7287829">So, I don't think that there's any substance in the argument that the United States, even though its thought that another country was becoming too large a center of -- too large a refuge or sanctuary for draft evaders should, shall we say forestall any international complications by refusing to -- to draw the matter to the attention of the other country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.977" offset="7379257">It is in the realm of foreign of affairs and it's a matter which the United States can appropriately take up with the other country as the whole history of the 19th Century indicates.</text>

            <text syncTime="2121.719" offset="8590294">But I think it has a -- a bearing in two respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.831" offset="8602728">One is that the history is very clear and the actual history under the statute is clear that it has -- it's had its major impact on dual nationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.527" offset="8633448">Every case that we have found where anyone has been expatriated appears to have been a dual national probably of Mexico and the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2139.204" offset="8660198">If that's so, you put it the other way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.565" offset="8669602">The existence of dual national as potential people who rid themselves with obligations to this country might well have been inducing cause of the legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2151.248" offset="8708368">-- Justice Frankfurter that it was an inducing cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.819" offset="8718608">This becomes clear from the -- from the letters which the Attorney general sent to the Senate Committees as well as from the debates that there -- it was clear that they were talking mostly about people who went to Mexico and there was a specific reference to the fact that these -- these were Mexican nationals too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.838" offset="8778689">So, I rest on both grounds, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.627" offset="8789870">If necessary, I would also rest of course on a ground of separability that the case before the Court involves a dual national and that Separability Clause of the 1940 Act would separate out any other non-valid application of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.079" offset="8859669">We think also that -- that -- on -- on this matter of flight abroad that it does, particularly where the individual is a dual national, it does show in -- in reference to what the Court said in the Perez case about a choice of allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.143" offset="8931976">That it does show a choice on the part of this man for the protection of Mexico, his other nationality rather than the responsibilities of -- or the obligations of his American citizenship.</text>
