            <text syncTime="169.795" offset="782503">Well, the designation premium beers is attributable to the fact that in almost every market in the United States, these national beers are sold at a premium price, at a higher price than the regional or local beers.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="199.214" offset="900263">Well, I think those illusions are -- are very real in the sense that they affect the economics of this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.195" offset="948120">As the Commission found, the reason that these national beers, these premium beers are able to sell at a profit, in large volume, in almost every market in the country at this higher price, is that they are well established beers.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.974" offset="1047280">Their characteristics are well-known.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.641" offset="1057938">They enjoy excellent reputations.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.901" offset="1074970">And for that reason, most if not, the overwhelming majority of consumers of beer are willing to pay a few cents more per bottle or can for these beers.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.370" offset="1132857">To put it concretely if -- if in the Washington area, if I may speak on the basis of what -- what I think is within judicial notice, I think, if -- if I walk into a liquor store, if I see that the price of Budweiser beer per case is about the same as the price of Valley Forge or National Bohemian, I mentioned them only because they're local beers in this area and I don't mean in any sense to -- to depreciate their quality, I would assume that most people, if they can get Budweiser at the same price as these other regional or local beers, will choose Budweiser.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.195" offset="1292204">By the same token, if that price spread is eliminated or put it another way, if the price spread is too high, if you have to pay too much for a Budweiser or Schlitz or Pabst, the consumer may bulk at that point so that there's a very, very close relationship, competitively, in the industry which is affected by the illusion to which Mr. Justice Frankfurter has referred as there's a sensitivity of consumer reaction which is affected not only by the superior premium characteristics of the -- of the beer but also by the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.885" offset="1502960">Now, the price of these beers is not uniform throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.696" offset="1526157">It varies depending upon local market factory such as differences in the cost, the distribution, differences in the cost of -- resulting from local taxation, regulation and so on, so that there isn't a uniform or a constant price for the beers throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.174" offset="1620093">But as the Commission found, there is this price differential which exists in almost every market of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.158" offset="1672025">The -- the national beers are in almost every area of the United States sold at some higher price.</text>

            <text syncTime="416.149" offset="1767946">No, I don't think that you can generalize with any degree of competencies but I think there's -- there's a great degree of flexibility and fluctuation in -- in as to the price of beers that the only thing that seems to be relatively constant in the pricing structure is the existence of this price differential between the national beers and the regional and local beers.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.877" offset="1874840">And as the Commission found, if that differential is eliminated, it very seriously and adversely affects the ability of the regional beers to compete with the national because the consumer if he -- if he is not influenced by this price consideration, will tend in the direction of the well-known national products.</text>

            <text syncTime="543.687" offset="2278170">Now, this case involves certain price reductions which the respondent Budweiser, Anheuser -- Anheuser-Busch manufacturer of Budweiser, made in the St. Louis area, in 1954, which had the effect of wiping out this price differential between its beer and the -- and the regionals.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.082" offset="2371688">Now there are -- there were three regional beers in St. Louis which were respondents, principal competitors, Falstaff, Griesedieck Brothers and Griesedieck Western throughout the record, these latter two brewers are referred to by their initials simply as GB and GW and I think perhaps that there's --- it's be well to follow that example.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.969" offset="2511287">Now, these three regional beers were sold competitively against with -- with Budweiser, against Budweiser not only in the St. Louis market but in almost half of the United States, if not more.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.157" offset="2591953">Falstaff competed against Budweiser in 26 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.809" offset="2614627">GB competed against Budweiser in 13 States and GW competed with Budweiser in 20 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.084" offset="2655692">And some of the 13 and 20 States were not included in the 26 States in which Falstaff was sold so that in a very large area of the country, Budweiser was competing against these three beers.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.048" offset="2719535">Now, in St. Louis, in December of 1953, Budweiser was selling at $2.93 a case.</text>

            <text syncTime="688.749" offset="2858402">Now, despite the fact that Budweiser was selling at -- at a higher price in St. Louis, as the Commission found, it was doing quite well in St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.465" offset="2925275">Sales in that market were on the ascendancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.289" offset="2940531">It was slowly but steadily increasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.863" offset="2954846">And during the period between the end of World War II, in December of 1953, the sales of Budweiser in the St. Louis market had more than doubled.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.756" offset="3014405">In 1953, this is all by way of background, there had been a long, bitterly contested strike in the beer industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.530" offset="3069471">That strike was settled in August of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.072" offset="3083682">And as a result, the labor cost in the beer industry generally had increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.607" offset="3121821">Consequently, on October 1, 1953, all of the national brewers raised their prices of beer, generally, throughout the country except for two states, Missouri, where St. Louis is located and Wisconsin, where Milwaukee is located and I don't know whether there's any significance to that fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="970.849" offset="3986787">We're in St. Louis where -- where incidentally but the price of Budweiser was the lowest in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.142" offset="4015940">The price that -- the price at which respondent was selling Budweiser in St. Louis in December 1953 before all these occurred was $2.93.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.520" offset="4053452">The lowest price that it was charging in the country, the high was Los Angeles, $3.80.</text>

            <text syncTime="997.066" offset="4091591">But St. Louis was the lowest price in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.924" offset="4107055">Now, it is also, perhaps the significance the Commission thought it was, that as a result of the increase in price which Budweiser and the other nationals had made in October of 1953, Budweiser's sales dropped off drastically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.106" offset="4215829">Again illustrating the sensitivity of consumer reaction to price when they raised the prices of beer, sales fell off substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.945" offset="4259192">In December of 1953, Budweiser' sales nationally were 30% below the preceding year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.429" offset="4289076">This was of course in sharp contrast to the situation in St. Louis where Budweiser was -- was doing very well, where its sales were going up, where there had been no increase in price as a result of this strike settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.817" offset="4354591">Now, despite the fact that the price of Budweiser in St. Louis was the lowest in the country, despite the fact that Budweiser's sales were -- were on the increase in St. Louis, despite the fact that that was the one area in the country where the company was making money and not losing money, the respondent reduced its prices in the St. Louis area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.187" offset="4448110">First as I say on January 4 in the amount of 25 cents and then on June 4, they wiped out the differential entirely bringing their price down to $2.35, exactly matching the price of the three regionals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.686" offset="4526164">Now, the -- the trial examiner found and his findings were adopted by the Commission, that it was after the June 24, 1954 price reduction by AB, the respondent, that the roof really fell in on the St. Louis market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.459" offset="4601187">He says -- and I'm reading now from his findings in the record page at 31, “I have rarely seen such a dramatic exhibition of economic power and price sensitivity in so short of time."</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.285" offset="4656462">Apparently, the beer -- beer consuming populous in the St. Louis market equates premium quality with premium price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.654" offset="4690004">The tremendous switch from other beers to Budweiser when the premium price was eliminated cannot, on this record, be otherwise accounted for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.378" offset="4724903">Apparently, also, it is the first 30 cents or less of -- of premium or differential in price which touches off the reaction in the St. Louis market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.052" offset="4763564">He then gives the -- the statistical data as to the actual effect on sales during this period in 1954 and Budweiser sales, for example, tripled during this short period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.333" offset="4848724">The -- there's -- in -- in May of 1954 they -- their -- their share of -- of the total was 15.5%, the next month 22.6%, in July, 37.6%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.294" offset="4904521">It was spectacular the way that the -- the few cents made the difference in -- in the competitive situation and in the effect in sales.</text>

            <text syncTime="1311.977" offset="5351320">Before the Commission, there was no disagreement that there was a difference in price between Budweiser beer in St. Louis and price charged in other markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.069" offset="5395623">There was no controversy that there was a higher price charged to purchasers and other markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.103" offset="5423835">There was no inquiry made as to what the effects of the lowering of price in St. Louis may have been on the customers of respondent in the other markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.762" offset="5478379">The issues that were framed by the Commission's complaint and the respondent's answer were these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.754" offset="5506382">Was there really an injury to competition as a result of these price reductions?</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.254" offset="5532400">Was there a cause of relationship between the reductions in the injuries?</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.780" offset="5550477">The respondent argued that these -- its competitors suffered these losses not because of the price reductions but because in the case of one of them, its product was inferior in the case of the other, poor business management.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.004" offset="5611395">There was an issue tendered as to the meeting of competition, in meeting of -- of the lower price in good faith in Section 2 (b) defense and as to all these issues to resolve against the respondent by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.162" offset="5680044">The main factual line of defense was that in St. Louis, the respondent was conducting a price experiment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.545" offset="5725602">They were faced with a bad situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1424.931" offset="5803133">In March, 1955, Budweiser raised its price from $2.35 to -- to $2.65, I believe.</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.636" offset="6021935">It proved that they could -- they could solve their -- their problem by lowering their prices because when they lowered their prices in St. Louis, they really starting to sell.</text>

            <text syncTime="1496.511" offset="6089435">At one point after another, the hearing examiner never got a satisfactory answer of this one question, why he asked them if we were -- if we were troubled about your -- your national picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.207" offset="6140217">Your sale is going down nationally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.075" offset="6151711">Why -- if you -- if your sales went down after you raised your prices in October 1953 elsewhere but in St. Louis, why did you pick St. Louis to conduct this price experiment of reducing your prices where -- when your prices in St. Louis where the lowest in the country and when you had no -- no problem of -- of -- there because you were doing very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.164" offset="6252022">And he didn't get any satisfactory answer to that question until the testimony of the respondent's president came at the very close of the hearing, after all the evidence was in, after all the marketing surveys and the testimony of sales, managers and so on was in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.527" offset="6329448">The very last witness in the case was called by the Commission as a rebuttal witness and that was Mr. August A. Busch Jr., President of Anheuser-Busch.</text>

            <text syncTime="1593.398" offset="6476988">This is -- I'm -- I'm now reading from Volume 2, page 934 and Mr. Busch as I understand as a Commission witness, he's being examined by Mr. Mayer, counsel for the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.512" offset="6549400">And page 934, in the middle of the page, Mr. Mayer says, “The national shippers increased their prices after the settlement of the brewer strike in Milwaukee in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.484" offset="6601331">Did they not answer in October 1953?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.091" offset="6615751">Now was that generally true of all the brewers throughout the country?</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.905" offset="6638947">For the first time I think in the history of the brewing industry, when the large shipping brewers increased their price for the first time, as I recall it in the brewing industry, the regionals and locals in some areas did not increase their price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.827" offset="6698715">Question, “Did not increase their price?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.474" offset="6705298">That is correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.365" offset="6772799">Then on page 935, the interrogation continues, Mr. -- Mr. Busch says he doesn't see any connection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.544" offset="6817520">He still can't see any connection between the regionals not raising their prices and respondents reducing its price in St. Louis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1988.451" offset="8057187">I think you're raising a -- a very serious question as to the scope of the meeting competition -- meeting the lower price of the competitor in good faith defense which is one of the defenses here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.141" offset="8103894">It was -- it's -- it's -- it was not reached by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.393" offset="8116955">I think that questions of that sort ought not to be considered by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.725" offset="8142242">They weren't decided by the Court of Appeals or reached by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.665" offset="8154049">But let me say this by way of an answering the context of -- of Your Honors' review of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.654" offset="8186023">You have here a difference of price between the St. Louis market and the other markets of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.611" offset="8233775">There's no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.207" offset="8244224">And the -- the argument which was made in the Court of Appeals by the respondent, not in its petition for review, didn't raise this question in its -- in presenting the appeal for the Court of Appeals, but on its reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.766" offset="8314441">For the first time in this case, the argument was made that it is essential prerequisite for a violation of Section 2 of the Clayton Act which speaks of discriminations in price that there'd be a discrimination and you cannot discriminate between two people unless the effect is to help one and hurt the other and that in this case, Budweiser wasn't discriminating among its competitors in St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.726" offset="8466265">It was treating them all alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.362" offset="8472848">The price reductions that it made in St. Louis were uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.835" offset="8486745">It wasn't discriminating among its customers in St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.537" offset="8505553">They all paid the same price so the Court of Appeals said, “So far as St. Louis is concerned, there's no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.191" offset="8532093">If there is any discrimination, it has to be against the -- the purchasers of respondent and these other markets of the country.” But says the Court of Appeals, “these customers in other markets aren't competing with the -- the retailers of Budweiser in St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.013" offset="8611401">There's no competitive relationship between them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.996" offset="8623313">Now, if there's no competitive relationship between them, they aren't heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.292" offset="8640554">And if they aren't heard, by definition, the essence of discrimination is that somebody is -- is benefitted and somebody else is injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.730" offset="8682245">There's no injury to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.864" offset="8686843">Therefore, there's -- there's no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.469" offset="8697292">The Court of Appeals says that there has to be some relationship between the people allegedly discriminated against, entitling them to the same prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.545" offset="8741595">And if there's no relationship here, between respondent's purchasers in St. Louis and its purchasers in other areas and that we -- we can see that they're not in -- there's no competition between the people, the retailers who buy from respondent in Los Angeles or (Inaudible) -- and -- and those at -- retailers in St. Louis there's no -- certainly not that relation and there's nothing in this record that -- that indicates that Budweiser passed on any losses it may have suffered in St. Louis to its purchasers in other markets in the form of a higher price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.011" offset="8907421">As a matter of fact, the record indicates that they did very well in St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.375" offset="8924871">They were operating profitably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.049" offset="8931558">There weren't any losses, so far as we know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.876" offset="8942843">We certainly -- the -- the Commission didn't attempt to present any evidence of that sort and the respondent made no effort to raise any issue as to whether there was any injury to competition other -- outside the St. Louis area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.682" offset="9010134">In other words, no issue was tendered before the Commission based upon the contention that in order to have a discrimination between purchasers in different markets, not only did you have to show injury to competition in the market in which the price cut is made to the competitors of the seller, but that you also had to show that there was some injury to competition in other markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.213" offset="9144195">That issue was not raised in -- and nevertheless, it was the basis upon which the Court of Appeals ruled as a matter of statutory interpretation that the words “discrimination and price” require that as an essential condition defining a violation of Section 2 of the Clayton Act that there'd be adverse economic effects upon the purchasers and other markets who pay the higher price.</text>

            <text syncTime="2342.595" offset="9473755">The Court of Appeals thought that the facts of this case really fell within Section 3, the criminal provision of -- of Robinson-Patman which makes it a crime to charge a lower price for the purpose of destroying or eliminating a competitor so that on the view of the facts, which the Court of Appeals assumed for purposes of its decision, the price reductions in St. Louis may be assumed to be predatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.154" offset="9603950">They may be assumed to be for the purpose of destroying respondent's competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.416" offset="9625057">They may be assumed to be a -- as bad as you like, but under the view of the statute, which the Court of Appeals adopted, doesn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.044" offset="9659538">What happens in St. Louis is you can't show some injury to the respondent's customers in other markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.454" offset="9701230">There's no discrimination because the discrimination is between purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.472" offset="9717217">Now, our brief elaborates in some detail the various reasons which -- which, we think, could make it abundantly clear that the Court of Appeals adopted a most unreal artificial construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.391" offset="9792972">The statute it -- itself defines what makes a price difference and illegal discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.538" offset="9825573">The -- this isn't -- we're not dealing here with discrimination in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.416" offset="9841037">The discrimination is, of course, a -- a differentiation of treatment which when judged by a controlling standard it -- it is as unjustified and that we don't have to speculate in the abstract as to what the standard for determining when a price difference is an illegal prohibition under Section 2 because Section 2 which we have set forth in full in our -- the appendix to our reply brief on pages 14 and 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.352" offset="9980740">Section 2 defines its own standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.650" offset="10001951">It's a -- that the -- the entire section is -- is contained in a single sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.923" offset="10027029">It starts at the top of page 14 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.576" offset="10037687">It goes all the way down to the middle of page 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.036" offset="10047509">The Court is very familiar with Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.100" offset="10055764">It's had it in many cases and Your Honors know that in this one single sentence, Congress packed the four provisos, three or four conditions, semicolons, colons, and -- and you cannot do what the Court of Appeals did here, pick out one word, “discriminate” and disregard the rest of the sentence and speculate as to what Congress meant by “discriminate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.730" offset="10166314">The statute said that the discrimination is really a different -- a difference in price really is a discrimination and illegal where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, any line of commerce or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants, that's the seller, who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination or with customers of either of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.289" offset="10296508">So that under the statute, there's no question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.896" offset="10306957">The respondent doesn't deny it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.786" offset="10314480">That an injury to the competition of the seller who charges the lower price is -- is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.774" offset="10354500">Now, the -- it's clear as the -- as Your Honors know that the -- the whole purpose of -- of the original Section 2 of the Clayton Act in 1914 was to protect the -- the competitors of -- of sellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.228" offset="10416253">The legislative history and the cases under Section 2 of the 1914 Act showed that what Congress was trying to protect were the -- whether -- whether the -- the businessmen in -- in one area who were faced with -- with a -- a giant national corporation coming into that area and lowering its price to the point where the -- where the local people just can't -- can't compete.</text>

            <text syncTime="3379.521" offset="13621478">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.003" offset="13631404">It is certain, Alice in Wonderland about this argument.In the Commission proceeding, there was no finding by the Commission that Anheuser-Busch engaged in any punishment of competitors in St. Louis when it made this price reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.980" offset="13715310">Now, the facts of this case are that in January of 1954, in response to the urgent competitive conditions which have been alluded to losses of as much as 60% and 80% of sales in various States throughout the midwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.484" offset="13777272">Anheuser-Busch did reduce its price in St. Louis by this specified amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.963" offset="13799215">It didn't bring the prices down to the competitor's prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.826" offset="13814680">They were still 33 cents above.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.397" offset="13824920">And despite the fact that it reduced its prices in St. Louis in January to get a little closer to the competitor's prices, the sales results were minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.277" offset="13860446">Nothing happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.999" offset="13863372">Sales didn't increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.083" offset="13871731">In July -- in June of 1954, it did reduce its price to equal the competitor's price in St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.022" offset="13903496">In other words, they all sold for $2.35 to the retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.320" offset="13920632">Now, before the examiner, when Mr. Busch was called to testify, they missed -- the examiner misunderstood the facts of the case.He thought that AB had raised its price in St. Louis when it raised outside of St. Louis in October of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.535" offset="14001507">And he thought that the reason for the reduction of price by Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis was because Falstaff and the others had not raised their price in St. Louis when AB raised its price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.047" offset="14059604">Now, we outlined in fully, on our brief on pages 45 through 47 the facts regarding -- what I regard as the -- this crucial question in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.729" offset="14110281">If we were guilty of punishing competitors by our price reduction, we don't believe the Court of Appeals would have held that we did not discriminate in price when we lowered prices in St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.888" offset="14170885">This issue was fully talked out before the Court of Appeals half, a good part of the argument was devoted to it and the Court of Appeals obviously held that we did not have this purpose when we lowered prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.335" offset="14228668">Now, I would point out further that even though the examiner states what he states in his -- his proposed findings, it is significant that the Commission made no mention of this whatsoever in his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.649" offset="14290004">Now, what in fact happened was that when we got before the Commission, we pointed out that the examiner had been in error with respect to his facts in our briefs to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.217" offset="14344234">And Commission counsel on argument before the Commission, conceded that the examiner had been an error with respect to his facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.725" offset="14378297">Namely, we did not raise prices in St. Louis in October 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.813" offset="14402644">As a consequence, the Commission made no statement regarding this all important punishment issue in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.058" offset="14431587">And I would point out to you that it was vital that they do so because one of the issues before the Commission was that we were lowering our prices in good faith to meet competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.001" offset="14483414">Now, it may be that the Commission wouldn't agree that this punishment issue is important with regard to the discrimination issue as a legal matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.938" offset="14519150">But they could not fail to see that it would be a vital importance with respect to the meeting competition issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.044" offset="14547571">And there is not one word in the Commission opinion relating to the punishment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.041" offset="14571499">Now, I submit, Your Honors, under these circumstances that this case cannot be -- should not be considered by you on the basis that there was proof and found here a punishment purpose in lowering the prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="3675.747" offset="14806392">Now, Your Honor, it is perfectly clear from the argument before the Commission that the examiner was in error on this vital fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.044" offset="14847561">The Commission -- one of the Commissioners asked the question on the oral argument of Commission counsel, “didn't Anheuser-Busch raise its prices in St. Louis in October 1953?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.252" offset="14892387">And the counsel quite correctly said it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.353" offset="14908792">Now, I -- this sentence is somewhat grammatically dubious because the -- as modified, grammatically refers to all that goes before, but in any event I submit that in the absence of comment on this important issue in the Commission opinion, this sentence in the order which is of doubtful grammar should not be taken as an adoption of the issue by the Commission.</text>
