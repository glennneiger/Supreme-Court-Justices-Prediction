            <text syncTime="13.477" offset="157236">-- may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.117" offset="167790">We have here another action of habeas corpus testing the authority or seeking to test the authority of the military to try a civilian by military court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.896" offset="226931">The specific question involved here is whether the Constitution permits the trial of civilian employee of the army by military court-martial in France for a capital offense in time of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.372" offset="308851">The judicial history of this case began in December 1952 when Grisham was charged with the -- he was then a citizen of the United States and as I say a civilian employee and an accountant of the army, serving with the armed forces in France with a GS-9 civil service rating.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.219" offset="404250">When he was charged with the capital offense of premeditated murder under Article 118 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, he was tried by a military court-martial, a general court-martial convened in Orleans, France.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.696" offset="466108">He was convicted of the lesser included offense of unpremeditated murder, was sentenced to 35 or to life imprisonment and hard labor, which was subsequently reduced to 35 years by executive clemency.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.053" offset="535594">Grisham has exhausted all of his administrative remedies under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.096" offset="575718">He -- then, on October 26th, 1957 while serving his sentence at the United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court with another district alleging that his confinement was in violation of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.716" offset="674252">This case was heard before Honorable Frederick B. 0Bone and was argued and on April 22nd, 1958, the District Court filed an opinion dismissing the petition for writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.067" offset="739662">An appeal was immediately taken to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia, which was argued before the Third Circuit on October 24, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.005" offset="791385">On November 20, an opinion was filed by the Court of Appeals affirming the judgment of the District Court, opinion by Judge Goodrich.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.892" offset="842898">A petition for writ of certiorari followed which is the question now before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="190.911" offset="867035">Is your jurisdictional question here any different at all from Reid versus Covert except in that case the defendant was -- the defendant in this case is civilian employee?</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_wolfe_kalp" startTime="204.935" stopTime="454.189">
            <label>Mr. Charles Wolfe Kalp</label>
            <text syncTime="204.935" offset="923146">Our contention is that there is absolutely no other distinction factually.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.552" offset="945612">The cases are identical with the exception of that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.404" offset="960972">Now, the facts of this case are that the petitioner had been employed as a cost accountant, a civil service employee of the army engineers at Nashville, Tennessee continuously since 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.528" offset="1033488">Except for some time, some leave which he had during the Second World War going to the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.467" offset="1061282">In September 1952, he was temporarily assigned by the District Engineers at Nashville to duty with the District Engineers at Orleans, France.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.848" offset="1118751">Now, while employed by the Nashville office of the District Engineers, his work consisted primarily of multiple purpose setting up cost accounting systems in connection with multiple purpose dams and river and harbor improvements, civil works.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.054" offset="1199626">When he was assigned to the Orleans office in France with the District Engineers, he was given a job of setting up a cost accounting system for communications line between Germany and France.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.061" offset="1263574">He arrived in France on October 1st, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.016" offset="1283427">His wife arrived about November 30th, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.515" offset="1301400">And he and his wife were living in the City of Orleans in an apartment rented from a French civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.958" offset="1331179">They were not living on the military base.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.562" offset="1349569">On the night of December 6th, the petitioner and his wife attended a cocktail party given by an officer at the base and both of them had a considerable amount of drink.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.873" offset="1402859">Early in the morning of December 7th, the next morning of 1952, the petitioner notified both the French civilian authorities and the United States military authorities that his wife was dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.464" offset="1485197">He was subsequently questioned by the French military authorities who arrested him for murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.906" offset="1511006">He was held by the French military authorities under that charge from December 7th until December 23rd, 1952 at which time, he was released to the United States military authorities upon request under the status of forces treaty then in effect in France.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.924" offset="1607032">There is nothing in the record to show outside of the fact that he was working on a communications cost accounting system for communications line between Germany and France.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.641" offset="1649977">There is nothing in the record to show that the work he was doing was essential or necessary to any purely military function of the European Army headquarters in France.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.692" offset="1714134">The -- while in France, the petitioner was on the payroll of the Nashville Office of the District Engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.695" offset="1746108">He was paid from civil works funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.259" offset="1756453">He furnished his own housing, food, medical care and transportation both for himself and his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.285" offset="1788531">Now, prior to entering a plea to the general issue in the court-martial proceeding, the petitioner challenged the jurisdiction of the Court both as to his person and as to the offense charged on the ground that jurisdiction of both this person and the offense remained with the French and now, after six years of confinement in the penitentiary, that is still this petitioner's contention.</text>

            <text syncTime="498.691" offset="2098134">It was approved, however, but he of course didn't bring a petition for writ of habeas corpus until the second Covert decision was handed down by this Court and then I talked to him at the penitentiary and he did file his petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.466" offset="2161246">Now, the petition was actually filed October 26th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.875" offset="2202833">And the opinion was filed by the District Court on April 22nd, 1958, the opinion, it was argued in the Court of Appeals, October 24, 1958 and the opinion was handed down by the Court of Appeals on November 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.357" offset="2264795">So, as far as the judicial procedure since the petition for writ of habeas corpus was filed, it has been fairly prompt.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.401" offset="2316936">Now, both in the Court, the District Court and in the Court of Appeals, we have argued that this case cannot be distinguished from the -- this Court's decision in the Covert case, the second decision on any supportable or substantial basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.340" offset="2408782">In the -- the Government's argument, this is supported, I should say, by the Government's argument in the Guagliardo case and also their argument in the supplementary brief which they filed in the second Covert case in which they -- they specifically stated that they were not urging -- they did not feel that any valid distinction could be made between civilian dependents and civilian employees serving with the armed forces or accompanying the armed forces overseas.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Wolfe Kalp</label>
            <text syncTime="620.222" offset="2584221">That's very true.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.626" offset="2601880">I think that under the concurring opinions of Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Frankfurter that it's particularly difficult to distinguish this case from those -- the reasoning of those opinions because, if we're going to balance the necessity and propriety of court-martial jurisdiction against the desirability of protecting these persons under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments and giving them Article III trials, it seems to me the fact that this petitioner was charged with a capital offense where the issue actually was one of life or death should have considerable weight in weighing the scales in his favor if there should be any balancing of interest in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.233" offset="2832280">So far as the decision of Mr. Justice or the reasoning of Mr. Justice Black's opinion, it doesn't seem to me that it makes any difference whether it's a capital offense or a non-capital offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.602" offset="2881808">And I don't know if there is any fact here on which these decisions can be distinguished by Mr. Covert decision and the second Covert decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.882" offset="2934888">However, the lower courts did distinguish them and the Court of Appeals gave three specific -- or gave four grounds upon which the distinction was allegedly based.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.250" offset="2984417">One, that long established history, tradition and practice gave the military authority to court-martial civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.940" offset="3035094">I assume in time of peace as this was.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.696" offset="3050141">Now, I'm not going to go into the historical background.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.300" offset="3064560">I don't have the background material to do what Colonel Wiener has I think done an excellent and thorough job in that connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.057" offset="3111581">I do want to make this one observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.573" offset="3121716">However, it seems to me that if the framers of the United States Constitution had ever thought that Clause 14 was to be used to extend authority to the military to court-martial a civilian for a capital offense in peacetime in a friendly foreign country that there certainly would've been quite an argument at the convention and we would find some reference to that situation in the various source materials which must be studied in order to understand the Constitution and as far as I know, there are none.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.562" offset="3305618">And I sincerely feel that there just is not any well-established practice permitting the trial of civilians in peacetime by military court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.985" offset="3375313">Now, of course there is -- as has been discussed here the one exception which is based on the war powers, in time of war and in the field in the face of actual hostile, the military operations there certainly is power to court-martial civilians under the laws of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.780" offset="3462457">At least, that is traditional, but here, there is no such tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.752" offset="3490356">Secondly, Judge Goodrich stressed the fact of necessity.</text>

            <text syncTime="868.757" offset="3578441">Well, of course the Article 2 (11) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice purports to give that authority to if it's constitutionally does give that authority to the military in time of war and peace I assume, but that's the question at issue here as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.770" offset="3666422">It seems to me that in essence, the Government is arguing in these cases that this war power, this right to try civilians in the field in the face of actual hostile of military operations which has some historical authenticity and background that that should be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.445" offset="3757119">In other words, the concept within the field should be extended here to cover peacetime cases where there is actually no fighting.</text>

            <text syncTime="940.934" offset="3867146">I -- to paraphrase Justice Davis in Ex-parte Milligan, it's a pernicious doctrine to allow any exigency or necessity to warrant a cutting down of rights which -- fundamental rights which citizens are entitled to under the Constitution, in other words, in Article III trial and the right to indictment and jury trial under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.310" offset="4012596">There were two other reasons given by Judge Goodrich.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.687" offset="4030151">One, that certain fringe benefits were extended to these civilians when they were overseas such as the use of the PX and travel allowances and things of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.423" offset="4081037">Well, of course, both Mrs. Covert and Mrs. Smith in the second Covert case had the same, if not, more of those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.640" offset="4129938">The same thing is true with reference to -- he stated that civilian employee goes -- brought of his own volition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.065" offset="4171630">Well, that's equally true as I see it of a -- the wife of an officer or enlisted man in the armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.474" offset="4209246">Now, we send -- our position as simply that there is no supportable ground to distinguish this case from the second Covert case that Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Covert and Grisham were all citizens of the United States, they were all civilians, they were all three charged with murder, killing their respective spouses, they were all tried in time of peace in a friendly foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.016" offset="4335470">The sole and only factual distinction here is that Grisham happened to be a civilian account and he was accompanying the armed forces overseas as well as serving with them and employed by them that he happened to be a civilian accountant and Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Covert happened to be the wives of military personnel and it's our contention that that is simply not a substantial or sufficient factual distinction to warrant any distinction between the three cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1558.068" offset="6335613">And so that, as an actual matter of the fact, common law types of crimes, homicides, larcenies, burglaries were tried by courts-martial even in times of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.244" offset="6376364">It wasn't until 1863 that these common law types of crime were mentioned by name in the statutes and in fact, I think as was said, not until 1916 that the other types were mentioned the -- the lesser offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.403" offset="6432998">On the matter of type of employment also Mr. Justice Stewart, Grisham was an auditor but he was a cost accountant for a military line of communications between France and Germany which was necessary not for the general civilian population but for our occupation troops there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.159" offset="6499976">And he was doing a cost accounting type of work but I'm sure that they were enlisted and commissioned personnel that were also engaged in doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2091.714" offset="8470235">Well, some of us -- some us might think that the jurisdiction is a jurisdiction and that you can't decide it on the basis or the exact kind of relationship that something is happening this time and hundred years ago.</text>

            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="2107.431" offset="8533138">Well, we think that -- that the -- that the -- the dispositive fact as far as jurisdiction is, is that there is no form of our civil judicature existing in this foreign lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.191" offset="8572113">And if I may, I would -- I think I would be able to try to show that this is the thread of the history to go back where -- where I was yesterday at the -- at the beginning, I -- I summarized four general propositions which, if I may, I'd like to summarize again and then go on try to show the Court that these propositions are historically accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.794" offset="8658526">And the first is that there has been a consistent thread since the middle of the 18th Century for court-martial jurisdiction over employees and dependents throughout our history and for the British history before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.882" offset="8714951">And that this is exhibited in the great deal of legislation and in a great deal of practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.721" offset="8734281">And the second point is, that the hostility to which Colonel Wiener and the other attorneys on the -- on the other side have referred throughout the 18th Century and thereafter was not hostility to court-martial jurisdiction over service connected personnel, but hostility to court-martial jurisdiction over inhabitants generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.150" offset="8815992">The two important historical materials which Colonel Wiener mentioned today both belong to that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.552" offset="8845563">The statute of 1765 which he referred to about taking people who commit offenses in forts and garrisons to the nearest civil magistrate, that covers -- inhabitants generally who committed crimes within the bounds of a fort or garrison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.153" offset="8907943">It doesn't cover service connected personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.571" offset="8917661">It specifically says, “People who are not subject to court-martial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.928" offset="8931035">It's inhabitants generally and similarly, it was pointed out from the bench, the northwest ordinance referred to inhabitants generally and not the service connected personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.385" offset="8964890">And that brings me to my -- my third point which I repeat again because I think nothing has been brought for to disapprove what I said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.774" offset="8994461">And that is that there are no affirmative rulings, no affirmative statements in the 18th Century before the Constitution was adopted at the time of the adoption of the Constitution or after the adoption of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.305" offset="9044616">And I don't limit this merely to the debates on the adoption of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.865" offset="9058826">I sweep in the whole history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.628" offset="9065932">There are no affirmative rulings or statements at that time opposing court-martial jurisdiction over service connected personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.053" offset="9099577">All the statements as far as we've been able to find are statements opposing court-martial jurisdiction over inhabitants generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.415" offset="9129044">And so, we think that -- that the type of jurisdiction for which we argue here does find support in the history and there are no opposing materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.291" offset="9172511">And then, the fourth general point which I'll also try to show is that this type of jurisdiction wasn't limited to war or actual hostilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.646" offset="9209919">It -- it stood on two factors, the connection of the person with the military and the need for the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.996" offset="9247326">And in the latter factor, the need for the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction, the absence of civil judicature, a phrase which I would like to repeat because I think it's the foundation of -- of the history of this case, of this matter, that's the most important factor throughout the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.958" offset="9315244">Now, to go -- I won't detail for the Court because they are included both in our briefs and in the briefs of the other side the various British and American statutes providing for court-martial jurisdiction in the 18th Century over civilian persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.684" offset="9378147">They covered settlers, returners to a camp or persons whatsoever serving with our armies in the field though not enlisted soldiers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.677" offset="9410121">There are a large numbers of British statutes, there are American Articles of War both adopted by the colonies and by the Continental Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.200" offset="9444185">There is no doubt that these -- that these persons were reviewed -- viewed as civilian employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.271" offset="9468426">The Continental Congress refers to them in the civil department of the army.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.674" offset="9482115">They were wagoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.762" offset="9486399">There were some artillery men, there were forge masters, there were quarter masters, commissaries, pay masters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.377" offset="9512835">We have set out in our brief both in the original brief -- in the opening brief in 21 where the main argument was made in the Guagliardo case and in our reply brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2381.788" offset="9630490">At this point, let me go forward into history to say that during the period of 1790 that Colonel Wiener was talking about this afternoon, saw this great number of instances in which he couldn't understand why -- why they had court-martial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.973" offset="9687228">Those court-martial papers don't indicate that anybody thought that the time of war was existing in the 1790s either because of an Indian war out in the Northwest Territory or elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.736" offset="9730278">There was no indication in the -- in the history of the -- in the material of those times that anyone thought that power over the -- over service connected personnel rested on war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.032" offset="9779493">On the contrary -- and this I think is too significant that when they were trying to exercise jurisdiction over inhabitants generally, then, they thought they were resting on -- on war powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.804" offset="9822542">The special result which related of the Continental Congress which gave court-martial jurisdiction over inhabitants generally for interfering with the army, Washington recognized that there is a special war power, but there is no such similar significance or recognition with respect to these service connected personnel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2960.736" offset="11946297">Then, in 1866, General Holt, the (Inaudible) Judge Advocate General who was asked to give an opinion on which we quote in our -- in our brief and with -- on the jurisdiction over service connected personnel in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.569" offset="12009618">And he says that it covered -- he says, not only as his ruling but he's giving a historical statement of what the general usage of the service was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.719" offset="12054235">And he said in 1866 that the general use -- usage of the service of the army in time of peace was that this in the field category cover units on the march or in a place remote from civil jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.643" offset="12121945">So, again, you find this reference to place remote from civil jurisdiction and then we come, I should have said this before, to Colonel Winthrop's own comment on the 1863 murder statute which provided for the first time that murder and other important felony should be tried during the time of war by court-martial and Colonel Winthrop -- Winthrop's commentary is very significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.483" offset="12213269">He said, “The reason Congress did that is because at those times, the courts were probably closed and the civil jurisdiction wouldn't be opened so it was important in order to furnish these offenses that they'd be tried by court-martial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.442" offset="12265096">So, again, you see the same threat where our form of civil judicature does not exist, Congress has the right to pass court-martial statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.393" offset="12296965">And then you come to -- to the late 19th Century opinions upon which Colonel Wiener and Mr. Kalp relies so heavily relate to post traitor and others, we think these are -- these are explained in exactly the same way because in the late 19th Century, the civil jurisdiction of the United States had covered the entire continent, there was no place where you couldn't get to a Federal District Court at that time and this seems to me explicitly in a few instances and implicitly the underlying basis of all those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.287" offset="12424547">They talk about within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.741" offset="12434369">They say civil jurisdiction exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.044" offset="12443564">It would be a violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to try these people by court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.434" offset="12465089">There is no reason why you can't take him take Mr. so and so to the District Court from Nebraska which is sitting right near Omaha in one of the opinions we printed by Colonel Wiener and I think in the appendix to his brief in the Wilson case and then, I come to General Crowder in 1912 to 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.800" offset="12554533">Mr. Justice Frankfurter, this was not first proposed in 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.377" offset="12572923">It was first proposed in 1912 in the revision of the Articles of War which had the approval of Secretary of War, Stimson and this appears very clearly from the reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.346" offset="12612733">And that the -- the statements which were made by General Crowder were made a different hearing to those years, some in 1912 and some in 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.663" offset="12646066">And, his -- he -- his statements I think are not inexplicable as Colonel Wiener said today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.600" offset="12689742">I think they are perfectly explicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.735" offset="12698311">He understood that the touchstone was the absence of civil jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.343" offset="12716701">He understood that there was nothing inconsistent between what had been said by the judge advocate general in the -- in the latter part of the 19th Century and what he was proposing in 1912 and 1916 because he understood, that the rule that they were applying only have -- only had reference to places where our civil jurisdiction existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.491" offset="12793292">It didn't exist in Cuba under our peaceful occupation of 1906 or 1907.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.374" offset="12812831">It didn't exist when our troops were going through Canada as he -- another example that he mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.872" offset="12830908">It didn't exist in other places.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.726" offset="12838327">And so, therefore, he didn't see that there was any inconsistency and I submit that there was none between that the -- the opinions that he had himself formally promulgated in the digest of 1912 opinions which had been issued in the -- in the latter part of the 19th Century and -- and the proposal that he was making to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.184" offset="12912097">Because he knew that at -- in the area which was to be covered by Article 2 (d) -- 2 (d) as it then was Article 2 (11) as it is today, there was no form of our civil judicature in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.974" offset="12959222">And he also saw that unlike what had been known to the people in the end of the 19th Century, the Spanish-American War had ushered in new era to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.277" offset="12996524">We have had occupations in Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.410" offset="13004988">It was also that -- that the war which was then pending in Europe in 1916 might bring similar types of -- of deployment of troops abroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="3580.231" offset="14424273">Colonel Wiener in reciting something from Samuel talked about military jurisdiction existing where a civil jurisdiction does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.492" offset="14461367">And he assumed sub silentio that the civil jurisdiction that Samuel was talking about that the 18th Century and 19th Century British materials were talking about was the civil jurisdiction of the other country.</text>

            <text syncTime="3609.117" offset="14539839">Now, of course, in many cases, British civil jurisdiction did exist overseas in India for instance and other places.</text>

            <text syncTime="3706.223" offset="14928227">There is something to be said to trial in a foreign court, but Congress has opted against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.092" offset="14951737">Congress has very decisively decided that American service connected personnel should not be tried in foreign courts and, there are reasons -- very good reasons supporting that judgment of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.119" offset="15011819">The first is that, foreign nations are not too interested in offenses committed by American personnel, which do not involve foreign personnel or the foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.882" offset="15058944">They are not too interested and this has been proved by the experience since World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.631" offset="15077857">They're not too interested in offenses by one American against another American or involving the American airbase even if it were -- even it is a crime under the foreign law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.758" offset="15114428">And then of course, many of these dealings, these offenses are not crimes under the foreign law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.801" offset="15138565">All the security offenses, the violations of the base commander's regulations, in some countries, narcotic offenses are not violations of the local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.578" offset="15181720">Safety regulations on the base, those are not -- are frequently not violations of the local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.832" offset="15206693">So, if there is no method of trying Americans who commit those offenses, they cannot be tried and punished at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.332" offset="15236681">And then, Congress was aware of the disadvantages to the defendant in the trial in foreign courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.940" offset="15259146">No doubt, in many countries in the world, Congress -- a defendant will receive a very fair trial, but there are other countries in which that cannot be said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.272" offset="15300420">At least in trial, it was not conform to our standards of -- or our views of what is a fair and just trial and Congress was aware of this, and it made its choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.935" offset="15351097">And in this connection, I think I should say that there is quite a possibility that if it's held that any of these service connected personnel are not subject to military jurisdiction, then the argument would probably be made by some of the countries abroad that that so-called, “NATO safeguards,” the safeguards which we -- which were put in to the treaty to protect the Americans tried in foreign courts do not apply to these people just as they don't apply to tourists abroad because the NATO safeguards only apply to people subject in military jurisdiction who are turned over or whose trial is had by the foreign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.349" offset="15504802">I don't want to say to the Court that this is necessarily a correct interpretation of that treaty but this is an argument which has been made and which I have no doubt would be brought forward, but if these people -- if these people are not treated as part of the military, then, the NATO Status of Forces Agreement with its safeguards does not apply to them in any way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3872.713" offset="15594245">I don't want to say anymore on that except to point out that we have no assurance that foreign countries will allow persons -- Americans committing crimes abroad to be brought to this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.462" offset="15657253">They don't have to do it because as the Court knows from the Gerard case, they have jurisdiction -- territorial jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3968.293" offset="15976573">And we have extradition treaties don't apply because extradition treaties apply where the offense is committed in one sovereign in one state and the offender then goes to the other State.</text>

            <text syncTime="3982.829" offset="16034670">The offense is committed in France and Grisham has not fled to the United States or he didn't commit the crime in United States and then flee to France.</text>

            <text syncTime="4203.640" offset="16917922">Most agreements, the NATO and I think most of the others do not make local nationals subject to our court-martial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.581" offset="16953657">It maybe that in Morocco, an Englishman is working for the American airbase there and it maybe that he is subject to -- to a court-martial jurisdiction but by and large, the answer that I gave to the Chief Justice is -- is accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.869" offset="17010813">That is that the great -- the bulk of the local employees who are hired from the area are not subject to court-martial jurisdiction because of the treaty and arrangements that are made with the local states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.617" offset="17061804">I come, Mr. Justice Harlan to the -- the nub of this particular case which is that -- the capital punishment aspect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.927" offset="17111124">I cannot argue of course that -- that it is harder to try civilians -- civilian employees accused of capital crimes in the United States than it is to try dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.347" offset="17168802">That factor is the same in both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4270.223" offset="17184266">The difference that I think that does exists between the Covert case and this case, the differences are two or shall I say, two and a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="4280.254" offset="17224391">The first, I think is that the -- the history of jurisdiction over civilian employees, though we think the history supports the jurisdiction over dependents as well in its specific instances, is greater with respect to employees and more consistent throughout the two centuries since the 18th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="4301.924" offset="17311117">There is a consistent line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4303.861" offset="17318849">Colonel Wiener could not say in this case that there were only two persons, court-martialed by -- court-martial -- of civilian employees court-martialed as he said in the other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.114" offset="17371826">There is a -- a much greater bulk of history and though we think that that doesn't mean that employees are different from dependents, we do think that it's one of the factors that has to be thrown into the balance in weighing the power and jurisdiction of the Congress with respect to capital offenses and the second factor -- and in that connection -- and this is the half argument that I've mentioned before, in that connection, we think that there is a -- a law -- a history of subjection of employees to capital offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.467" offset="17521246">The naval murder statute of 1802 that I've mentioned which covers civilian seamen is -- is a prime example which doesn't exist in the case of employee -- of dependent but which does exist in the case of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.961" offset="17571192">So that adds we think to the -- of the factors which throw the balance the other way in this case, that is the -- the more consistent, the more specific history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.349" offset="17616750">The second factor is that the -- if -- before I go to the second factor, I do want to say that I think there are times when history is the crucial balance weight and this is I think one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.725" offset="17678294">This is a case where I think history is a crucial balance weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="4398.223" offset="17696266">The balance went the other way in the Covert case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.011" offset="17707447">The history here which was not before Court in this -- in extent in Covert because Covert dealt with dependents and not with employees, swings the balance the other way for employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4412.900" offset="17754990">But, aside from the history which I think is the crucial factor, you do have a relationship with these employees to the armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="4421.605" offset="17789785">They are more functionally related to the armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.441" offset="17801174">They do the work of the armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.409" offset="17809011">They do the same work in many instances as enlisted and officer personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4431.902" offset="17830954">Their work is necessary for the -- for the completion of the -- of the program projects of the armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.467" offset="17861256">In many instances, they can harm by their offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.802" offset="17874631">They can harm the armed forces more than a dependent could do because dependents are ordinarily don't have access to -- to equipment which today is very complicated and very important electronic equipment and dependents ordinarily don't have access to classified information, things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.969" offset="17935235">So that, an offense by a civilian employee can have a more direct impact on the actual operation of the armed forces than -- than possibly a -- by enlarged in defense by a dependent.</text>

            <text syncTime="4814.456" offset="19361207">There is a part of the opinion in the Court in that case which refers to the power that raised on this and the court-martial clause and say, of course, each of these powers is subject and qualified by the Necessary and Proper Clause and I think that's been the historical accepted view supporting the army by what Hamilton said before the -- the Fifth and Sixth Amendments were adopted, but it's also supported by the fact that there's nothing in the history that Fifth and Sixth Amendment insofar as we've been able to find which indicates any hostility to court-martial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.798" offset="19506552">There was hostility to -- in some places to a standing army and there was hostility to -- to large military forces, but the court-martial jurisdiction is known.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.200" offset="19544168">In fact, the very same -- many of the same states which have proposed limitation on a standing army as part of the Bill of Rights which was not adopted but they proposed it, also proposed the exception in the Fifth Amendment for cases arising in the land and naval forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.292" offset="19604564">So, we think that shows that there wasn't any necessary connection between on the one hand hostility to a standing army and on the other hand, hostility to court-martial jurisdictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="5200.160" offset="20903999">I agree with Mr. Davis that history is very important in this connection, but, it's got to be history in the words of the old German Professor (Inaudible) as it actually was not some imaginary picture that we reconstruct like -- Now, Mr. Davis has built his argument where no form of civil judicature is enforced on what he calls the statute of the British parliament in 1765.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.385" offset="21048926">That's the 1765 Articles of War which began at page 91 of Winthrop's reprint.</text>
            <text syncTime="5244.045" offset="21079542">That wasn't the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5245.529" offset="21085497">Those were the prerogative Articles of War.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.098" offset="21103783">Those where the prerogative Articles of War made by the Kings and it wasn't until 1803 for some periods and 1813 for all time that parliament undertook to limit the King's power to make prerogative articles outside the realm.</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.657" offset="21182046">So, this is a simply a royal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5273.818" offset="21198660">That is the origin of it, not an act of parliament.</text>
            <text syncTime="5277.226" offset="21212244">And then, we get to the omitted paragraph from Mr. Samuel and there is nothing there about our form of judicature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5285.786" offset="21246516">He says so forth at home or in similar establishments which are of a permanent and domestic nature abroad where the ordinary laws have their force and are administered through the medium of the civil courts, There is not a word in there about our form of judicature, not a word.</text>
            <text syncTime="5307.498" offset="21333347">So that, what is this historical basis -- this involves employees generally, I don't think there has been a -- a great distinction shown between this case and Covert if the capital distinction or capital -- non-capital means anything because it's the same status, the distinction isn't there in two and a half years ago we couldn't point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.185" offset="21432090">What is the history of subjecting civilian dependents to trial by court-martial in time of peace?</text>
            <text syncTime="5340.187" offset="21464168">Time of war, there is no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5343.175" offset="21476080">We go back to the 1790s.</text>
            <text syncTime="5345.032" offset="21483499">I did not say if the Court please that the 1790s were a time of war because they've tried civilians, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="5352.201" offset="21512129">I -- I thought it was a time of peace when I originally wrote my brief and they are long because I gathered all the materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="5359.747" offset="21542327">What I said was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5362.161" offset="21552044">The commanding general could order a death sentence into execution only in time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.980" offset="21579316">He couldn't do it in time of peace, in time of peace until 1796, he had to refer to the Secretary for Transmission to Congress and yet Wayne executed in numerous death sentence as they also executed dismissal sentences and I started researching what did this was "Mad" Anthony Wayne, that mad?</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.173" offset="21660087">And the only way those executions and some of them took place at Pittsburgh in 1792.</text>
            <text syncTime="5395.205" offset="21684224">The only way those could've been legal would've been in time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="5398.985" offset="21699271">And then I saw that excerpt in the orderly book at West Point where Mr. Pickering says, this excludes the notion of its being at time of peace and the like don't -- they thought, not we think, not Your Honors has held (I v. Mary, but they thought that it was the time of war because otherwise, those executions for desertion in time of peace without reference to Congress would've been acts of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.994" offset="21791326">And they thought they were legal and Secretary Knox was to stick where a man who went by the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="5427.916" offset="21815045">He thought they were legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5428.777" offset="21818493">So, they thought that was time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="5431.749" offset="21830405">Alright, so, what have we left for this solid basis of history which says that civilian employees can be tried by court-martial in time of peace?</text>
            <text syncTime="5446.363" offset="21888815">Well, following the peace of Greenville which I agree marks the end of what they thought was time of war, there are about 10 cases in the 1790s from 1796 to 1798 about 10 cases of civilians tried by court-martial about half of whom haven't any connection with the armed-services, just citizens of Detroit, a citizen of -- of Mississippi territory (Inaudible) and some of these trials take place in a place where there is a form of our civil judicature in force namely in Pittsburgh, in Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5485.698" offset="22046177">10 cases of which five don't have any connection and number of the others, they were civil courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.295" offset="22068537">Then, in between 1825 and 1858, there are seven trials, five of which took place where there were civil courts and then one of them, the Ringsmer case, something was made at the court-martial proceedings saying, let's adjourn this and have it tried by the District Court of Green County in territory of Utah which is within reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="5512.969" offset="22155264">And they went ahead so that in five of those seven cases between 1825 and 1858, the civil judicature was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="5524.374" offset="22200822">One of the others was a trial by regimental court-martial out in the Indian Territory and then the other one, the Court get so discussed that they said where this man is settler's clerk, he's got nothing to do with this, we won't proceed further in the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5537.594" offset="22253798">So that, what does this solid basis of history evaporate into?</text>
            <text syncTime="5543.239" offset="22276368">Episodic instances, many of them flagrantly illegal and most of them beyond the bounds that the Government now claims for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.983" offset="22315342">Now, again, here is the problem of history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.097" offset="22335718">Mr. Davis of course wouldn't cite an overrule case to Your Honors, but he is relying here on an overruled opinion of the Judge Advocate General because that opinion of General Holt in -- in 1866 just a few weeks before the Milligan case came out which was in the 1868 digestive opinions was dropped like a very hot potato from the 1880 edition which in lieu thereof inserted these digested -- these opinions in 1877 and the post traitor ruling that we've said forth here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.950" offset="22479182">Well, now, where you have -- and in 1877, the Judge Advocate General said, this has been the consistent view of the Bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="5602.352" offset="22512828">Now, I don't think that the totality -- I mean, I'm not trying to argued by -- I'm trying to look through this mass of historical materials to come up with the -- with the correct answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5617.971" offset="22575208">This doesn't establish a solid basis of history because the first time that they came to consider it was in 1877, Attorney General Taft that not to open opinion and the Judge Advocate General wanted it reconsidered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5634.758" offset="22642395">And it was reconsidered and it was reconsidered by Attorney General Devons who had been a division commander in the civil war and he laid down what was the touchtone of -- of the boundaries of military jurisdiction from 1877 certainly through the 1912 digest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5652.085" offset="22711672">Then, in 1916, there wasn't any constitutional articulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5657.612" offset="22733824">I've had that -- read that testimony of General Crowder's many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="5661.248" offset="22748348">He -- he wanted to catch receiving clerk whose name Mr. Justice Frankfurter does not appear in the -- in the hearings just simply the fact that there was such a case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5671.826" offset="22790666">So, that you don't any -- I mean, when -- when you get away from the flagrant illegalities of Anthony Wayne, establishing a military OPA in Western Pennsylvania in 1792, when he get away from Wilkinson taking a citizen out of Detroit because his counsel advised the soldier to desert and tried in by court-martials for a violation of a military order when the magistrates were present, remove those illegal instances and -- and you have simply a few unconnected episodes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5705.425" offset="22925040">You have a history which is a record of -- of abuses, of overreaching but you don't have a settled administrative practice and as a matter of fact, none of these instances were brought to the attention of higher civil authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5720.330" offset="22984704">And then, for a minute, the alternatives, we thought we were dealing with the military dependents, perhaps Mrs. Dial in the Singleton case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5734.679" offset="23042069">And civilian employees and now we are told that it includes also contractor's employee and the dependents of the civilian employees and the dependents of the contractor's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5748.087" offset="23095672">In other words, anyone who was -- who was livelihood is somehow dependent ultimately on the military or the Department of Defense Appropriation Bill is subject to court-martial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5759.979" offset="23143320">We have a case in the Singleton brief, Mrs. Heath.</text>
            <text syncTime="5763.748" offset="23158366">She was the wife of a -- of a contractor's employee on (Inaudible), she was charged with premeditated murder though she got a habeas corpus and was turned over to the civil administration of the Ryuko Island where she should've been tried in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="5779.654" offset="23222000">Of course, there are alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="5782.511" offset="23233390">There are alternatives in all of these instances and the obvious alternative where you have the kind of offenses involved here is in the local courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5793.478" offset="23277275">And, as Mr. Justice Whittaker indicated, how can you make jurisdiction, the power of the tribunal to act in the premises, how can you make that depend on the length of the person's stay?</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.659" offset="23330043">There is a -- there is a very amusing -- that it's to me, it's amusing -- colloquy in the legislative history of the code where somebody asked, what about the -- the -- when they've -- they have no constitutional doubts about 211, what about the criminal amenability to the code of a visiting mother-in-law?</text>
            <text syncTime="5827.777" offset="23414471">And, the discussion indicates well if she stays a long time, well then, she's subject to it, but if she's only there for a short visit, that's alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="5835.738" offset="23446340">Well, there is certainly is a wonderful way of dealing with the mother-in-law problem because you said on that hate to see you go but if you stay any longer, you might be subject to trial by court-martial.[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="5849.395" offset="23500988">Now, not to close on that kind of note in the matter that's intensely serious, let me go back to the Necessary and Proper Clause just briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5862.744" offset="23554382">Three times in the last few years, this Court has said in its opinions, we do not write upon a clean slate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5871.151" offset="23588028">Now, between -- between 1787, when the Constitution was submitted for application, over 180 years to 1957, when the Government filed its briefs in the Covert rehearing -- when officers phrase nobody but nobody but nobody ever suggested that the Necessary and Proper Clause could be drawn off to enlarge the scope of land and naval forces in Clause 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="5901.726" offset="23710281">It is significant in this connection that the exception in the Fifth Amendment except for cases arising in the land and naval -- or naval forces and in earlier drafts which I think make its meaning more plain except in cases arising in the Government of the land and or naval forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="5922.214" offset="23792201">There is no suggestion except in cases arising in the land or in naval forces or among such per number accompanying civilians entitled to these whom the Government might prefer to try by court-martial or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5935.320" offset="23844655">I mean, that there is no -- there is no suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5938.099" offset="23855731">To me that the -- the strongest argument against the -- against the Necessary and Proper Clause argument is the fact that for 180 years, no, it never occurred to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5955.009" offset="23923440">We don't write on a clean slate.</text>

            <text syncTime="5971.439" offset="23989164">Well, I think before the Bill of Rights was adopted, there would be more ground for saying that we construe the Clause 14 with Clause 18, with Article III Section 2 even though Hamilton and number 83 of the Federalist issue (Inaudible) that the thing -- or that it remained invalid.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="6041.580" offset="24269720">Well, I think land and naval forces, if we're dealing with that, if we're dealing with the history, I don't think land and naval forces had any context beyond the persons with a military status.</text>
            <text syncTime="6055.145" offset="24323950">There has been too much -- decided and too much said about what a military status is and what it's consequences are and how it is obtained for me to believe that that is susceptible of -- of widening.</text>
            <text syncTime="6067.107" offset="24371806">Now, one of the points I think that -- that in the -- in the course of studies on this -- in this subject than in the looking into the military law, it was 1790s.</text>
            <text syncTime="6082.647" offset="24433977">I think I've -- I've -- on the basis of the materials, I've changed my evaluation of the material -- in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="6091.922" offset="24471071">First, when I started the Covert proceeding by petition in the District Court, I thought that there might be a distinction between employees and dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="6105.258" offset="24524361">I began convinced on the course of that litigation and the Government then didn't disagree that it is only a difference of degree and not a difference of time, that it was a question of States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6115.881" offset="24566888">Other point, what about the undoubted wartime jurisdiction in the field?</text>
            <text syncTime="6122.922" offset="24595101">My view as to the scope of that haven't changed because it's so clearly and specifically expressly set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6130.716" offset="24626239">I do feel however that that jurisdiction rests not on Clause 14 but on the war power because otherwise, there wouldn't be any basis for bringing all these civilians into the(Inaudible) of military tribunals.</text>
            <text syncTime="6148.805" offset="24698546">And closing with what I suppose is one of the central constitutional questions, are we to expand Clause 14?</text>
            <text syncTime="6160.487" offset="24745357">Let us go back to the original exposition, John Marshall, the great Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6166.668" offset="24770017">That the end would be legitimate whether it would be within the scope of the Constitution and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adopted to that end which are not prohibited but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution are constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="6183.616" offset="24837831">I think that to try civilians by court-martial in time of peace is not a legitimate end.</text>
            <text syncTime="6189.311" offset="24860609">It's not within the scope of the Constitution, it's twice prohibited by the Constitution and it's wholly inconsistent with the spirit of the Constitution and with the spirit of our institutions.</text>
