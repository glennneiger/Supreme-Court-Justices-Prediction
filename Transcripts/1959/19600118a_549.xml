            <text syncTime="24.242" offset="200391">These two cases both arise in the Western District of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.802" offset="222542">One is before you on an appeal from a three-judge court in that district and other is before you on petition for certiorari in advance of the Court of Appeals' decision reviewing a one-judge decision -- one-judge judgment in the same district.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.772" offset="302477">The reason that we have asked and our opponents have not opposed bringing the one-judge case along at the same time is that the judgments in both cases are identical and the -- the -- all of the issues in the one-judge case are included within those of the three-judge case.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.736" offset="390353">Both judgments enjoin the Civil Rights Commission from holding a hearing in the State of Louisiana with respect to voting -- with -- with respect to racial discrimination in the administration of the election laws unless the Commission permits independent cross-examination of the witnesses by counsel for the various voting registrars and others who may be adversely affected by that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.633" offset="545938">Adversely affected in the sense of (Inaudible) or -- or shame.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.451" offset="581151">The plaintiffs in the Larche case are all registrars in various counties in Louisiana, mostly in the northwestern part of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.668" offset="622007">The plaintiffs in the Slawson case are private individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.985" offset="639352">One is a former registrar and the other five are persons who have been active in connection with challenging registrants in -- in purging from the registers, persons who had already registered upon grounds which are usually highly technical.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.244" offset="748335">Two citizens, I believe, are required for us to the challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.045" offset="763591">There are two registered voters, I should say, as Mr. -- as the Attorney General points out.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.255" offset="784384">Both sets of plaintiffs have asked the court -- asked the court below for relief in two capacities as prospective witnesses themselves and as persons who anticipated being defamed by the testimony of other witnesses who testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.348" offset="864737">The court below, Judge Wisdom dissenting, granted the injunction and its theory was that these persons are really under investigation for a criminal misconduct that they're subject to loss of office, if in fact, they did commit a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.135" offset="959927">And that in any event, they're subject to public opprobrium and scorn.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.688" offset="978108">And that therefore, Greene against McElroy governs.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.494" offset="997334">And that under the Greene case, it is assumed that Congress intended to require the Civil Rights Commission to permit independent cross-examination of these witnesses and also confrontation and appraisal of the charges which were -- were to be the subject of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.364" offset="1096808">And that inasmuch as Congress did not, in expressed negative terms say that no such cross-examination was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.322" offset="1132648">The Court interprets the statute to require such independent cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.093" offset="1159711">And under those circumstances, the Civil Rights Commission's rules of procedure which limit cross-examination to members of the Commission and the Commission staff was held in variance with the statute and this made it unnecessary for the court below to go to the constitutional question, because it felt the injunction was justified because the rules of the Commission were not in accord with the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.253" offset="1280397">That is the only question decided except it also held that these -- that the Commission should let the witnesses -- these -- these witnesses -- these plaintiffs, know in advance, the precise complaints which were to be the subject of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.180" offset="1360123">In other words, to let them see the written complaints, what the Commission had received.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.532" offset="1385514">The other question decided below was to hold the Civil Rights Commission -- that -- to the statute, the Civil Rights Act of 1957, insofar as it established the Commission to be a constitutional exercise of Congress' power.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.469" offset="1453223">The plaintiffs had challenged that as a -- as a proper legislative act of Congress on the theory somewhat the same as in the Raines case, which was argued here a week ago, that inasmuch as the Commission was not limited in its investigation to acts of state officials and could in its investigations and hearings go into questions of acts of individuals and connects with -- in connection with voting violations that it was not a proper legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.128" offset="1603897">But the court below held that it was a proper legislative purpose and held it in favor of the Commission to that extent.</text>

            <text syncTime="416.683" offset="1770141">And this is after the court had held the statute, the act constitutional as a proper exercise of legislative power said, “The remaining pertinent and serious questions presented maybe as stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.610" offset="1817788">One, did Congress in creating the Commission, specifically authorize it to adopt rules for investigations conducted under Section 104 (a) (1) of the Act, which would deprive parties investigated of their rights of confrontation and cross-examination and their right to be apprised of the charges against them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="449.717" offset="1902216">And then it states the second question which it never reached, “If Congress did so authorize the Commission and such authorization constitutionally permissible?</text>

            <text syncTime="2313.792" offset="9358503">Now, the Dies Amendment which will figure through the subsequent history is found in our main brief at page 64.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.178" offset="9392044">Actually, it begins at the bottom of page 63, but the text is on page 64.</text>

            <text syncTime="2356.156" offset="9527986">And on the left-hand page, Your Honor will see Subdivision (s) which provides that “If a person is adversely affected by evidence or testimony given in a public hearing, that person shall have the right to do these various things.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.091" offset="9599770">And then if you look at Subdivision IV of (s), there is the expressed right to cross-examine in person or by counsel, such adverse witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.422" offset="9645014">That was the rider which was put into the bill in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.509" offset="9669360">That bill did not pass the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.494" offset="9677302">And so the following year, in 1957, again, the activity started to pass the civil rights bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.293" offset="9720560">In the Senate, a bill was introduced by Senator Dirksen, the minority with -- cosponsored by over half of the minority members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.411" offset="9753057">It was a major vehicle for the consideration of this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.744" offset="9770297">That bill had this identical language of the Dies -- Dies rider in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.747" offset="9794330">And Senate 83 which is Senator Dirksen's Bill is found in an appendix to Judge Wisdom's dissent at the very end of the record page 270.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.779" offset="9870503">I apologize for the scattered nature of this page -- it actually begins on page 269 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.550" offset="9909582">And then if you turn over the page to page 270, you'll find there again Subdivision (s), the identical provision that was in the Dies rider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.561" offset="9957648">There were hearings held on this -- on S.83 and in our reply brief at page 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.553" offset="10029537">Most -- everything else is in the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.165" offset="10036015">I'm sorry, but we got a few things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.069" offset="10055659">In our reply brief at page 10 at the bottom of the page is Attorney General Brownell's comment with respect to this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.858" offset="10086797">He is talking about S.83 before the Senate Judiciary Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.088" offset="10103724">He said -- now there's one other addition to the S.83 that I would like to make special reference to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.327" offset="10124727">And that is the provision for rules of procedure contained in Section 102 on pages 2, 10 of S.83.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.094" offset="10159731">“These rules of procedure are considerably more restrictive than those imposed on regular committees of the House and Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.283" offset="10188466">There is much in them which clearly would be desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.359" offset="10200795">We have not as yet had any experience with the use of rules such as those proposed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.632" offset="10221902">And we cannot predict the extent to which they might be used to obstruct the work of the Commission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.361" offset="10248861">Then he says how he favors such rules that -- and then he goes on one paragraph further down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.043" offset="10275506">“That I feel that the task to be given to this Commission is of such great public importance that it would be a mistake to make it the vehicle for experimenting with new rules which may have to be tested out under the courts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.675" offset="10326079">And this is only a two-year Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.472" offset="10333288">And you might have to spend those two years studying the rules instead of getting at the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.456" offset="10353246">Well Senate 83 kept those rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.390" offset="10368920">It was reported by its subcommittee to the main -- to the full Judiciary Committee, but it never got any further because parallel with it, there started in the House, the bill which ultimately became law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.367" offset="10420851">And that there were two bills, started by Congressman Celler and one by Congressman Keating, they -- the Chairman and the minority -- the senior minority member of the Judiciary Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.226" offset="10468289">They merged as H.R.6127, and the procedure in that bill is the procedure that is now in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.798" offset="10514578">It -- they -- that -- those bills from their inception had the so-called fair play rules in them, and in this respect, the Attorney General was called before the Senate, but before the House Judiciary Committee and asked about the Dies Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.178" offset="10596080">And his comment begins on -- on this particular bill that ultimately became law, begins at the bottom page 11 of the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.512" offset="10629413">The bill he's talking about there is H. R. 627 of 1956 which is unfortunately, left out for the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.021" offset="10655431">And again, he says the same thing that he did in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.930" offset="10667133">That the -- that -- that the Dies rider was more restrictive and that he thought that the members of the Commission would be men of such stature that the Congress would not have to use this as a vehicle for its experimentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.387" offset="10732962">And the bill came out of Judiciary Committee with the fair play rules in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.831" offset="10746650">It was the -- so that we had in the House, one bill with the fair play rules in it and we had in the Judiciary Committee of the Senate, the other bill with the Dies rules in it which we have expressly required independent cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.015" offset="10807463">The House bill passed and -- but not without -- without complaint, because the -- the -- the minority report of the Judiciary Committee complained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.949" offset="10855215">It says, “The rules provided in the bill are inadequate for more than one reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.950" offset="10875173">First, the House itself in the 84th Session -- that's in 1956, saw fit to --“ I'm reading from the reply brief the bottom of page 12, “saw fit to adopt a set of rules that are more detailed and stricter than those contained in the bill.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.930" offset="10939120">That are protection of the rights of all were provided for more orderly procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.947" offset="10959182">The membership of the House wisely imposed its own judgment on that of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.956" offset="10975169">And then he says if -- the -- the -- the minority report says that we should -- there were complaints of the Dies rider was not included.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.357" offset="11000769">And then when it got on the floor, Congressman Keating and Congressman Celler both spoke in support of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.704" offset="11030235">Their comments are on pages 13 and 14 in the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.665" offset="11046013">And at the bottom of page 13, you'll see where Congressman Celler says, “The rules of procedure for this Commission are the same as those for the committees of that House.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.190" offset="11080182">And then on page 14 at the top, Congressman Keating says, “Investigations by the Commission will be bound by the rules of procedure, modeled after those applicable congressional committees.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.239" offset="11124276">Then the opponents took up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.154" offset="11132008">And at the bottom of page 15, Congressman Kilday attacked the bill in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.436" offset="11157086">“The bill provides that witnesses may be accompanied by counsel, for what purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.737" offset="11178297">For the purpose of advising them concerning their constitutional rights, that is all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.428" offset="11197106">Even though the Commission or its own counsel develops only a portion of the transaction and that adverse to the witness, his lawyer cannot ask a single question to develop the remainder of the transaction or the -- or the portions favorable to it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.806" offset="11254575">And then in the Senate, after the House -- the House passed its bill, for these procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.968" offset="11275264">And then in the Senate, the Senate took up the House bill instead of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.134" offset="11291878">And it -- the bill was then attacked Senator Talmadge on page 18 of the reply brief and in which he -- he said that, “No provision is made for persons adversely affected by testimony taken by the Commission to be present when they are accused or later to confront and cross-examine their accusers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.364" offset="11372857">And then Senator Stennis on page 19, said, he has no -- speaking of the witness or of the person defamed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.127" offset="11407862">He said, “He has no right of confrontation or cross-examination and his request to subpoenaing witnesses on his behalf falls within the arbitrary discretion of the Commission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.186" offset="11444120">So, Your Honors, it seemed to the Commission that first of all, the statute told them what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.940" offset="11479124">They had to allow a man to have counsel to advise him as to his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.699" offset="11502216">The -- that subdivision of the statute limited the usefulness of counsels so far as Congress required it and that Congress in its debates had indicated that that it thought the Commission was being authorized to proceed -- oh, in the fashion which it now is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.997" offset="11583404">I might say there's nothing in the record of the -- of the passage of this bill to the contrary.</text>
