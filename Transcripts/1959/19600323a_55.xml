            <label>Mr. Wayne G. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="14.670" offset="162043">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.498" offset="173328">This case and two that follow it, the Duberstein case and the Stanton case are income tax cases all involving the exclusion from income, a property acquired by gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.817" offset="222647">The facts of the three cases are very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.183" offset="232155">This case involves strike benefits, Duberstein, a Cadillac given as -- in return for business favor and Stanton, a $20,000 gratuity given by a corporation to a resigning officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.057" offset="299551">We believe, however, that ultimately the cases turn on a common problem of defining what a gift is.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.454" offset="333197">In Stanton and Duberstein, the problem is almost solely that i.e the problem of definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.273" offset="368515">And once that question is resolved, the results there follow almost automatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.470" offset="397249">In this case, however, there are additional problems, the problem of applying the definition to the facts once the definition is arrived at and also an entirely independent problem of whether strike benefits are income from the definition of income even if they're not gifts.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.441" offset="477184">For that reason, I will, in this case, try to focus on the problems that are peculiar to this case and leave to my colleague, Mr. Edelman the development of the basic definition of gifts.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.784" offset="534549">The facts in this case are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.620" offset="549804">In April of 1954, the United Automobile Workers and their Local 833 representing the employees of the Kohler Company, in Kohler, Wisconsin called a strike of those employees in support of a contract demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.083" offset="611662">Shortly after the strike began, the international established a strike aid program under which the strikers were given financial assistance in the form of food vouchers redeemable at the local stores and the direct payment of rent and utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.835" offset="682715">The conditions upon which strike benefits were given were two - First of all, of course, the applicant had to be a striker, though it did not matter whether he was a member of the union as long as he was a striker.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.168" offset="732035">The second was that he established his need that he had no other sources of income and he is not otherwise employed and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.503" offset="769337">By November 1957, the day of the trial, the international expended over $ 9 million in strike aid to the Kohler employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.860" offset="814791">The money, so far as relevant here came from the regular strike fund of the International.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.606" offset="845824">That fund had been created by a provision of the Constitution requiring 25 cents of the regular monthly dues of every member to be set aside in a special fund to be used exclusively for the purpose of aiding local unions engaged in authorized strikes; that is strikes that the International Executive Board had approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.402" offset="953031">This case is essentially a test case to establish whether or not those benefits are taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.806" offset="982601">The respondent here did participate in the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.738" offset="998275">He was not member of the union at the time the strike began, nor when he first began seeking strike benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.171" offset="1024084">He later in the year in August, he did join the union, though he was not required to pay initiation fees or dues because he was on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.302" offset="1060551">The benefits that he received amounted to $16.50 a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.506" offset="1081448">This was the rate established for single men, he had no dependents and over the balance of the year, he received a total of $565 in strike benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="291.135" offset="1267963">The Commissioner, who has ruled that strike benefits are incomes since 1920, included that $565 in respondent's reported income increasing the total reported income to $3235 and that produced a deficiency of $108 in tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.067" offset="1355630">The deficiency was paid and suit for refund was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.560" offset="1373602">The District Court, although believing that there was no question of the fact for the jury, nevertheless, in order to provide a complete record, submitted to the jury the question whether the payments were a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.525" offset="1429504">The jury said that they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.729" offset="1438281">The District Court set aside the jury's verdict entered judgment for the Government holding as a matter of law that those benefits were income.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.252" offset="1472345">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding both that the strike benefits were gifts within the exclusion of Section 102 (a) of the 1954 Code and alternatively that even if they were not gifts they were not within the concept of income as defined in Section 61 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="365.129" offset="1563878">Now the basis for both holdings of ours can be told from the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.978" offset="1579238">It is essentially the same, namely, that since the strike benefits were payable only upon showing them need, their payment was as the Court said consistent only with charity and that decision is here for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.594" offset="1645798">I will deal first with the question of whether the strike benefits were gifts and later with the question of their income.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.939" offset="1679130">As we developed more fully in the other two cases, a payment for which there is no obligation and no bargain for exchange is not necessarily a gift for tax purposes, and the problem is how to decide when it is and when it isn't and as we would later develop, it depends upon the reasons why the payment is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.348" offset="1776724">If it is made for essentially personal reason, charity, affection, just an interested generosity, it is a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.392" offset="1812982">If on the other hand is made for business reasons, it is not a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.194" offset="1840149">So the controlling question of fact in this case as in the others is, why were the payments made?</text>
            <text syncTime="442.427" offset="1873063">Now the Court of Appeals in saying they were made out of charity, based that solely on the single fact that need was one of the conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.194" offset="1908172">It said nothing about the other condition that you'd be on strike and did not identify who it is who is moved by charity and one of the things you have to identify, to pay or to find out why he's made the payment.</text>

            <text syncTime="470.655" offset="1986017">That we think is the basic difference between the income problem and the gift problem, the except -- exclusive for gifts has something to do with the quality of the payor's act and it is to that that you have to look to make the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.890" offset="2058951">Now certainly it was not the union officers executing the program who made the charitable gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.503" offset="2097403">It was the union's funds, not their fund that were given away and in each of personal charitable impulses they personally may have had would be quite irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.974" offset="2135228">In fact the benefits were paid simply in execution of an express provision of the Union Constitution providing for and out of the funds established by that Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.352" offset="2188831">But it seems to us evidently that you have to look to the Constitution to find out why they were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.389" offset="2208893">The Court of Appeals doesn't mention the provisions of the Constitution and the respondent just barely passes over them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1965.491" offset="7965341">In 1952, respondent went to work at Kohler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.333" offset="7980701">In 1953, there was a union contract at Kohler for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.047" offset="7999509">Respondent did not join the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.861" offset="8010794">On March 4 -- 1st, 1954, this contract expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.812" offset="8030647">On March 4, four days later the workers at Kohler -- not the union, the workers at Kohler voted to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.521" offset="8065442">The International Union held them back and here, number one in the chain of reasoning of Mr. Barnett breaks down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.142" offset="8103894">The International Union of payor was the restraining influence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.106" offset="8123747">They say continuously, International Union urged them out on strike and then gave them something for going out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.431" offset="8149138">That isn't what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.673" offset="8154049">The workers at Kohler voted the strike, the record is clear, the International held them back as long as they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.979" offset="8179336">But on April 5th, after five weeks of working without a contract there was no longer a restrainable situation and the men went out on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.044" offset="8215594">Now, remember the respondent is not a member of our union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.836" offset="8230745">He did, however, go down to the headquarters and say, “I'm broke.</text>

            <text syncTime="2045.295" offset="8284557">They said, “Are you on strike and do you need this?</text>

            <text syncTime="2052.346" offset="8312769">Well, the need was very limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.592" offset="8321755">It was $16.5 of -- not cash, but a regular payment to the place where he lived at $9 a week and a $7.5 food budget that he could take to a store.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.005" offset="8379434">He was never asked if he picketed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.761" offset="8390405">He was never asked if he would promise to go -- if he would promise to not to stay out on strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="2285.429" offset="9245132">In my limited time, I hope to argue that expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.922" offset="9263104">I only want to say before coming to that that this case is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.498" offset="9277315">It's clear on this jury finding which was a totally correct and the charge was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.514" offset="9301452">If anything was wrong with the charge as I say because it's repetitious and secondly that is too favorable to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.915" offset="9327052">So, that's the -- it seems to me that's the end of the case, if you have our facts, our jury -- jury verdict and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.520" offset="9361429">Now, to answer Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question about that, what would the situation be if this man were a member, which I take it is possibly why we got here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.029" offset="9423496">If this man had been a member and if all these other considerations are that Mr. Barnett referred to were here, we say that the doctrine of equal treatment would require the affirmance of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.508" offset="9497370">In other words, everything in the whole law that's like strike relief is not taxed and I say everything advisably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.699" offset="9530180">Social Security payments, that's old age, unemployment compensation are not taxed and I would suggest that the Commissioner and the Government has played Ring Around the Rosie with this Court on that very point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.851" offset="9586813">The Commissioner said, strike benefits are taxable and they're different from social security because Congress intended Social Security payments not to be taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.354" offset="9628818">Then the Government came to this Court and said, “Oh, we didn't mean that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.815" offset="9646582">That's not the reason that Social Security is different from strike benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.940" offset="9663091">The reason it's different is because Social Security is charitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.131" offset="9687855">Then we came to the Court and pointed out that that was an absolute misreading of history that Social Security is given as a right not as need and then in the reply brief this morning, the Government says, “It's different because Social Security is public not private.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.882" offset="9746892">In other words, there has never been any distinction presented to this Court between Social Security payments and our pay -- and the payments of strike benefits and I want to point out to the Court the anomaly that the Commissioner and the Government are in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.438" offset="9813138">Suppose in New York City where strike -- where unemployment compensation is paid to a striker, it's legal in New York to pay unemployment compensation to strikers and in Connecticut, it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.923" offset="9883042">Now suppose the UAW has a plant in New York and a plant in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.998" offset="9903313">In New York, under the Government's argument here, in New York, we get unemployment compensation as a matter of right based on the previous earnings of the worker and it's not taxable, according to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.869" offset="9962872">But in Connecticut where it's based on need and without any relationship to previous earnings, the Government suggests that this is taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.890" offset="10002892">I just suggest to Your Honors that the anomaly that the Government's whole relationship here creates is what its fall.</text>

            <text syncTime="3038.916" offset="12259035">But let's say in coming back now and assuming he were a member and the jury verdict didn't apply for the equal treatment doctrine that I have been wrong despite this clarity and that the principles of income applied by the Commissioner should be disregarded by the Court and the Court should say that this is income because the Department of Justice asked it to say that even though the Commissioner takes roughly the other position, even if we are wrong in all of that, it seems unlikely.</text>

            <text syncTime="3600.769" offset="14506402">I certainly wouldn't have enjoyed being -- we're not in the same category of the other cases that you're about to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.118" offset="14535868">In other words, we got here first then along came two other cases which were joined with it by the Court which are wholly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.670" offset="14578082">I do not mean to reflect on the merits of those cases at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.510" offset="14593442">It seems to me under this Court's previous rules, those -- both those cases were gifts under this Court's previous holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.942" offset="14635133">But whatever there maybe -- whatever maybe the decision in those cases, it has nothing to do with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.573" offset="14661674">We are not a part of the said -- those cases both involve payment for services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.678" offset="14690095">One involves a man who did another man a business favor and got a Cadillac.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.266" offset="14708485">The other involves a pension -- or a $20,000 payment after he left.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.335" offset="14732727">Both of these involved the question which this Court will have to decide whether those are the kind of payments for services which defeat gifts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.543" offset="14773582">There's no suggestion in our case of a service of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.413" offset="14793017">So, we got -- it seems to me that while we are in this -- while this is one of three cases which the Court sat down to gather in serving our case is totally different whatever maybe the outcome.</text>
