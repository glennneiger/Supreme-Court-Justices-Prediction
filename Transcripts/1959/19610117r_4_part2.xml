            <text syncTime="339.512" offset="1357949">Now, as I said, certainly, the First Amendment applies at least as rigorously to the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.443" offset="1429734">They say, the distinction is that the integrated bar is an essentially, if not essentially, the integrated bar is a government organization while the unions are essentially private organizations that participate in a governmental plan of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.368" offset="1497443">And therefore, the integrated bar is constitutional, while this is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.265" offset="1516983">I would think that therefore, it would be just to reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.057" offset="1528163">That when the Government itself that is doing something which is alleged to infringe First Amendment rights, then that could be unconstitutional while this would be constitutional because at -- if there is a difference, certainly, the First Amendment applies at least as much to the Government as it does to essentially private organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.001" offset="1619905">I would now like to come over into the Solicitor General's court.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.510" offset="1634011">I will -- I do not propose to discuss his brief in detail.</text>

            <text syncTime="417.372" offset="1669433">But, I must describe it briefly to go on to what I have to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.240" offset="1712901">The Solicitor General's position in brief is that Section 2, Eleventh is constitutional, the union shop agreements are valid agreements, and that this Court need not decide whether the expenditures violate anyone's rights, because even if they do - he doesn't say they do or do not - but because, even if they do, the plaintiffs misconceived their remedy and the courts below gave them a remedy to which they are not entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.852" offset="1819376">Now with all the arguments Mr. Schoene has made and that I have made and that are in our briefs which we do not have the time to discuss, if all of those are wrong, all of the arguments on their merits are wrong, then, nevertheless, the decree below must be reversed, because the plaintiffs obtained relief to which they clearly are not entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.683" offset="1894713">That is an injunction against the entire union shop.</text>

            <text syncTime="593.577" offset="2374217">Many subjects of collective bargaining in non-railroad industries are subject of legislation in the railroad industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="605.160" offset="2420611">The reason for that is the need for uniformity in collective bargaining agreements in the railroad industry throughout the country or almost all the important ones are national agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.787" offset="2455092">And when you can't get it that way, then you need legislation be, otherwise, you're handicapped one competitor against the other and it's been traditionally that way anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="856.188" offset="3424653">Well, this -- the decree below doesn't bear to be modest resemblance to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="873.297" offset="3493094">The sole reservation was that if the unions come back and show the Court that they no longer engaged in any of these activities, that is, they no longer are affiliated with the AFFL-CIO.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.716" offset="3538860">They no longer affiliated with Railway Labor Executives' Association.</text>

            <text syncTime="899.613" offset="3598420">When they say in their brief as they do that the court below declared the fundamental rights and imposed upon the appellant unions, the obligation of dividing and presenting a plan to implement the basic rights of the appellants, they're indulged in pure fantasy.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.479" offset="3669891">As I've said before, the decree totally and instantly forbade any application of the union shop.</text>

            <text syncTime="979.857" offset="3919412">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.662" offset="3942609">The position of the United States in this case is that the decree of the lower court should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.033" offset="3976046">The case should be sent back for an examination of the various activities that are complained about by the appellees in this proceeding to determine which ones intrude upon the constitutional rights of the appellees and limit the relief to an injunction against the expenditure of the funds for those purposes which are an intrusion upon the constitutional rights of the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.951" offset="4119719">United States thinks there are several fundamental interest involved in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.611" offset="4150439">One is the fact that there is, as this Court said in the Hanson case, governmental activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.922" offset="4179592">There is compulsion to become a member of this union in order to retain a job by reason of this statute and the agreement made by the allowance of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.458" offset="4245734">Therefore, the payments, the dues, initiation fees, and assessments, and this Court carefully excluded fines and penalties as you recall in Hanson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.754" offset="4302994">But those elements of payment are made by a reason of the statutory allowance of these agreements for a closed shop or union shop to remain in these industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.360" offset="4377391">And we think that presents a different problem in regard to the constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.246" offset="4408947">Now, there are also the rights of the majority to express their interest in regard to legislation, political activity and all of the myriad of areas that are described in this complaint by the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.940" offset="4491703">They do have constitutional rights to that expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.900" offset="4511556">And those must be recognized and protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.605" offset="4534335">Then there is the question of the dissenters and their constitutional rights under the First Amendment not to be compelled, as is stated here and the Government accepts that, to contribute to an expression of ideas which are inapplicable or unacceptable to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.260" offset="4632973">Those, in broad outlines, are what is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.707" offset="4662753">Now, we say the statute is constitutional as this Court held in the Hanson case, because it never contemplated that these dues and assessments and initiation fees would be used for unlawful or unconstitutional purposes, that it was implied that when Congress provided that such agreements should be -- could be made, that any person who contribute as he was required to in order to become a member, in order to get a job where there was such an agreement, those funds would only be used for purposes that were lawful and constitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1259.607" offset="5038393">But it still is in regard to local and municipal office a contribution to the direct campaign of an individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="3118.365" offset="12473365">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.631" offset="12490501">I suppose my presentation must be all in one part and I will proceed on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.956" offset="12527804">I wish not to repeat myself nor unnecessarily to repeat or discuss what is not contested by the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.330" offset="12581303">I represent here six employees of the Southern Railway System who filed a complaint in June 1953 against the Southern Railway and 15 unions which were and are the collective bargaining representatives in that railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.284" offset="12673045">The complaint shows that a contract, a union contract, under 2, Eleventh was executed in February 1953 effective in April 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.898" offset="12743576">The complaint and the facts show without dispute that the railroad and the unions immediately notified my clients and the class that they undertake to speak for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.167" offset="12808568">That unless, they join the union or had in good standing within 60 days from the date of the written notice that they would be summarily discharged from their jobs in the Southern Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.037" offset="12880144">The evidence shows that most of my clients have been long with the Southern over period perhaps of 15 to 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.348" offset="12925388">The records as it has been stated show that three of these six joined or maintained their membership and three refused and had to give bond in this case to keep their jobs, give a bond in connection with the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.353" offset="13037401">The amended complaint and the evidence without dispute shows that substantial part of the fees, dues, and assessments exacted had been spent for purposes not germane to collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.533" offset="13114096">I might say that this is the largest record as my adversary state in their brief and that was ever put together in the -- in the Courts of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.816" offset="13171252">It was amassed over a period of some five or six years in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.974" offset="13191837">It had to be gleamed from places at great distance from Georgia because not a single one of the unions had its quarters in Georgia or its records there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.771" offset="13255053">It shows that the money was used to promote candidates whom my clients opposed and to promote measures of my clients approves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.189" offset="13320673">Those points are at the heart of what we are quarrelling about in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.416" offset="13349616">There was evidence and this evidence beyond dispute that much of the money in effort of these unions was devoted to foreign aide, national security, taxation, education and 1001 things like TVA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.782" offset="13411056">We haven't said much about those other things except they are important to illustrate the character of this entire enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.209" offset="13464764">Stated simply, the plaintiffs contend and show that the unions haven't limited themselves to collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.859" offset="13515337">But they have used the power which was given there under 2, Eleventh and the contract and various other laws which formed the complex of federal regulatory policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.414" offset="13573642">They have used their power as a club of authority under which they have demanded an exacted money and membership from my clients and the class of which they are a part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.559" offset="13646158">Something was said about the membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.625" offset="13674475">I have -- we had over a thousand pages of transcripts and some of those pages were themselves books or large reports so it might amount to 10 or 15,000 real pages as a specimen of what the charters in bylaws of these organizations contained and my Brother Kramer said that there was no question about ultra vires and we are not making the point of ultra vires here, we don't have to make the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.397" offset="13817522">We would be digressing to go to ultra vires here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.716" offset="13834762">And we don't have to make the point about the Hatch Act, because our complaint is unrelated to the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.715" offset="13878857">But as an example of what it is that we are required to join, I take for instance International Association of Machinists, their charges in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.950" offset="13955762">They say that among other things, the policy and purpose of the Machinist union is to urge the membership to vote only for and support candidates who are in favor of the platform which shall include many things mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.174" offset="14024620">One of them is referendum and recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.310" offset="14037159">National and Federal Income Tax amount, National and Federal Inheritance Tax Law, a National Presidential and Vice-Presidential primary law, the election of President and Vice-President of the United States by a direct popular vote, the election of all judges without exception by a popular vote of the people, public ownership of utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.895" offset="14139559">The platform also says that no in theory of federal judge shall set aside the law of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.795" offset="14167144">And that if the Supreme Court assumes to set aside a law of Congress by any interpretation as undertakes to a certain public policy at variance with the dec -- statutory declaration of Congress which alone, under our system, is authorized to determine the public policies of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.697" offset="14262753">The Congress may, by at the repassing the law, nullify the action of the Court, thereafter the law to remain in full force and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.212" offset="14304758">I could go on but it's not necessary.</text>
