            <label>Mr. Howard E. Wahrenbrock</label>
            <text syncTime="2.751" offset="114395">May (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="5.366" offset="124844">I would like to address myself to a question which arouse during the argument of these two Federal Power Commission certificate cases yesterday, that I think presents a good point of departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.670" offset="198092">And that is, how does Section 7 (b) affect the Commission's certificating power?</text>
            <text syncTime="37.057" offset="251591">And I -- I would answer that further by saying that it makes clear that there are two questions for the Commission to answer in considering an application for a certificate limited to the term of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.605" offset="313762">The first question is, does public convenience and necessity require the sale?</text>
            <text syncTime="57.728" offset="334242">And the second question is, does public convenience and necessity permit its termination at the end of the contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="66.738" offset="370291">There was evidence in this Sunray case, that the Pipeline United needed the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.022" offset="399444">Pipeline sells 1,247,000,000,000 cubic feet of gas each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.713" offset="430268">To maintain its reserves of gas, it has to acquire additional reserves each year equal in amount to that, that it sells each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.743" offset="478333">This gas involved in these contracts represents an estimated reserve of about 123,300,000,000 cubic feet and that's about one-tenth of what United needs each year, if it's to keep its reserves up to where they have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.268" offset="560462">Now, that was the nature of the evidence that was in this record as to the need for the gas, need for the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.891" offset="590973">But what was the evidence as to the -- that the public convenience and necessity would require or permit the termination of the sale?</text>
            <text syncTime="130.918" offset="627022">Was there any evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="132.791" offset="634546">The answer is substantially, none.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.175" offset="652100">The examiner described the testimony of the witnesses on that point and he summarized that in the -- in the following language, the factual accuracy of which has not been challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.880" offset="710928">He said that it might fairly be summarized by saying that those applicants and he was referring to Sunray and another, that has not perfected a review that those applicants would prefer not to be subject to regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.071" offset="771636">That was the sum and substance of their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.293" offset="788564">But the Commission instead of denying the whole package because there had not been any evidentiary showing in support of the termination of the sale, which it could have done, as Mr. Justice Whittaker pointed out in some of his questions, instead of doing that and just taking a negative attitude allowing the applicant to come back and come back and come back until they found out something that could be granted, the Commission said, “We will grant an -- an indefinite term certificate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="202.209" offset="912175">And it granted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.698" offset="918131">Meaning, that the applicant was free to accept it or not.Under the Commission's regulation, the applicant has a period of time within which to accept the certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.395" offset="957001">It doesn't have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.541" offset="965569">It wasn't compelled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.127" offset="975914">And under protest, it did here, under protest, in reserving its right to question this, raise this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.985" offset="999320">It did actually accept and has -- and the sale has started, reserving its right to question.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.326" offset="1028681">And the Commission accepted that acceptance or acquiesced in that acceptance upon the specific understanding that if the Commission's order was not set aside, Sunray could not abandon that sale at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.205" offset="1084165">It could not abandon it without complying with 7 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="248.922" offset="1099107">So that gas is now being sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.405" offset="1116975">Sunray says that there aren't two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.031" offset="1127528">There's only one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.127" offset="1135888">That question is, if we understand its argument, is the sale required by public convenience and necessity?</text>
            <text syncTime="264.961" offset="1163264">That is, is it required for whatever term the applicant has contracted and proposes in its application?</text>
            <text syncTime="272.657" offset="1193984">Is -- is that sale required?</text>
            <text syncTime="275.429" offset="1205060">The Commission says that the sale which is authorized to be certificated is this -- because of 7 (b), is a -- a continuing flow, the continuing open-ended selling of the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.585" offset="1261693">That's -- that's what can be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.475" offset="1273292">That's what is applied for.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.734" offset="1278307">That was -- is what must be considered to be applied for.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.461" offset="1289174">That is what it will pass on, if there is anything more, if there is determination, then that must be separately passed on either -- and you can analyze it either way you want to by saying that it's an anticipation of the 7 (b) permission to terminate, or you can say that it's a condition which the Commission is authorized to impose under Section 7 (e), the terms of which provide that the Commission may impose any conditions it finds required by the public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.653" offset="1421981">So, in the Commission's point of view, two things had to be proved, had to be shown.Only one was, it offered the kind of certificate that that permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.312" offset="1468583">Now, the question then was also asked, whether what difference it would make if the Commission's position which it here took was not affirmed, if the Commission could not do what it purported to do in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.112" offset="1547786">And Mr. Justice Black's questions about the procedural disadvantages to rate regulation if the -- particularly, if a shorter term contract were involved and particularly if it got down to one that could be terminated on 30 days notice, the impossibility of effectively regulating rates and particularly even in middle length term contracts of using Section 5 (a) instead of 4 (d) with its more effective protection to consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.455" offset="1693236">That's -- that's a large part of our answer to the question of what difference it would make.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.100" offset="1719777">But beyond that, even if all of the contracts continued, that were sought, brought before the Commission, continued to be 20-year term contracts, even if Mr. Richter is right in his estimate of how large a proportion of the contracts that are presently under certificate are 20-year contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.396" offset="1808906">Still, the 20-year contract presents a very serious -- further difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.620" offset="1833880">If applicants like Sunray can obtain 20-year contracts, limited term certificates, under such circumstances or if companies like Sun in the preceding case could treat their indefinite terms certificates for 10 or 20 years as limited term certificates, it would mean that at the end of the term, they do not have to comply with 7 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="457.160" offset="1931995">They've already received their authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.086" offset="1943698">And if they do not have to comply with 7 (b) at that type, if they may then may automatically terminate, that means that their purchaser, their pipeline with its fixed obligations is left without that future supply of gas, what gas remains there until those reserves have been completely depleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.136" offset="2039933">A natural gas is an exhaustible resource, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.248" offset="2052368">And while pipelines are growing, new discoveries of gas are not increasing as rapidly as would be necessary to maintain the ratio of reserves to net production.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.129" offset="2111927">And a continuance of the trend of the last two or three years of new discoveries in relation to net production could make pipelines hard to fill long before the end of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.260" offset="2188413">If Sunray and others are free to abandon their sales such as this to United from the -- from the production properties involved here, where United has built its pipeline in to take the gas, United will have to go out into the market and compete with others for the continuation of that supply or for a substitution for that supply and compete in a market which is bound at the end of -- by -- before the end of 20 years to be a short-supply market, unless we cannot rely upon present trends.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.242" offset="2344312">That market will include sellers who are free of federal regulation and the demand for gas will make it extremely difficult for a regulation to keep prices down.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.996" offset="2391333">Capital type of price conditions can be imposed when the applications are brought before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.184" offset="2416097">But if the sellers can sell their market elsewhere for high prices, those conditions will merely drive the gas out of the interstate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.085" offset="2451728">Sunray's arguments in this case with amazing frankness tend strongly to confirm this.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.804" offset="2478582">For Sunray frankly espouses its business interest, its legitimate business interest as it calls it, its business interest in being free at the expiration of its contract term to reconsider whether it will continue to sell its gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.797" offset="2546604">It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that this is a polite way of saying it wants to be free to use its economic power to the fullest.</text>
