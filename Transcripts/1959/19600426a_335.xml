            <text syncTime="28.337" offset="216691">This is case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.166" offset="239992">It involves the question which is similar to one of the issues which was discussed in the Sun Oil case in which argument has just been concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.642" offset="281893">The question here relates to the Commission's authority under Section 7 (e) of the Natural Gas Act, generally, to issue certificates of unlimited duration where the applicant has explicitly sought a certificate, coextensive in duration with the term of his gas sales contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.339" offset="364753">There is no question in this case as there was in Sun Oil as to rates whether initial rates, the rates changes.</text>

            <text syncTime="85.228" offset="444270">In this case, there's been no previous sale of the gas involved in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.137" offset="467884">If here, Sunray applied for certificate to sell the gas in interstate commerce for the first time, its application unequivocally requested that the certificate be coextensive with the term of his gas sales contract.</text>

            <label>Mr. Melvin Richter</label>
            <text syncTime="108.368" offset="536848">Basic term to 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.699" offset="546147">And the Commission clearly so understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.340" offset="560776">Briefly, the facts in this case are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.710" offset="574255">Sun Ray is an integrated company engaged in virtually all spaces of the oil business.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.921" offset="599019">In addition at present, it is producing and selling natural gas under about a 160 long term contracts, most of which offer terms of 20 years or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.880" offset="646875">And I might add by the way at this point that about 85% of the gap produces contracts in the industry offer terms of 20 years or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.315" offset="684596">Sun Ray also produces substantial qualities of crude oil and frequently in conjunction with natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.449" offset="713122">Sun Ray refines the crude oil into fuel oil, to gasoline and other products and sell these various products to the public and to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.971" offset="751261">By contract dated February -- January 1, 1957, Sunray agreed to sell United Gas Pipeline Company gas produced from certain lands and acreage owned by it in Lafayette and Vermilion Parishes in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.270" offset="820433">At present, Sunray is only known of proving gas reserves in this area are in a small portion thereof known as the “Ridge Field,” and this is in Lafayette Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.042" offset="863587">The total area involved here that's dedicated to this contract about 33 square miles of which Sunray owns about 7000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.312" offset="900577">A very small proportion of those 7 --- 7000 acres have been developed and have proven to have gas reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.390" offset="932968">Under the contract, Sunray is to deliver in United's tank annual minimum quantities about 4.5% of the estimated reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.585" offset="977690">The United in addition is to have a further right, annually to take up to an additional 50% of this, amounted about 6 close to 7%, just right 7%.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.918" offset="1019068">That's the maximum take of United.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.841" offset="1030771">As I mentioned before, this acreage is in the haul of a ballistic gas fields in South Louisiana and it's expected for the great deal of confidence that additional gas will be discovered in this dedicated area.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.389" offset="1088972">Subject to certain conditions not here relevant, these additional reserves are to be included under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.288" offset="1120528">However, such inclusion is only for the remainder of the 20-year term from the time when these additional reserves are discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.851" offset="1154800">In other words, if a -- if an additional reserve is discovered, say 10 years from now, that reserve goes into under the contract only perspectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.336" offset="1192730">And under the term of the contract will definitely be gas left at the end of the 20-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.531" offset="1217494">These specific quantities of gas as -- are to be sold and delivered for a basic term of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.142" offset="1247901">Highlighting the fact that the contract is for the specific quantity of gas, is the provision that of Sunray should use any of the gas for re-pressuring or recycling operations so that it cannot deliver the fourth or annual minimum to United in any specific year, the contract is to be extended for a sufficient period of time to make up to deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.567" offset="1333687">In other words, United has a guarantee, they will get the annual minimum for 20 years and it can take up to 50% additional.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.310" offset="1368586">That is the range under with -- of gas that's sold and under this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.190" offset="1388126">On March 11, 1957, Sunray applied to the Commission for authority to sell this gas under this contract to United under Section 7 (a) of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.176" offset="1436087">That Section provides impertinent power set out on page 12 of our brief, among other places, in full it's set out on page 57 and 58 of our brief but the pertinent language with which we're concerned here is set out on page 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.073" offset="1495646">And that provides that a certificate shall be issued to any qualified applicant, authorizing the whole or any part of the sale, on the leading language we cluster out as the sales service operation, construction etcetera, but the -- we're -- we're concerned with the hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.916" offset="1575058">Covered by the application if it is found that the applicant is willing -- is able and willing properly to do the acts and to perform the service proposed and that the proposed sale and again I'm leading some words, to the extent required by the certificate is or will be required by the present of future public convenience necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.784" offset="1666487">And then this -- it goes on, “Otherwise, such application shall be denied.”</text>
            <text syncTime="395.899" offset="1686967">The Commission can't make an affirmative finding that -- that the application is -- the terms and conditions of which the application is made accords with the public interest that has the authority absolutely to deny the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.001" offset="1747362">There are further provisions in the statute in Section 7 (e) relating to a conditioning but it's not involved in this case with no rate condition problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.581" offset="1785710">The application as I mentioned initially, specifically requested a certificate coextensive in term with the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.772" offset="1818415">That as for the contract -- the certificate being for the basic term of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.909" offset="1839000">After hearing and which the only evidence introduced with regard to the duration of the certificate was by Sunray.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.009" offset="1867421">The Commission, despite -- despite Sunray's specific request issued a certificate of unlimited duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.533" offset="1905455">The Commission, with the approval of the court below, assumed that the act established a presumption that certificates are to be unlimited in duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.716" offset="1958222">Based on this presumption, the Commission ruled that Sunray had not made out a case justifying the issuance of a limited certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.825" offset="2002631">In other words, so far as the Commission was concerned, all certificates are -- are to be of unlimited duration unless there is a showing of special circumstances justifying initial in service certificate of limited duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.855" offset="2062817">It's our position that the -- that exactly the converse is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.826" offset="2082670">This presumption --</text>

            <text syncTime="597.072" offset="2491643">The mere fact that Congress in act of the Natural Gas Act with various rate provisions, certificate provisions etcetera that that carried with it a presumption that all certificates issued out of the -- of indefinite duration unless special circumstances were shown, justifying the issuance of a special certificate.</text>

            <text syncTime="623.051" offset="2595610">In Mobile, the Commission's position was some -- substantially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.449" offset="2613164">In Mobile they said, “Sure, the contracts are entitled to or preserved under the statute but the Act by virtue of public utility filed rate procedures,” the terminology they used.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.121" offset="2667813">That -- that the -- that the statute permits the overriding freely of contracts and the Court rejected them then.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.612" offset="2693831">And we think they ought to reject them here again.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.877" offset="2706892">But basically this presumption which they have involved appears to be have founded upon three erroneous premises, that we understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.225" offset="2744299">One is an asserted purpose and policy of the Act to assure indefinite continuity of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.737" offset="2774288">Second, a cargo of policy derived from the provisions of Section 7 (b) of the Act relating to abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.835" offset="2802709">And third, an alleged the -- they're contrary result or enable applicants to “dictate” the terms on which they will sell their gas in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.175" offset="2852028">Now, in light of the limitations of time, I'm not going to be able to go in a great detail into the various ramifications of our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.143" offset="2887973">I would like to just hit some of the highlights here.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.955" offset="2907199">As I say, it's our position that where an applicant applies for authority to sell gas for a period coextensive with the sales contract, the Commission's authority is limited generally or I say generally, to issuing a certificate for that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.036" offset="2975535">Section 7 (e) of the Act which I've just read expressly so states as we read it, as the Court recall, that Section provides for the issuance of a certificate authorizing the whole or any part of the sale covered by the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.741" offset="3054320">When as in the case, such as we have here, the whole of the application is for a certificate of a -- for a limited period, the issuance of a certificate for longer period of time or if indefinite duration exceeds the bounds of the application and the contract enhances not within the Commission's authority under Section 7 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="760.818" offset="3146689">Now, this reading of Section 7 (e), we think does not mean that the applicant is able to dictate the terms and conditions under which he'll sell his gas in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.311" offset="3204577">This Court that latter in so called capital Atlantic Refining case last term, held flatly that there was nothing in the Natural Gas Act that precluded an applicant from standing firm on his terms and conditions from making a sale provided he haven't sold this gas yet, and this is that type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.357" offset="3280750">At the same time however, the Commission is not required to authorize a new sale unless it finds that the applicants proposed terms and conditions are in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.902" offset="3331009">If the Commission finds that they are on a public interest they issue us a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.730" offset="3350340">If they find that is not, they deny the certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.979" offset="3363297">And in the course of making that determination, there's no reason why they cannot take into account the term for which the sale was being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.074" offset="3399659">They do that everyday in the pipeline cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.588" offset="3413765">One of the most important factor in the pipeline certificate case is the adequacy of reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.333" offset="3440724">And the Commission looks to the reserves and if its for less than of prescribed minimum, they'll deny the certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.763" offset="3470399">If it's for -- meets their standards for of minimum -- of minimum requirements, they'll grant it.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.365" offset="3492864">And I might point out in addition that whereas here, we -- we're willing to sell the gas for 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.974" offset="3519300">In the pipeline cases, the Commission is now accepting reserves down to 10 and 11 years as is being adequate as in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.072" offset="3555662">Now, we want to point out further that this reading of the Section 7 (e) is nowhere conflicts with Section 7 (b) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.460" offset="3589204">In order to create a conflict, Mr. Wahrenbrock in the Sun Oil case and he'll probably argue here again, seeks to read into Section 7 (b), a general congressional mandate to assure indefinite continuity of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.224" offset="3652315">But Section 7 (b) is not that broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.535" offset="3665481">The only abandonment authority granted by -- to the Commission by that Section is lower and I'm quoting.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.205" offset="3692231">“Facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission or any sale rendered by means of such facilities, it's limited to certain kind of service assuming that what Sunray is doing here is making a service.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.665" offset="3753984">It's providing a service rather than just selling gas.”</text>
            <text syncTime="915.460" offset="3765164">Now, we can go back in that point to 7 (e) which has -- says, sale common service and as Sunray applied for was authority to make a sale, not to render a service.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.236" offset="3812289">But assuming that Sunray is engaged in providing a service, there would still be -- or even get to whether or not this is subject to 7 (b), it says facility subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.307" offset="3864639">That is the prerequisite, is that you stop there first and if you -- you find facilities, then you go on and service, but if you don't find facilities, you don't have any service.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.667" offset="3906017">The same broad reading of Section 7 (b), I might add, that the Commission have the case here was advanced by it in the Panhandle case in 337 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.538" offset="3957530">And with respect -- as -- as expressly rejected by this Court, properly read as far as we see it, Section 7 (b) is in complete harmony with our reading of Section 7 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="977.729" offset="4014268">As we see it, a certificate issued under Section 7 (e) defines the period definite or indefinite.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.162" offset="4044048">But it defines the period that the sale is to be made of the service rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.691" offset="4062124">We applied for a certificate of limited duration and that defines the scope of the Commission's jurisdiction to issue a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.661" offset="4090023">Section 7 (b) in turn applied only when there is an attempt to abandon service short of the period set out in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.482" offset="4125341">In other words, assuming that Sunray is making a sale of serve -- providing a service here and it has jurisdictional facilities so it's subject to 7 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.928" offset="4163062">Then Sections -- sale we -- and we applied for a certificate of limited duration and we obtained it, the Commission gives it to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.403" offset="4197021">Then Sunray cannot discontinue that self-service of sale within the period so it's covered by the certificate, i.e. for 20 years unless of course it has to get a Commission approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.446" offset="4245191">It's in no way free to discontinue as it wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.289" offset="4264521">Now, apart from Section 7 (b), the Commission appoints that no provision in the Natural Gas Act vesting it the general responsibility to assure indefinite continuity of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.900" offset="4314990">Section 7 (a) on which the court below rely is very limited in scope and indeed as the Commission concedes in it's brief in this case, does not reach sales of gas by a producer to a pipeline company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.289" offset="4372564">At this point, I'd like to pause for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.437" offset="4385102">Mr. Wahrenbrock mentioned the legislative history in Sun Oil of Section 7 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.902" offset="4406941">And he referred to John -- Mr. Benton as being one of the most eminent authorities on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.956" offset="4431182">If we pause for a minute and read the language of the amendment that Mr. Benton proposed which is set out on page 30, in the footnote of the Commission's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.738" offset="4482278">It says, “No gas company which is supplying gas to a public utility company engaged in distributing such gas to the public shall discontinue service to such public utility company without first obtaining from the Commission a certificate that probably convenient and necessity permits such abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.096" offset="4563780">This on its -- this on its face, doesn't reach a -- a sale of gas by a producer but obviously was only intended to relay to a pipeline providing service to a distributing company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.847" offset="4618742">I might point out in that connection to that read in context, Mr. Benton was talking about 7 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.112" offset="4651865">And as I pointed out before, 7 (a) clearly, and the Commission concedes, does not apply to sales by a producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.057" offset="4691571">In urging that the Natural Gas Act nevertheless should be construed as imposing such a broad responsibility upon the -- it -- the Commissioner asserts that this is necessary in order to protect the consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.786" offset="4746533">This argument however fails to give any effect to the provision of Section 1 (b) exempting from the Commission jurisdiction, language which Mr. Wahrenbrock in Sun Oil, were characterized as irrelevant, the production and gathering of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.415" offset="4805047">Section 1 (b), it has an affirmative grant of jurisdiction and goes on to exclude from the Commission's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.512" offset="4833468">Among those items excluded from the Commission's jurisdiction is the production and gathering of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.908" offset="4863039">This exemption as this Court has already recognized in Panhandle case and other cases, Mobile and Memphis, reflects a Congressional reconciliation of the interest of the consumers on the one end and those of natural gas companies on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.112" offset="4939839">To stress as the Commission does in this case, a need for an indefinite continuity of service is underway to the consumer's interest and results of invasion of a production in gathering exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.724" offset="4998248">In contrast, we believe that our position results from an a reasonable accommodation of the needs and legitimate interest of both the producers and the consumers as to this Congress had intended.</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.725" offset="5930297">Like Sunray, most producers of necessity are in the oil business as well as in the natural gas business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.845" offset="5954748">The oil business, I might point out, is not federally regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.409" offset="5973034">This is so because frequently, oil and natural gas are produced from a single well is a joint product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.601" offset="5997798">It's result of geological factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.520" offset="6013471">In addition, in the drilling wells of new fields, it's frequently not known in advance what of anything will come out of the well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.397" offset="6044923">Now, not only as oil and gas joint products but they are competing products as well because the oil is used for feeding typically about 40% of the production of crude oil that goes into fuel oil and natural gas' major use is for each place heating.</text>
