            <text syncTime="36.308" offset="248560">I would like to be emphatic about this point, Mr. Justice Whittaker, that there is no common law right to damages or in an employee for mere discharge where -- where those damages arise is when a contract is breached, a contract of employment but a mere day-to-day employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.840" offset="338735">Being discharged from that would not give a cause of action because the employer has a -- an inherent right to discharge any employee in the absence of contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="106.730" offset="530265">The case that is cited, which is a Georgia Case, involved a discharge of a railroad employee where they actually went out and accused him of not doing his work properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.509" offset="597452">As a matter of fact, he sued for slander and sued for damages for wages for having been discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.496" offset="625351">The Court stated that regardless of the reason, for any reason that was in the employer's mind they could discharge that employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.111" offset="659832">Now, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, while it is made unlawful to discriminate against an employee for the reason stated in this Act, there is no right given to the employee to any damages because of the breach of that legal duty to the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.297" offset="1132544">The cases -- basic cases relied upon, there are two cases, I have cited one and the -- the Secretary has cited one.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.293" offset="1160547">The case that they cite which is cited and approved by the case of Porter against Warner involving the Emergency Price Control Act, that case is clocked against Smith which is an old case involving the title to land in Kentucky and Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.642" offset="1245915">The question there was whether or not a federal court, acting in equity, could grant a remedy which was provided for in -- under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.062" offset="1303594">The courts -- the court found that the title to the land actually was in the plaintiff, but the Circuit Court divided as to whether or not the court, acting in equity, could grant the relief required by the State statute and the Supreme Court, this Court, held that equity could enforce that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.478" offset="1393246">The man was entitled to have the junior -- the junior deeds or junior patents to the land granted by the State, delivered into court and cancelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.480" offset="1433266">Now, that is a right upon which equity could act, but where no right exists now as in the case of Peter against Hargrave, an old Virginia case, pre-civil war case, where some slaves sued for their freedom under the will of one Hargrave and acquired their freedom by virtue of that will.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.687" offset="1522082">They sue -- they asked for an additional decree for the mean profits of their labor in the interim from the time that the will was probated until they were released by the Administrator, who had been procrastinating and vacillating and delaying the matter, and they asked for the profits of their labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.164" offset="1604002">The Court held that there was no legal right to the profits of that labor and consequently, equity in mandatorily giving them their freedom, could not grant damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.862" offset="1654784">Now, those two cases are old cases, but they are the cases or -- or a type of case, which point out the distinction where equity acts on legal rights, follows the law and does not go out and make new writs and grant extraordinary -- well, it grants extraordinary relief, but it does not grant new relief which has not heretofore been sanctioned at common law or under a statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="442.804" offset="1874631">But the fact that in those -- that there are cases in which the money damages could, by an undetermined cause of action, draws in law, I do not think it establishes as such that if carrying out that for which the extraordinary remedies because in all that's said and done, equity is still is an extraordinary remedy --</text>

            <text syncTime="1638.573" offset="6657651">That the Act depends necessarily on their cooperation and that if employees learn or think, if they will, if the decision below remains enforced that they cannot be protected from loss of wages for an indefinite period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.287" offset="6700492">That they cannot be protected and get redress for that, they are certainly not going to have much assurance under Section 15 (a) (3) that they are free to come in and complain or to file claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.669" offset="6786069">And it's -- it just become -- well, become apparent to him that that's -- protection, and I can assure you that our investigators refer to that when they -- when they are interviewed, and we take their complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.279" offset="6840508">That they will -- they will be protected against discrimination and against loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.091" offset="6859734">Well, if they are not given redress for their wage losses, then that protection is just illusory because it's commonplace knowledge that an employee is just as much intimidated and deterred from cooperating with enforcement officers by the fact that he may lose his wages for an indefinite period, as he is by the fact that he may permanently lose his job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.113" offset="6963806">And the thing that -- the public interest here is quite something -- quite apart from the private right of the employees.</text>
