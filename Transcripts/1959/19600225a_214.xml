            <text syncTime="12.146" offset="151907">He had nothing to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.509" offset="161416">And of course, out of the -- the Court of Appeals, that is the majority of the Court of Appeals affirmed upon the determine -- upon the decision of Judge Bryant.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.133" offset="203943">Now, Judge Bryant and also the respondent, cite in support of this contention, two authorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="55.655" offset="325987">Consequently, an expectancy and a drawing out of property cannot be the subject of an assignment at law of a valid mortgage sale, nor be devised by will.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.371" offset="368828">And Ladas answered the same effect, the author cannot dispose the rights, he may never have.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.399" offset="392965">Now, as I said yesterday, in -- in Fox Film against Knowles, the precise contention was raised and the Court of Appeals, in affirming said, “That while they recognize there could be no distinction between an assignment by the author or divide -- or devise that he can, having not survived the 28th year, he could do neither.”</text>
            <text syncTime="101.538" offset="509576">In this Court, I will say it that, this Court in a -- in a reversing said, that as the -- as the executor represents a person of his testator in the absence of a widow and child, he can exercise the same power that the testator might exercise if he had been alive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1397.521" offset="5693419">And the Court held that such a construction would deprive the author of the right to dispose of his renewal if his contract to congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.364" offset="5736782">Now, in the Fisher against Witmark case, as I went to mention before, Mr. Justice Frankfurter made a various -- history -- exploitation of background, explained the background of the historical background of this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.375" offset="5796864">And he said in the final analysis that there would have to be expressly set forth in the statute, something, some wordings, somewhere, to prevent the author to make an assignment, that is to restrict his assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.893" offset="5850990">Of course, there's in that case, the man had lived -- he had lived in that case during the 28th year.</text>

            <text syncTime="1455.889" offset="5926954">And therefore, even though he took out the renewal in the 28th year, he didn't have anything before that so this assignment was worthless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.532" offset="5957465">But the -- this Court's, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, writing the opinion said to the contract, that it would have to be expressed, any such restraint upon the assignment and that it certainly was not manifest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1521.730" offset="6190268">And he says, the right standards solely from the statute independently, of any right of the author, of any right whatsoever of the author.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.723" offset="6278248">Defendant contends, this is at page 28 of the record, “Defendant contends that since a designated person, including the executor derived their interest solely and directly from the statute, the author may not, by a prior assignment, deprive any of them including the executor of the right which a statute expressly grants to them.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1905.547" offset="7725537">(Inaudible) I think, I mentioned before, but I'll repeat it, that in Fisher against Witmark, this Court pointed out that the congressional committee -- in the report of congressional committee, which was adopted by the Senate Committee, where they -- they said, has intention of the statute to permit the author who had no widow or children decreed by will to the rights to apply for the renewal as we say to effectuate the disposition there of the renewal rights on behalf of the author.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.700" offset="7874121">Now, counsel argues, brings up the argument that on the same lines that the Chief Justice mentioned before and that is, he says, that we have to take the risk, it's a gamble he says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.437" offset="7941099">We can't complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.102" offset="7947786">He says, “Alright, you took these rights from this man, he had no wife or child, and never mind his age or what he could have married maybe had a child and therefore, you lost him anyhow, so what difference does it make?</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.564" offset="8013615">That's a risk you take, it's a gamble.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.147" offset="8023960">But as I said before, we found as a practical proposition, we have no difficulty once you've gotten from the.</text>

            <text syncTime="2004.239" offset="8120299">That is how can an author as in this case, who has made an assignment by his own deliberate act, defeat that assignment by making a will and disposing these rights contrary to his prior disposition -- and derogation, I should say, this prior disposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2034.622" offset="8241821">Judge Washington says, “It's not only in Congress, but in truth, out any legal justification.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.905" offset="8270973">Now, as this Court said in National Labor Relations Board against the Lion Oil Company, in which they referred to the prior opinion in that -- that -- Master Plastics, the fact that it also against National Labor Relations Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="2077.763" offset="8414438">He says in this case, 15 years ago, “We only gave $1000 advance for this kind against royalties, of course, therefore, this composition and several others -- I cant see how the compositions meant nothing, because the fact, this is the only one we're fighting over.</text>

            <text syncTime="2478.098" offset="10015744">It is not inherent to our position that there'd be any restraint on the assignability like this Court made it quite clear did notwithstanding what some people have interpreted or the minority view in which to have as this Court concurred in at that time, felt that there should be an absolute restriction against assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.269" offset="10088469">This Court did hold that these rights were assignable and it so held in 1943 and if it had perhaps held otherwise, there would have not have been other problems but it's so held and Congress has not changed the Act since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.168" offset="10144057">And so, we have -- to approach this problem that the author's right is assignable, the widow and children's right is assignable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2622.327" offset="10592632">If you decide and follow the philosophy of Fisher versus Witmark that in the absence of an express restriction against assignability, the right must be assignable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2655.144" offset="10723976">The original complaint in this case, transcript of record reference is on page 3, paragraph 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.797" offset="10758562">The allegation of the complaint was, Mr. Black bequeathed by will the right of his brother David Black, as the executor, in the Bank of America to apply for the renewal of said copyright, and said musical composition for on be -- for and on behalf of plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.678" offset="10830033">In other words, the plaintiff in this action started out on the theory that he was a legatee, that he was a beneficiary under the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.654" offset="10858036">But when in the trial court confronted with the fact he said might say -- by saying that you're a beneficiary, you should have come in the San Francisco Probate Court and claimed as a beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.447" offset="10901191">You should have asked for this as the beneficiary if this was to be interpreted as an agreement to label well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.934" offset="10923133">Not having done so, the decree of a probate court distributing this testamentary power, this property right acquired by virtue of the exercise of the testimony power, is a final judgment, it's res judicata and your foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.458" offset="10985200">Then he said, “Then when we find the argument that matters,” he said, “No, I'm claiming it by virtue of the assignment from the author,” ais assignment, not his assignment of his testamentary power of appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.822" offset="11030653">And as to that, we say that assignment you got it, it was assignable but you just didn't buy anything because it didn't vest, you bought a contingency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.901" offset="11067016">The very nature of Section 24 in the absence over an express restriction against assignability prior to the vesting of the rights creates contingencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.504" offset="11105364">This was the argument of Mr. -- Judge Frank in the dissent in Fisher versus Witmark in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.193" offset="11128142">He said, “If you don't restrict assignability so as you're going to get to gambling, you're going to have contingencies.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.320" offset="11160639">This Court in its majority opinion was not impressed with that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.422" offset="11173073">It said, “If Congress intended no assignability, then it should have said so.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2887.129" offset="11651845">It would be a contingency, I think they would become general predators of the State for breach of contract perhaps if the contract was otherwise enforceable in California but they would have not been entitled to specific performance because the executor or administrator took nothing in such an event.</text>
