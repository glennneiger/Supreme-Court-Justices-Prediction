            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 167, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation, et al., Petitioners, versus Shell Oil Company and number 170, Federal Power Commission, Petitioner, versus Shell Oil Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.432" offset="173119">Mr. Gatchell, you may now proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Willard W. Gatchell</label>
            <text syncTime="19.732" offset="182314">Mr. Chief Justice, and Associate Justices, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.042" offset="211571">We ask for the privilege of opening the argument in this case because to us, it presents more than merely a dispute between two private litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.911" offset="255039">It concerns a matter of regulatory control which we regard as rather vital.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.695" offset="282102">In these cases, the Court is asked to decide whether or not a favored-nation escalation clause in a contract of Shell Oil Company and The Texas Gas Transmission Company was triggered, that is made effective by a higher rate paid by Texas Gas under another contract with another producer, Atlantic Refining Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.116" offset="387845">The answer to this question is required in order to determine the effective rates to be charged by Shell under the Natural Gas Act as of June 7, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.644" offset="441971">The date used by the Federal Power Commission to start the regulatory controls under that act as applied to independent producers of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.490" offset="485334">The Court well remembers that the Phillips Petroleum Company case was decided on June 7, 1954, holding independent producers to be subject to the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.406" offset="536952">As Shell entered into its contract in 1951 with Louisiana Natural Gas Company, a subsidiary of Texas Gas and then the subsidiary was later merged into Texas Gas and we will refer to this 1951 contract as the Shell contract because it is the first one that needs attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.084" offset="627754">The favored-nation escalation clause in this Shell contract provide that if anytime the buyer enters into a contract providing for the purchase of gas produced by a field within 50 miles of the Shell field and the price payable by the buyer is higher than the price under the 1951 Shell contract, the buyer has to pay Shell the same higher price.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.070" offset="731617">The 1951 Shell contract calls for a price of 8.997 a thousand cubic feet for all gas purchased after January 1, 1952 through December 1956, thus, higher price is called for under the escalation clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.256" offset="812387">On June 7, 1954, Texas Gas was the buyer and this 8.97 -- 997-cent rate would, if it -- the rate fixed in the contract applied, the either rate which would be the initial rate used by the Commission and by the companies as the start of their service under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.145" offset="911966">Now, the contract which is said that triggered the Shell contract was entered into in 1943 by Atlantic Refining Company as a seller and the United States Government as the -- as the buyer, and then the United States Government has transferred and finally, Texas Gas gets it as buyer and -- and Texas Gas was the buyer under both contracts on June 7, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.221" offset="1024293">The gas was sold under this Atlantic contract originally at 2.2 cents per Mcf and the contract was to continue for the producing life of the field but not longer than 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.570" offset="1077687">There's a slight error in the Court of Appeals' decision where it refers to a 20-year contract whereas it actually is a 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.268" offset="1112482">The seller agreed to sell and the buyer agreed to buy under this Atlantic contract specified daily quantities of gas, and that's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.403" offset="1160965">Under the Atlantic contract, no price was fixed after the first five years, started off and said that during the first five years of the 2.2 cents and then after that, the buyer and the seller were to reach an agreement as to the price for the second five year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.688" offset="1246124">And after -- in doing that, they would consider the prevailing market price for gas sold in that area, Southeast and Southwestern Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.895" offset="1290951">And then the price for each succeeding five-year period would be similarly determined or agreed upon by the parties.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="304.785" offset="1322506">What happened if they failed to agree?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="willard_w_gatchell" startTime="306.947" stopTime="426.113">
            <label>Mr. Willard W. Gatchell</label>
            <text syncTime="306.947" offset="1331179">There was a provision for arbitration and that's the most important because to us, the arbitration agreement means that this 1943 contract continues for 25 years and that the mere incident of a price adjustment or a price determination could be by the parties if they were able to do so or under arbitration, so that to us, it was not a new contract entered into in 1953 when the third five-year period started.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.000" offset="1491362">Now, there was an agreement for the second five-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.960" offset="1503169">They had a letter agreement and then it went up, and for a few months from September, they had a six months period where they did agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.463" offset="1541204">On September of 1953, they did agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.753" offset="1562415">And then they come up to this period which really affects what we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.165" offset="1604002">Under the Atlantic contract, there was a dispute as to just how much the third period should cover, what price should be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.942" offset="1663143">And it was not until February of 1954, and I mentioned that because you see that is after September 1st, 1953 when the third period started.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.337" offset="1708701">Not until February 1954 that they decided that they would pay, that Texas Gas would pay and as far as Atlantic was concerned, it was satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.162" offset="1756035">They would pay 12.5 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.386" offset="1768887">So that from September 1953 on, for the balance of the five-year term, the rate was 12.5 cents.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="426.113" stopTime="431.584">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="426.113" offset="1807862">That's the letter of February 17, 1954 fixing the price of September 1 preceding.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="willard_w_gatchell" startTime="431.584" stopTime="722.091">
            <label>Mr. Willard W. Gatchell</label>
            <text syncTime="431.584" offset="1829700">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.221" offset="1832208">And we call that the 1953 agreement although it was entered into in February.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.538" offset="1853524">It's the 1953 agreement because that's in the third period.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.783" offset="1874526">Now, when Shell, a month later, that is Monday after this February 17th later -- letter, found that there had been an -- an escalation under the Atlantic contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.371" offset="1936906">Shell told the -- the buyer, Texas Gas, in 19 -- March 1954 that its price had gone up automatically with the increase in the price paid to Atlantic and therefore, under the Shell contract, instead of an 8.9 cent price, there was a 12-cent -- 12.5-cent price which should be paid by Texas Gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.770" offset="2046412">And then as I said, this Court decided in June of 1954 right after this, decided that the independent producer was subject to the Natural Gas Act and the Commission started to impose the controls called for by that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.692" offset="2110151">One of the controls of course was the filing of rate schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.240" offset="2128332">Now, independent producers don't have rate schedules and tariff, one where they agree to sell the whole, those who may apply such as an interstate pipeline may do but they have individual contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.263" offset="2180472">And we were -- we thought we were faced with a prospect of having a great many thousand individual contracts filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.437" offset="2213073">Well, we didn't estimate that there'll be 46,000 by April 1960 but that's what has happened, and then some 10,000 -- over 10,000 basic contracts that have been filed with us and with no increase in staff and the tremendous burden which we anticipated, the Commission did the best thing it could and tried to see that the filing requirements were met properly and rather than they require, all of these producers to place their individual contracts into a tariff form, they said, “File your contracts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="563.898" offset="2358941">But by way of assisting in an understanding of what rate would be involved, they ask that they file also with the contract, but really not a rate schedule, they filed a billing statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.405" offset="2412962">At the end of each month, the company that buys submits a statement to the producer and says, “We have taken so many cubic feet of gas and under our contract, the rate for that month is -- 8 cents,” or whatever it might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.104" offset="2483806">And those billing statements assist us and assist those who come before us in understanding what exactly is the agreement stated in these very confusing individual contracts that the producers have.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.422" offset="2545037">They are long, they are complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.054" offset="2551620">You will find two contracts involved here taking up some 14 printed pages with very intricate provisions as to temperatures and impurities and there is the pressure and place of taking and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.575" offset="2609716">And -- and then also, on page 65 of the record, the Shell contract list, the -- the rates which would obtain during certain periods, absent the escalation clause and then goes on and has the escalation clause set up very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.266" offset="2688397">Now, we have printed for the convenience of the Court, the escalation clauses that are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.348" offset="2716714">The first, the Shell is on page -- starts on page four of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.669" offset="2742000">And -- and I think the -- just a brief reading of that, hasty reading of that may assist if at any time after December 31, 1951, the buyer that is Texas Gas at this time, shall enter into a contract providing for the purchase by it of gas produced from the field or fields located and delivered to buyer within a radius of 50 miles, then buyers to notify seller of that fact in the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.107" offset="2863835">If the price per thousand cubic feet is more under the other contract, then it was another Shell contract, then the shell contract price goes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.091" offset="2911692">Now, what was it that triggered it?</text>
            <text syncTime="705.828" offset="2926634">Well, Shell says that this contract under which Texas Gas on June 4, 19 -- June 7, 1954 was buying gas from Atlantic Refining, another producer that that was a new contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="737.744" offset="3054320">At the end of the first five-year period, buyer and seller are to reach an agreement as to the price for gas sold and delivered under this contract during the second five-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.217" offset="3104266">The price to be paid during each second five-year period is to be agreed upon at the beginning of such period after a survey of prevailing prices for gas sold in similar quantities in the Southwestern part of Louisiana and so, during each succeeding part and then arbitration if they are unable to agree.</text>

            <text syncTime="950.278" offset="3904449">No, You Honor, Mr. Justice Whitaker, I think really, this letter of February 17th demonstrates what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.418" offset="3937050">They continue to pay the prior price.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.484" offset="3949275">But on February 17, 1954, they agreed to go back to the beginning of the third period, September 01, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.213" offset="3988250">Agreed to go back and just pay 12.5 cents from that September 1st on.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.857" offset="4014791">An absence -- absent that February 17's letter, I would think that the parties would have continued to go under the prior rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.157" offset="4055960">But always, there would be an obligation upon the pipeline purchaser that is Texas Gas, to make up any difference, ultimately, determined either by agreement among the parties or by arbitration between the price for the second or third or fourth year five-year period over what have be -- previously been collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.439" offset="4161076">I think that letter of February 17th is most significant in that aspect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.235" offset="4184273">Now, I -- I will deal in my presentation with what we regard as the limited scope of judicial review under the facts which I had given so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.638" offset="4233906">The -- we think the Third Circuit, reading this as a strictly legal document, the contract which could be interpreted by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.830" offset="4278732">But that was all that there was to it and that therefore, since the contract, the Third Circuit called for a new agreement every five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.802" offset="4322617">That new agreement under the Atlantic contract became a new agreement under the Shell and automatically triggered the escalation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.948" offset="4371205">If it did trigger the escalation of the Shell contract, then on June 7, 1954, the rate was 12.5 cents as claimed by Shell and not 8.997 as found by the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.314" offset="4440586">Now, the -- when the Commission examined the billing statement that was filed with this Shell contract, I noticed the discrepancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.884" offset="4482905">It said, “Well, we will not receive nor reject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.534" offset="4497533">We'll not accept nor reject the contract, but we will ask for an explanation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.307" offset="4520626">And we -- we set that letter to them in January of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.876" offset="4542882">It was not until February of 1957 that the explanation was given and it was then given not because there was a continuing situation, but because they had applied in February of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.938" offset="4595127">Two years later, they applied for an increase in the Shell rate to 16 and -- and 34 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.508" offset="4633370">We have -- we had suspended that and -- and set it down for hearing, then it was placed into effect as it could be at the end of the suspension period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.030" offset="4671509">And we have not yet gotten around to a determination as to whether that is a just and reasonable rate, but it is being collected at 16 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.970" offset="4707244">But that means that from September 1, 1953 up to February 1957, there is a rate in dispute between these parties which amounts to some $10,497 every month on the average, going on all of this time, because Texas has paid the 8.997 rate right along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.360" offset="4824795">And Shell for some reason which escaped me didn't press its claim, either with the company or before the Commission, didn't press its claim during this interval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.587" offset="4869726">Now, the reason these escalation clauses to us are a little more than merely just concerning two companies which are before the Court is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.070" offset="4911626">Many -- many of these contracts originally with the producers had to be for a long periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.188" offset="4940152">It cost a lot of money to put in the pipe and compressor stations and other facilities to get gas from this producing fields up to the markets where they -- where the gas can be sold most profitably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.158" offset="4991979">And the pipeline companies cannot afford to undertake those -- that expensive investment nor will the financial houses underwrite them and issue these securities until there is a -- an assurance of a supply for a reasonable period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.121" offset="5051852">Most of them as the Shell contract are for 20 years, but some of them as the Atlantic contract, are for 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.023" offset="5079437">And -- and the producers in wanting to protect themselves economically against the inflation that has gone on in -- in the oil field of steadily rising prices have used these escalation clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.352" offset="5136802">Originally, they were fixed escalations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.397" offset="5144952">Every two years or five years or whatever the period might be would -- the price would go up one cent, two cents, or three cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.835" offset="5174732">And under a contract like that, you could look at it and say at the beginning exactly what would be paid and that the pipeline purchaser would be able to tell its customers exactly what they would have to pay because all of the rates could be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.505" offset="5245367">But they found that those fixed periodic escalations did not give enough return to the producers and so they resorted to these indefinite pricing agreements which we call escalation clauses, where price might go up by reason or the buyer under this particular contract paying more to another buyer or because he enters into a new contract to another producer or where he enters into a new contract with some other producer or because there's a rise in the field prices or a commodity index or -- or some other fixed -- some other indefinite provision whereby at some time, in some manner, there would be an additional price paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.671" offset="5422059">Now, the two kinds with which we are concerned right here are very, very simply stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.037" offset="5451525">One, which we think the Court mistakenly attributed to the Atlantic contract is where a producer -- where a pipeline company enters into a new contract for a new supply of gas and pays more than he is playing -- paying to his old supplier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.508" offset="5537416">And we don't think that was this situation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.734" offset="5546297">We think that this situation was where the pipeline company has an agreement that could go out and say, “If we pay anything more than -- to anybody else, then we will pay you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.581" offset="5609723">Now, we think that under the Texas agreement, Texas Gas Company agreement with Atlantic, they were not obligated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.572" offset="5645667">They were not obligated to pay Shell by reason to the fact that Shell had put into its contract this escalation clause which I -- which I read to you on page five of our brief that only if there was a new contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.322" offset="5724662">When it came before the Commission after the hearing had been held and that all of the testimony taken they had any -- that anyone offered, the trial examiner, hearing examiner said, "Why, this obviously is a contract that Texas has now entered into calling for a 12-cent price and therefore, the Shell price automatically went up to 12.5 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.630" offset="5837928">And he allowed them 12.5 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.089" offset="5847751">The Federal Power Commission on the other hand said this is not a new contract and it said three things have -- would control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.324" offset="5880665">First, the rate actually being paid on June 7, 1954 was 8.997 cents and therefore, that is the rate which we will recognize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.546" offset="5929566">Now, that ground as subject had only been dropped because of some cases which have come up since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.120" offset="5959868">But the Commission also said, "The contract that Shell has with Texas Gas calls for a new agreement to be entered into for the purchase of gas from some other producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.311" offset="6024652">And this obviously is not a new agreement with -- between Atlantic and Texas Gas and therefore, the rate has not been escalated to 12.5 cents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1603.727" offset="6518262">Well, I think -- I think, Your Honor, the answer to both of those question is -- is a very simple statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.627" offset="6557863">If a company knows that by entering into a contract with another producer, the pipeline will have to pay more for a gas, which it is purchasing in this case from Shell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.897" offset="6614915">And if its facilities for taking gas, for transporting gas in interstate commerce, are pretty well filled up anyhow, it will not go into that field to get a new supply of gas, to get an additional supply of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.064" offset="6679594">And therefore, the pipeline company does retain some major of control over what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.541" offset="6713553">Now, when the contract provides that the pipeline company has to pay the producer more whenever it pays anybody else more for its gas, then it makes no difference whether there is a new contract or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.747" offset="6782412">When the -- the second contract calls for a higher price, then the first contract automatically is raised or escalated up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.796" offset="6818565">And the pipeline company knows that it is inevitable that it will have to pay more for gas because that has been the steady consistent history in the producing field all this time that the prices are going up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.710" offset="6882200">And therefore, the pipeline can -- can count on having to pay more and you are taking away from the pipeline the control which it would have and some of them exercise it, have to stay out of a field where an escalation in it and the price of gas which it is already purchasing at one rate would increase it -- its cost as producing cost so much that it cannot afford to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.483" offset="6985331">And they need this language in order to protect them, the companies that are buying, the pipeline companies that are buying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.685" offset="7026082">I -- I think myself as when this Court had the Memphis case before it that this Court very definitely took the only view which would be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.595" offset="7069759">You remember that was whether -- whether they had a service agreement, where they had a service agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.845" offset="7106748">The question was whether that came under the Mobile doctrine that there could not be a unilateral change just on the part of the pipeline that the customers -- the pipeline had to agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.711" offset="7154186">And -- and this Court said that the service agreement differs from a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.590" offset="7173726">But it went on and -- and on page 114 of 358 U.S., the Court says, "There remains the question whether United's service agreements reserved to it the power to make rate changes in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.512" offset="7233390">The Commission found that the agreements so intended, but on it's view of the case that the Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to decide the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.653" offset="7265991">We think it would be both unnecessary and dilatory for us to remand the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of that issue, which involves matters peculiarly within the area of the Commission's special competence and as to which we could hardly be aided by further examination of the record by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.437" offset="7345089">Now, that is putting to the Commission the responsibility for making the determination initially had the Third Circuit then of the opinion that the Commission did not make the requisite findings that it should have made and that its expertise had not been applied, then it should have remanded the case to the Commission for a further examination either on that record or on a -- on an additional record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.469" offset="7457207">But the Third Circuit goes out and the examine this merely on the law of contracts and in its analysis, it reads this language that I read to you from the Shell escalation in paragraph 3, and reads that merely as saying that it was a contract where there's a new weren't old, that calls for a higher price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.451" offset="7545187">Then the Shell price automatically goes up and we don't think the words "enter into a contract for the purchase of gas" can be so construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.017" offset="7591476">There's -- there's another case which is -- is really just as -- as significant as that Memphis case and -- and might refer to that and that's the Western Pacific case in 352 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.892" offset="7658977">Because in there, the -- the -- this Court very definitely held that the -- it was for the Interstate Commerce Commission first, that they first pass on a construction of the tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.351" offset="7708818">In another case which is somewhat like that, the Far Eastern Conference case and we refer the both of these in our -- our brief, this Court referred to the fact that in the development of administrative law, Chief Justice White, in the words of Mr. Justice Frankfurter, applied the accommodating complimentary roles of the Court in the -- and the administrative agencies in the enforcement of law to a situation where on the face of the statute, concurrent jurisdiction was conferred both on the courts and on the -- the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
