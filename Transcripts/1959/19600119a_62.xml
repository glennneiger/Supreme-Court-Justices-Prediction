            <text syncTime="28.545" offset="217527">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.458" offset="229230">This case is here on direct appeal by both parties from judgments of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.922" offset="275101">This is a case that was brought under the antitrust laws charging violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, Section 3 of the Sherman Act, Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.069" offset="339675">The court below held that agricultural cooperatives, which the defendant established it was, are exempt from prosecution under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, were not acting in combination with outsiders by virtue of the provisions of Section 6 of the Clayton Act and Sections 1 and 2 of the Capper-Volstead Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.953" offset="443225">The Government is appealing from this decision, in this judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.554" offset="465586">The Court also held that the cooperative was not exempt when it acquires a retail dairy, where the effect of the acquisition is to restrain trade in violation of Section 3 of the Sherman Act or to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, from this judgment, the association appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.410" offset="585017">The Government also appeals from this judgment on the issue of adequacy of the relief that was granted by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.329" offset="632665">The issue that is central to both appeals is not whether, but to the extent -- but the extent to which agricultural cooperatives are exempt from the normal operations of the antitrust laws by virtue of the provisions of the Clayton and Capper-Volstead Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.056" offset="731617">Now, there's no dispute between the parties that there is some exemptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.160" offset="760038">Some exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.674" offset="770069">The Government in its main brief concedes that agricultural cooperatives were given a limited immunity from Section 2 of the Sherman Act, namely, the right to obtain a monopoly in the colloquial sense and I'm quoting, “Of controlling the entire source of supply in a particular area.”</text>
            <text syncTime="191.427" offset="869125">The Government also concedes that the act from this, an agricultural association to obtain a degree of control over supply, which in the case of ordinary corporations, might constitute unlawful monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.820" offset="942686">Further, in its reply brief, the Government states that it has not asserted that a cooperative by the mere possession of monopoly market power transcends any Capper-Volstead authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.819" offset="1014680">The Government's position, as stated in its question presented, is whether monopolization or attempted monopolization by coercive and exclusionary means are immunized.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.244" offset="1072358">It's the association's position, on the other hand, that the cooperative has complete immunization from antitrust prosecution, say it in two circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.335" offset="1124707">One, where it combines with nonexempt -- combines or conspires with nonexempt outsiders for the benefit of the nonexempt outsiders as was the case in Borden, and two, where the monopolization results in undue enhancement of prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.636" offset="1213942">In that case, a special procedure is set up whereby the Secretary of Agriculture makes findings of fact, considers the question of monopolization and undue enhancement and authorizes and -- and orders the association to desist from such monopolization or restraint of trade.</text>

            <text syncTime="859.198" offset="3540198">Then they go on to say that you cannot use that supply control position and cannot maintain that supply control position by engaging in practices which they assert are predatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="877.531" offset="3613445">If you can have a monopoly, which they admit, and you refuse to deal with somebody, that's a coercive practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.977" offset="3651271">That's a predatory practice, but does that mean that the -- that a person with a monopoly can't -- can't do -- can't refuse to do business with someone when they are -- when -- when the monopoly is authorized, even -- even if the person whom -- whom they refused to sell, refuses to pay the price asked by the association and which the Secretary of Agriculture has not said is unduly enhanced.</text>

            <text syncTime="915.916" offset="3767045">That you can't say that something is coercive or predatory and therefore, it is not immunized, and at something else which is a monopoly, which they concede that an association can have in which a business corporation can't have is not immunized, because they put the catchphrase or the antitrust cliché, predatory or coercive against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.391" offset="3864952">And I -- and we submit, Your Honors, that -- that the legislative history of the Capper-Volstead Act is so overwhelming on these point that -- that it -- it defy -- it defies contradiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.339" offset="3920750">I think the best way to -- to refer to the legislative history is -- is not to say -- not even to refer to what was said when the Act was being passed, but just what was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.458" offset="3981249">When the bill was introduced in the House in the 66th Congress, it was -- it was introduced in substantially the same form as it now stands, some modification which I will get to later.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.819" offset="4046660">And it passed the House in that form and all of the -- well, I will get -- when it went to the Senate, an amendment was proposed by the Senate Judiciary Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.154" offset="4107995">And the Senate Judiciary Committee proposed that instead of the Secretary of Agriculture in Section 2, that the Federal Trade Commission be substituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.788" offset="4158568">And also that an antimonopoly amendment be added to Section 2 and that amended -- and that amendment reads as follows, “Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the creation of or attempt to create a monopoly or to exempt any association organized herein under from any proceeding instituted under the act entitle, an act to supplement existing law against unlawful restraints and monopolies and for other services approved on October 15, 1914 on account of unfair methods of competition in commerce.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.705" offset="4334216">That or those two amendments were adopted by the Senate in the 66th Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.733" offset="4362324">And the House refused to go along, so the bill came up again in the 67th Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.991" offset="4395342">And it was reintroduced in substantially the same form that it had been introduced by Congressman Volstead who was Chairman of Judiciary Committee in the 66th Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.952" offset="4439228">There was one change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.011" offset="4447378">And he left out a provision, any law to the contrary notwithstanding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1097.416" offset="4493040">The Senate reported the bill out again and yet omitted present Section 2, but it put the Walsh antimonopoly in them, with which I just read to you in the bill as an amendment to Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.366" offset="4564825">And there was very, very vigorous debate in the Senate on whether or not the Walsh antimonopoly amendment should be adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.633" offset="4609860">And it was overwhelmingly defeated by a vote of 56 to 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.516" offset="4637445">The bill then returned to the House and it became law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.978" offset="4667329">But the debates -- and there, I submit is -- is proof conclusive that the Senate and the House were both aware of the monopoly problems here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.922" offset="4731068">And they deliberately and overwhelmingly defeated a provision saying that monopolies were to be prohibited under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.765" offset="4790418">But if you go to the debates in this Congress and you find out why this bill was introduced, why this -- why was this legislation needed?</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.422" offset="4821034">Why did -- why did the farmers think they needed a legislation of this kind?</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.642" offset="4849977">And of it, the debate show conclusively that it was the purpose of this legislation that get the farmers out of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.994" offset="4891355">But the -- the Clayton Act, Section 6 had been passed which as Your Honors will recall, is the provision which exempts the labor organizations and cooperatives from the operation -- from -- from the -- their existence from the operation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.675" offset="4966066">After that Act was passed, prosecutions against farmer cooperatives continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.201" offset="5008175">There was the King case in Massachusetts where the farmers were indicted for refusing to sell potatoes to people who wouldn't pay the right price for it, the price that they fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.143" offset="5067943">They were indicted for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.885" offset="5074944">No, there were no claims that there was any undue enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.653" offset="5086020">They were just boycotting the purchases of potatoes, a predatory practice under the Government's definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.070" offset="5127607">But because of cases like that, the farmers asked Congress for additional protection and the debates are replete with statements that the purpose of the Capper-Volstead Act was to keep the farmers out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.733" offset="5198346">That the Secretary of Agriculture, if a break was needed so far as farmers were concerned, the Secretary of Agriculture was the man to supervise their conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.904" offset="5263026">Of course, the debates made clear that the -- that the farmers were not to be immunized from the antitrust laws when they conspired with outsiders for the benefit of the outsiders, but where the farmer acted alone, he couldn't monopolize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.810" offset="5358634">And it's a congressman ethics -- there was never any dispute during the course of the debates as to the meaning of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.202" offset="5396146">The dispute was just to the desirability of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.121" offset="5407848">Everybody recognized that this legislation would exempt farmers from the antitrust laws, except in the two cases or the two instances that I mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.150" offset="5451943">And the opponents of the bill were against it, because they didn't think that the -- the farmers should be immunized from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.184" offset="5492067">And Senator King, when the debates were -- when the -- when the bill was being debated in the Senate said that -- as -- as the proponents of the legislation, if they realized that if this legislation was passed without the so-called Walsh amendment, which I referred to, that this could result in monopolies so oppressive and so gigantic that if -- that no one would want to approve of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.931" offset="5647130">And the Senate, in the face of those statements, rejected the Walsh antimonopoly amendment by an overwhelming margin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.377" offset="5692897">We have in our brief, digested the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.968" offset="5727274">We have gone to considerable length in trying to make it -- I digest, just as fair as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.806" offset="5770637">It would be a waste of the Court's time at this time to try to cover these debates, but I think the -- the conclusion is -- is inescapable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.221" offset="5832286">That Congress knew exactly what it was doing, that what Congress intended to do was to keep the farmers out of court, and that if the Government's prosecution in this case is upheld, the will of Congress will be defeated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.551" offset="6925563">And that was what was held to be unlawful, the acquisition of Embassy Dairy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.452" offset="6945207">In the original complaint, in the charge for a violation under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the acquisition of Embassy Dairy was particularized as a means of unlawful monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.044" offset="7019499">That was held by the court below to be lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.968" offset="7039248">Then they charged that the acquisition of Embassy Dairy was a contract in restraint of trade and therefore, in violation of Section 3 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.460" offset="7089194">They also charged Section 1 of the Sherman Act that that has dropped out of the picture between the District Court and here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.437" offset="7121168">They further charged the acquisition of Embassy Dairy as a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act and that it substantially lessened competition to intend to decree a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.084" offset="7167666">Subsequently, they amended the complaint insofar as the Section 3 charge is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.293" offset="7196505">And they said that instead of being a contract in restraint of trade, the Embassy acquisition became a conspiracy in restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.454" offset="7237151">In fact, beginning in April, 1954 which was about a month before we acquired Embassy, we conspired with certain people in -- to -- to restrain trade in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.715" offset="7298278">The people with whom we are alleged to have conspired are the contracting parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.432" offset="7321057">At the trial, the Government adduced no evidence that the transaction of sale was for the benefit of -- for the competitive benefit of the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.053" offset="7387617">And the Court made no such finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.079" offset="7395662">The Court didn't find that a contract combination or conspiracy -- he founded a transaction of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.540" offset="7429517">Now, I think I should say this, that we don't contend that if the antitrust laws are applicable to the association, that these acts do not violate Section 3 or Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.983" offset="7499316">We are not urging as a factual matter that this -- this contract of acquisition doesn't restrain trade or it doesn't substantially lessen competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.134" offset="7543933">Our primary and I would say our sole defense is that Congress said that when an association not acting in concert with others for the benefit of the others, is not to be hold in a court by the Attorney General to determine whether its act of monopolization illicit or elicit, even though under ordinary antitrust statutes, no acts of monopolization elicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.813" offset="7706624">And let the courts determine on the complaint of the Attorney General whether a particular transaction is a lawful act of monopoly or an unlawful act of monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.129" offset="7763884">That the Congress said, “We'll take our chances here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.587" offset="7781752">The agrarian economy, the -- the agricultural economy is different from the -- from the industrial economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.711" offset="7810173">And the antitrust laws aren't suited to the -- the -- to the -- to the industry -- to the agricultural economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.945" offset="7835146">So we will put these farmers, unless they conspire with outsiders, in the hands of the Secretary of Agriculture, the man who knows them best.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.006" offset="7871404">And if they unduly enhance prices, he can crack down on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.629" offset="7889899">And if they don't -- if they don't comply with the -- with the order of the Secretary of Agriculture, then let the Attorney General come in and then let the Attorney General bring the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.619" offset="7945801">And the Attorney General commented that time, bring his action against restraint or trade, monopolization or anything that he wants to bring into this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2030.480" offset="8225311">Now, you can't read their briefs without coming to the conclusion that they conceive that if a contract is for the financial benefit of the association, even though it may restrain trade, that they cannot proceed, but I submit, Your Honor, that that completely -- if you adopted the test to that kind, you would completely frustrate the intention of Congress because you're putting the cooperative right back in the courts again.</text>

            <text syncTime="4056.945" offset="16331107">It was also clear that the members could not be proceeded against for lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof, but it was not clear what was a legitimate object of an agricultural cooperative and because the Section 6 of the Clayton Act did not apply to cooperatives having capital stock and because it wasn't clear that a cooperative could be formed for the purpose of establishing a single marketing agency for the single price for all the members who -- for all the farmers who were -- who joined that cooperative, since an agreement to fix prices would -- would be a violation of the antitrust laws, the impetus came for the enactment of the Capper-Volstead Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.042" offset="16555551">And it's -- it's -- there's question, no question at all that the -- that that Act of 1922 served a -- a very valuable purpose so far as Congress was concerned in removing doubts as to the legality of the existence of these foreign cooperatives and removing doubts as to the extent to which they could eliminate price competition among the members of the cooperative in dealing with large processors and large middlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.609" offset="16693791">And the -- the gist of -- of the Government's position in this case is that the Capper-Volstead authorization does not go so far as to permit a cooperative which has obtained a dominant position in the market to use that position for the purpose of driving out the competition of independent farmers who decided not to join the cooperative or to join some other cooperatives.</text>
