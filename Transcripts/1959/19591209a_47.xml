            <label>Mr. Seymour B. Goldman</label>
            <text syncTime="9.735" offset="142294">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.655" offset="173955">In my argument yesterday, I started by saying that we, in our petition and in our brief had contended that the sentencing on to two consecutive sentences constituted double jeopardy and we also argued the questions of the interpretation of a statute and the application of lenity in the interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.916" offset="307075">I stated at that time and I repeat today that I do not propose in my argument to stress those points, they having been very amply argued by counsel in two very recent cases and the Court having ruled upon those two arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.162" offset="376038">I distinguish the Yancy case from the two cases, the Gore case and the Harris case which were recently before the Court in one significant particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.030" offset="439463">That fact is that in the Yancy case only one section of the statute was set forth in the information upon which the two counts were founded and upon which Mr. Yancy was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.565" offset="529638">In support of a claim of error by the trial court, I refer first to the findings of facts and conclusions of law and the order overruling the motion to correct the sentence which is on page 16 of the transcript of the record in which the trial court held, it is further held that the Court has within it its discretion the right to impose two or more sentences on separate counts and in an indictment or information and have been run consecutively and the Court cites as its authority the Blockburger versus United States, 284 U.S. 299.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.664" offset="734020">The Court of Appeals in affirming the decision of the District Court also relied upon the Blockburger case and cited the Blockburger case as its authority for having to sustain or affirm the order of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.353" offset="836733">On page 23 and 22 of the transcript of the record, Mr. Justice Stewart, in his opinion set forth in denying this branch of the motion, the District Court didn't no more than follow a broken line of judicial authority and again commences with Blockburger versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.367" offset="964838">The Blockburger case, it is our contention, did not provide a basis of authority for sustaining the decision of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.659" offset="1034010">Where in the Blockburger case and the Gore case, the Harris case, and every case that I have found, that has come before this Court and its consideration more than one section of the statute has been cited as the -- the basis for the information or the indictment in which ever case it was and for the consecutive sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.797" offset="1154591">The Blockburger case itself arose from separate statutes and they were set forth in separate statutes and I feel that the pertinent language on page 304 of the Blockburger case, which sets forth its rule, is that the applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.236" offset="1304325">And I stress the language of a violation of two distinct statutory provisions which is not the fact in the instant case.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="309.313" offset="1340583">Now, if there had been a separate section on the sale and a separate section on the purchase, am I to infer you wouldn't be here?</text>

            <text syncTime="319.255" offset="1380394">After the Gore decision and after the Harris decision, I don't believe that I would be here renewing the same arguments which they made.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.609" offset="1425847">That was the conten -- my original contention I frankly admit was that no matter whether they cited separate sections of the statute that this constituted double punishment or double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.240" offset="1492302">In view of the recent decisions of the Court, I cannot maintain that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.857" offset="1514768">I feel that that is -- I may respectfully disagree with that position, but that is the law and it has been stated very clearly after exhaustive argument by counsel and examination by the Court that that is the law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Seymour B. Goldman</label>
            <text syncTime="387.378" offset="1652903">That at the time that the statute was passed, this was considered as one crime, the various elements that were named were all parts of one crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.475" offset="1705253">They did not arise as the separate sections that the statute did from different historical precedence, tax problems, importation problems, and controls of criminal acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.285" offset="1760528">This particular section, I think it is similar to crimes of violence that we have where the man maybe charged with committing a felonious act with the use of a dangerous weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.069" offset="1823640">Under our state laws where they list various forms of weapons that he might use in the statute yet upon conviction of making a deadly assault with a gun and a knife and poison, I think that upon the same instance whether there's only one act, there would only be one conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.394" offset="1916949">The prosecution might have different channels to approach that one conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.718" offset="1942235">In this instance, it being one section of a statute subsequently separated, there are separated -- subsequently separated into distinct sections to the statute that there was only one criminal act permitted although they separated into counts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1110.354" offset="4544763">Before approaching the formal part of my argument perhaps it would be well for me to answer some of the questions that have been raised on the petitioner's argument and the first one, I think was asked by Mr. Justice Brennan yesterday, as to whether a person could be convicted under this statute of four separate offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.351" offset="4652805">I think that he could be, if there were separate evidence of each of the activities proscribed by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.808" offset="4686555">There seems to be no reason either in law or logic why that could not be so?</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.509" offset="4713409">And so in this case, we contend that it was entirely proper for the petitioner to be charged and convicted and successively punished for separate and distinct violations of this particular statute, which prohibits purchase as well as sale, I might say two diametrically opposed activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.052" offset="4827617">Whatever maybe said concerning the ambiguity that might exist with respect to the other provisions of the statute dispensing and distribution and sale, there is certainly no occasion to confuse purchase with sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="1672.744" offset="6794324">Certainly, they used inept language to -- to define a single offense when they said purchase, sale, dispense, and distribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.187" offset="6836120">In fact, I believe it was in the Nigro case that that contention was raised and this Court said, “It would seem to be admissible and wise in a law seeking to impose taxes for the sale of an illusive subject to require conformity to a prescribed method of sale and delivery calculated to disclose or make more difficult any escape from the tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1783.066" offset="7235688">In both the Albrecht case which punished possession of liquor and sale of the same liquor which had been possessed, both of those offenses were laid under the National Prohibition Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.638" offset="7369958">Now, the question has been raised as to whether the statute has been broken down since its original enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.380" offset="7404857">This statute was originally enacted as part of the Revenue Act of 1918, it became effective in 1919.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.999" offset="7435368">It was an amendment to the Harrison Narcotic Act which had been enacted in 1914.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.496" offset="7469328">The Harrison Narcotic Act as Blockburger points out, had its separate penalty section and this was -- this format was continued through the reenactment of the statute which I suggest to the Court was intended to affect -- each reenactment was intended to affect no substantive change than the effect of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.510" offset="7581445">In Blockburger, the petitioner contended that the all inclusive penal section of that Act “any person who violates or fails to comply with any of the requirements of this Act” is to be construed as imposing a single punishment for the distinct requirements of the separate provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.077" offset="7671724">The Court said, “The plain meaning of the provision is that each offense is subject to the penalty proscribed and if that be too harsh, the remedy must be afforded by act of Congress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.664" offset="7730030">The separate penalty provision was continued in Section 2557 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.347" offset="7772766">It's now contained in an enlarged form, elaborate form, in Section 7237 under the 1954 Act, which of course, under our modern device of -- of enacting legislation, of separating the substantive offenses in one section of the Act, the penalty section and in another is wholly consistent, but I do not think it can be interpreted as intending to impose only a single punishment for all violations committed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2040.883" offset="8266898">Now, the case comes up on 2255 motion and I will not belabor with the Court with the intimate history of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.241" offset="8308381">Suffice it to say, I think, that we have here a legal question as to whether under this statute separate offenses of purchase and sale are defined by this enactment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2084.685" offset="8442128">And an example of this is the Blockburger case where a sale was held violative of 2553 (a), the present statute and 2554 (a) which is selling without a written order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.641" offset="8537945">King against United States in 280 U.S. affirming 31 F.2d at page 17 under authority of Albrecht held that selling morphine not in or from this original stamp package and shipping the same morphine in interstate commerce were different offenses and I might note there that it was held in a case which involved successive trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.202" offset="8652152">Pinkerton against United States of course held that conspiracy and the substant -- substantive offense which is the objective of the conspiracy are separate and distinct offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.090" offset="13659721">The defendant -- the next category, I might point out, is whether defendant engaged in several successive transactions of the same kind contrary to a single statutory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.265" offset="13708413">And an example of that is in Ebeling against Morgan, 237 U.S. cutting six mail bags in the course of a single transaction, In Re Henry 123 U.S. mailing several letters in furtherance of the scheme to defraud and of course Blockburger which involved two successive sales on different days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.670" offset="13810082">Now, the next category is whether defendant engages in a single transaction and thereby violates several different provisions of a single statute and the leading case on that is Albrecht which said that possession of liquor and sale of the same liquor all in violation of the single statute for two different offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.990" offset="13911333">Burton, I've already mentioned agreeing to receive compensation and receiving the same compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.704" offset="13942157">The next category would be whether defendant engages in several different acts and thereby violates several different provisions of the same statute and I suggest to the Court that the Michener case, counterfeiting case in 331 U.S. 789, forging a plate adopted for counterfeiting to be made and in possession of that plate where separate offenses held to be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.015" offset="14055424">I believe that this case falls in this last mentioned category where the defendant has committed more than one act in violation of the single statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.042" offset="14103489">Now, we must be careful to distinguish cases in which the defendant engages in a course of conduct such as in U.S. against Universal CIT Corporation where the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act were interpreted as proscribing a course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.984" offset="14183320">However, it should be noted that the Court was careful to find out that different kinds or classifications of conduct, for instance, under payment would be one offense, false record keeping would be another offense even under that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.150" offset="14255940">Another case, another classification which we should be careful to distinguish consists of the case in which one offense merges with another of greater culpability as in the Prince case, entering into a bank with intent to commit robbery and committing robbery therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.110" offset="14331800">And with reference to that, I -- I would like to make a point that we have no occasion to consider the question of intent in -- in connection with the narcotic statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.383" offset="14380910">It's been held by this Court in Balint against United States that these are strictly malum prohibitum offense as not involving willfulness or intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3607.898" offset="14534928">This Court held that with respect to the successive sales, they constituted separate acts, separate offenses because they stem from separate impulses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.907" offset="14586964">With respect to the question of whether the same sale on the second day constituted two offenses under different statutes, this Court, of course, held that they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.988" offset="14651329">Gore came before the Court and involved, as I've indicated, a single sale in violation of three separate statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.296" offset="14704515">This Court reaffirmed the principle of Blockburger, said that the legislative enactment in the narcotics field revealed a determination by Congress to turn the screw of the criminal machinery detection, prosecution, and punishment tighter and tighter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.658" offset="14774000">It distinguished these other cases, Bell, on the basis that lenity was applied there and there's no implication for its application in the narcotics field.</text>

            <text syncTime="3695.647" offset="14885909">The Court also held that there was no double jeopardy and indicated that to accept the petitioner's contention with respect to that principle would involve the overruling of a long line of cases involving that question Carter against McGlowry, Morgan against Divine, Albrecht, Pinkerton, American Tobacco, U.S. against Michener, and (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.163" offset="15000012">The Court finally said that the issue was one at phenology and not most tantalizing aspect of it the apportionment of proper punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.784" offset="15042539">Court noted that this Court has no authority to provide sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.106" offset="15063751">Harris came before this Court at the previous term and involved the single transaction violative -- violative of two separate statutory provisions, Section 174 Title 21 and the present statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.418" offset="15136998">The charges were a purchase from an -- unstamped package and receiving and concealed unlawfully imported narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.608" offset="15169808">The petitioner's contention there was identical with the contention in this one in this case that the same evidence rule of the Blockburger case required that the Court interpret defendant's conduct as constituting only a single offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.477" offset="15253295">Court said that the violations as distinguished from the direct evidence offered to prove them was distinctly different under each statute and the Court emphasized that it is the element of the statutory offenses that defines the crime and determines whether what act will constitute more than one offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.031" offset="15347545">Here of course, I don't think that there's any room for doubt that purchase and sale constitute separate elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.296" offset="15392580">As I've indicated before, the offenses here involved diametrically opposed acts, each requiring its own separate impulse, enterprise and participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.712" offset="15450258">It's been noted that we have separate proof of the sale, so that we did not rely on the same evidence if that's the -- the interpretation of the Blockburger rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.891" offset="15498951">We certainly have different elements, and if that is the interpretation and -- and I may say that -- that Blockburger has been bended about quite a bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.586" offset="15537716">The rule of Blockburger has been, I think, stated only partially time and time again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.969" offset="15571257">The usual quote is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.429" offset="15585050">The applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.473" offset="15649311">Eliminated from that quote, is the sentence which precedes it, and I will quote, “Each of the offenses created requires proof of a different element”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.049" offset="15699571">So, it is even under Blockburger, it is the element of the offense rather than the primary evidence necessary to prove those elements that's important.</text>
