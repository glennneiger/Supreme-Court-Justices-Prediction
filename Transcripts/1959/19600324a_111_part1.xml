            <text syncTime="310.005" offset="1343404">Now, the posture of the case when the conspiracy count was found out to be -- does not worth the paper it was written on, is that you have three respondents who didn't know each other, has nothing to do with each other, and yet their case had to go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.977" offset="1415293">That is when I say how to go to the jury as the trial court felt that because he could admonish in cautionary -- within cautionary instruction for the jury that there wouldn't be prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="605.979" offset="2527274">In the brief, I stated the Canella case which is 157 F.2d, which concerns itself with the motion for new trial due to prejudicial evidence, Kotteakos case, and I suppose that was a shorthand method of referring to the Court to the point that -- that he met -- he kept to unmake it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1812.560" offset="7353657">Well, that's so much for the -- the -- for the -- the first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.495" offset="7377377">It's fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.392" offset="7380929">It's basic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.983" offset="7395349">And -- and since the Government is now defending this on its merits, what might take place if such a -- a procedural gimmick is permitted is not too hard to visualize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.937" offset="7475075">Now it has nothing to do with good faith or bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.759" offset="7486360">The Government states that I don't -- I don't prove bad faith even the Court below said I -- I don't prove bad faith and I don't say it wasn't bad faith, but I say it just as an individual may be the subject of an illegal search, an illegal arrest that getting the -- an illegal detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.990" offset="7567339">The Government has to have a -- a high moral standard when it comes to -- to the administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.974" offset="7595238">They can't use evidence that they get in a bad way and say “I beg your pardon, we didn't mean to do it in a bad way.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.604" offset="7633795">Well, now the second point is -- it really was my third point, but because the Government switched again in this case, it now becomes the second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.789" offset="7694503">Now at the trial -- at the trial level, the proposition was put forth by the Government and accepted by the trial judge that you can add separate and distinct transactions in order to arrive at the $5,000 valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.395" offset="7788962">The trial judge asked the District Attorney to prepare a charge based on that and a charge was so given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.904" offset="7823026">We ask that the case be submitted to the jury on this point only if there could be -- if they would be aggregated according specifically the to Andrew's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.241" offset="7880286">That was refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.821" offset="7886660">Now, at the Court of Appeal level, the Court of Appeals did not decide the issue of separate and distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.701" offset="7934203">They said it is not necessary because here we have a unity of purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.643" offset="7957922">Here, we have an agreement, which we deny there is, but therefore it's not necessary to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.388" offset="7992926">Now on our petition for certiorari -- and as matter of fact the petition for rehearing, we called attention of the Court to the Grunewald point, namely that you cannot convict an individual on a theory first put forth by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.095" offset="8067741">And here, it was particularly aggravating, because here, they're convicting us on a theory that we had asked to be submitted to the jury which was refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.664" offset="8102013">And the Court of Appeals said “We don't have to decide the other point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.564" offset="8125628">This is good enough.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.877" offset="8130853">So we say that under the Grunewald thing, there was no problem in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.252" offset="8152377">And I -- and the Government knows that because when they came here on the brief that they filed here on the merits, they now say they're not satisfied by saying the Court of Appeals is wrong the first time; they now say the Court of Appeals is wrong the second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.415" offset="8221027">It's the trial court that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.441" offset="8229177">They now say that separate transactions can be -- and this thing can be aggregated and -- and submitted to the jury, therefore, bypassing the Grunewald point, because if that is correct -- In other words, if you can charge a person in an indictment, add up $5,000 on a separate and distinct transactions, then Grunewald doesn't apply, because the Government has a right to come here and they certainly have tried and -- and put forth every possible reason to sustain the verdict but --</text>

            <text syncTime="2114.063" offset="8559574">And looking at the statute as I read it, and I must confess every time I read it and reread it and reread it, I -- I feel there's possibilities of other meanings none -- none of which fits in with the Government's interpretation of the statute, which is utterly farfetched and against our whole common law background of criminal law, against the decision in the Andrew's case which Congress was conscious of when they reenacted the statute and that -- and they cite no authority for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.083" offset="8719653">They say it and saying it the -- they live and go with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.832" offset="8742745">Now, what does the act -- how does the act read?</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.692" offset="8754134">The actual statute reads as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.720" offset="8786213">“Whoever transports 2314 in interstate or foreign commerce any goods where merchandise, securities, or money of the value of 5,000 or more.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.576" offset="8833651">Now, it doesn't read, whoever transports in one or more shipments, goods of $5,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.831" offset="8870745">The whole concept of criminal law is one act, one crime, two acts, two crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.338" offset="8896763">The only -- the only variation of that principle is that its found according to a conspiracy or single plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.221" offset="8928214">As a matter as fact, if there's a conspiracy to transport goods of more than $5,000 that doesn't even have to be a single shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.482" offset="8957262">Value has no place in the -- in the conspiracy angle just a mere conspiracy plus an overt act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.999" offset="8987355">Now, if there hadn't been the Andrew's case, if there hadn't been the discussion of the legislative history, if we were going according to the English system, whoever transports in interstate or foreign commerce goods of the value of $5,000, I would say that it refers to one transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.742" offset="9082337">Yes there's a definition of value. Value means the aggregate value of all goods, but some -- in the particular indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.836" offset="9114728">But to me, that takes care of the situation in case an individual takes various items in the same truckload.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.385" offset="9152867">In other words if someone steals stuff from a -- let's say a ladies dress shop comes forward with the fur coat, feels the fur coat is incomplete by itself and takes shoes, handbags, jewelry, he would not be in a position to say each item -- each item is less than 5,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.690" offset="9246177">That's what -- if there was no legislative history, I would take that as the -- as the -- the logical reading whoever transports goods in the value of $5,000 because the concept of retroactive criminal liability, the concept that you can take $10 now and a $1,000 now, in two years, another $1,000 and a year of $1,000 and does not necessary even come to same owner and that -- that just doesn't make sense, bearing in mind that's a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.371" offset="9384835">Bearing in mind that this is not only a criminal statute but that it's the type of criminal statute which isn't so necessary to protect our -- the Federal Government and the federal responsibilities, because this is a supplement to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.463" offset="9453275">Each one of these individual if they do something wrong can be punished by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.048" offset="9475532">This is not the type of conspiracy where they're stealing from the trains or where they're stealing from the -- from the platforms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.469" offset="9505207">We have -- we have a history where Justice Holmes in analyzing the Motor Vehicle Act stated that in his opinion, an airplane was not a -- a motor vehicle, and therefore, one could not be charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.527" offset="9585455">So, the -- the entire concept looking at the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.336" offset="9600711">Now going back to the legislative history, what do we find through these expressions?</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.298" offset="9628609">In the event that a defendant is charged in the same indictment with two or more violations of this Act, then the aggregate value of all goods shall constitute the value thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.724" offset="9674271">Now, I don't understand it, because two or more violations, how can it be a violation unless it's 5,000?</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.843" offset="9706768">So if we're going to adopt the -- the well known usage of Congressional English and say by violations they mean infractions, then I can reconcile it, but looking at it literally, two or more violations, they don't have to aggregate to get the $5,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="2450.847" offset="9906761">And as a matter of fact, I see I have the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.940" offset="9919091">I have the entire histories back there confining myself -- perhaps, I should skip from there to (a) 11 where I actually have the exact words of the -- of the people preparing the managers, preparing the -- that's (a) 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.771" offset="10014490">Section 5 of the present act provides that in the event -- in the event the defendant was charged with two or more violations the aggregated value of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.824" offset="10054719">Now the word “violations” can't mean what it normally means under those circumstances because one violation is good enough without the aggregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.222" offset="10096306">Now therefore it may well be that it means infractions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.326" offset="10108635">It may also well mean that there were several sections under the Act that required no moneys like stealing, transporting dyes or receiving with a value of $500.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.197" offset="10188152">Is it possible that it meant those particular sections?</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.442" offset="10205184">Well, in view of the legislative history, I -- I couldn't take that meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.412" offset="10221066">I took the meaning that based on other things stated in -- in the history namely, (a) 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.343" offset="10284701">Let's say I'll go to -- not so much of (a) 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.386" offset="10368920">There's another section here that they changed the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.590" offset="10381772">They now refer to “if a person is charged with a series of violations, then you can aggregate a series of transactions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.327" offset="10428688">Now under those circumstances, I took the meaning and I had it ready made for me that that Judge Parker did in the Andrew's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.908" offset="10474977">He said, “Where there's unity of purpose, where there's a conspiracy, where there's a plan, you can add up.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.595" offset="10505801">And that's been the law in all our States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.937" offset="10515101">I quoted two cases, one from California, one from New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.003" offset="10535372">I quoted the ALR in the reply brief which adds up thousands of cases and the whole philosophy has been in charging people with grand larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.379" offset="10572884">You can only charge him with grand larceny if you add up the little larcenies but only -- only if there's a -- if it's done pursuant to a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.965" offset="10607261">Now otherwise, without the plan, you -- you cannot add up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.543" offset="10629517">So this statute makes sense, punishes bad people who conspire to transport across the line goods in amount of more -- 5,000 or more even without them transporting $1, takes care of statute of limitations which otherwise would be very a difficult proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.413" offset="10744978">In other words, suppose someone in the first four years to $4,000 worth of stuff, stolen stuff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.831" offset="10778728">The sixth year, the seventh year, he takes $2,000 is there a crime committed?</text>
