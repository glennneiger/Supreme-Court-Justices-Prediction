            <text syncTime="51.030" offset="307493">This action originated in the District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee by the suit instituted by the Trustees of the Welfare and Retirement Fund of the United Mine Workers of America, seeking to collect or to obtain from this settlor of a trust, certain moneys that the settlor had retained, under our tradition, the amount of those moneys being $76,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.334" offset="432671">The defendant who was the -- which was the settlor of the trust, the Benedict Coal Corporation in an answer to the petition or the bill complaint as filed, took the position first that because of certain conditions which were expressed in the contract under which the trust was created, there could not be any liability, taking the position that the trustees were third party's beneficiaries, third-party beneficiaries to the trust agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.813" offset="566627">That there had been a breach of the trust agreement that or breach of the contract of which the trust agreement is a part, and that by the reason of the alleged breach there could be no recovery by the trustees for the funds or of the funds which were held by the settlor.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.141" offset="631933">The -- they also took the position, the defendant did, that it was entitled to a counterclaim for moneys which had heretofore been paid under the trust agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.104" offset="683760">That question is out of the case and we're no interested in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.545" offset="697553">It also filed a cross claim against the union, United Mine Workers of America, which was a party to the collective bargaining agreement and in the collective bargain agreement, the trust agreement is set forth.</text>

            <label>Mr. Russell R. Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="174.263" offset="800475">It has impleaded in the cross-claim and severed processes had upon it Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.858" offset="822836">And that impleading was done upon the basis of that claim was that under the Act which authorized, the Act of Congress which authorized the creation of this trust, there is a provision that a violation of the contract collective bargaining agreement gives a right of action and if they are asserting that they have a right of action against the union that is the settlor of the trust, the employer here, the coal operator and that they – the settlor has a right of action against the union because said the settlor, the coal operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.251" offset="988348">The union violated the agreement in that there were certain strikes occurred during the period of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.306" offset="1016560">And the right, the suit as it's instituted or the kind of cross action as instituted is based directly upon the federal statute or rights granted by the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.072" offset="1067656">The original action is based upon the jurisdiction of federal court is diversity of citizenship and the amount involved several Act of Congress is not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.284" offset="1112482">There was a trial of course for a jury and then the verdict has rendered by the jury, the jury found under the instructions of the trial judge that the settlor hold or had in possession $76,000 in round three years, a money that belonged to these trustees and that the trustees were entitled to have that and recover that money.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.141" offset="1239960">However, the court instructed the jury that it should also determine from the proof whether or not there had been a breach of this collective bargaining agreement by the union in that certain strikes had occurred which the Court said the jury could find were a violation of the contract and if the jury found that there were strikes which had occurred which were violative of the contract, the jury should ascertain the amount of damage that the company, the settlor, had suffered as a result of these illegal strikes, they found it to be illegal and the jury found that the amount of damage that the company had suffered was $81,000 in round figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.513" offset="1449462">So that the verdict to the jury as returned was that there is $76,000 due under the terms of the trust of the trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.825" offset="1478719">There's $81,000 due from the union as damages to the operator or the settlor who was also the settlor of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.345" offset="1520724">Upon that type of verdict, we made motion for the entry of a judgment then in accordance with the verdict, rendering judgment as we sought for the trustees for $76,000 plus interest from the day the institution of the action and on which execution could be awarded and that the $81,000 be rendered to the judgment against the union in favor of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.783" offset="1626467">The court declined to enter that judgment and the court said in substance and so entered its judgment that there should be a setoff of the $81,000 which the union, which was the amount of the verdict against the union and which the company was entitled to recover against the $76,000, which the trustees were entitled to recover, resulting of course that the judgment awarded in favor of the trustees under their trust was entirely wiped out, and that there would be an additional amount payable by the union of some $4,000 or $5,000 to the company, the settlor of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.266" offset="1788426">That is the real question in this lawsuit as it goes on through and it is the question before Your Honors today.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.658" offset="1814026">Now it is our position first of course that there was no illegal strike and that there were no damages which of course have been recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.549" offset="1849553">That part of this case I do not want to argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.335" offset="1860733">Counsel representing any other action which represents United Mine Workers of America will present that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.368" offset="1884871">But it is our position, it was our position in the Court of Appeals that this -- the trustees are not third party beneficiaries of this contract, but they are trustees of a trust and that this $76,000 is trust fund that we are entitled to this trust fund and that our right to that trust fund cannot be defeated by setoff or some other action where the union is liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.725" offset="2018304">We say that this contract itself created a trust, the raise of which is vested and the right to own and hold it is vested in the trustees and then it makes no difference while we do not think that there was a breech of this contract and if any liability arose for damages and that will be presented to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.511" offset="2101373">But we take the position that even if there were a violation of the contract, collective bargaining agreement, if there was an illegal strike, and incidentally the so-called illegal strikes in number of this case appears in Court lasted to a day or day and a half to two or three days, there were short period durations that work on damages only and the jury found $81,000 in damages float from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.393" offset="2180995">Incidentally to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit however found that the major damage is used and the trial court was entirely erroneous and remanded the case for a re-determination of the amount of damages that could be awarded for those, for that so-called breach of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.548" offset="2249540">Now I'm not interested in that phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.807" offset="2254555">I would accept that if the evidence is the same on any retrial if there'd be a retrial, the amount of damage recoverable for the breach of the contract could only be $15,000 and we would recover part of our money because the setoff wouldn't wipe it all out if you understand what I'm driving at.</text>

            <label>Mr. Russell R. Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="565.004" offset="2363434">Well, not entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.774" offset="2374510">It could have a result of not -- this question not being important, but it has another result may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.741" offset="2414320">In the pleadings as filed and in the case as tried and as affirmed in the Court of Appeals, it is not necessary for the settlor of the trust or the employer to do what they did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.699" offset="2470118">All they need to do to defeat our right of action is to prove that there was a violation of the trust that they suffered damages, they not -- need not inter plead the union as a third party defendant here and simply defeat our recovery by approving that there was an illegal strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.991" offset="2547336">Now it is true Your Honor that if there were no damages which could be recovered in this case, then there would be no sum to setoff against our claim, but we think this question goes deeper than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.939" offset="2603133">That the very principle is involved and which is determinative and is a vital importance to trusts of this type, of which there are many, many and thousands, hundreds of thousands of people are beneficiaries of such trust which are in effect charitable trusts, that it goes further than just the narrow proposition here that they might not be entitled to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.755" offset="2682441">That the proposition that's squarely before Your Honors, today is, is there a right of setoff?</text>
            <text syncTime="651.815" offset="2710653">Now it's true that in this case if they could not recover, if the settlor could not recover that is against the union, no damages could be awarded, they would have nothing to set off against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.246" offset="2752345">To that extent the other would be determined, but we do not think its determinative or the question on which Your Honors granted the writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.792" offset="2786513">The broad question which Your Honors granted the writ of certiorari is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.917" offset="2803022">Can -- is it proper even if the union is entitled, is test in damages, is it proper to have a setoff?</text>
            <text syncTime="688.022" offset="2855476">The real reason that that maybe material if I'm going to regress a moment again, in every action wherein the trust brings a suit to collect this raise in the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.560" offset="2909602">It will be possible if this Court does not pass upon this question which we think if squarely before it for the company, the settlor, the employer to raise this question that there was a breach of contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="871.133" offset="3587950">That is correct, it's the ultimate answer, but may it please your honor the position is taken by the defendants here that if they have to maintain this action as third-party beneficiaries any defense that could be made by the prime parties of the contract, the union can -- I mean yes can be made as against the beneficiaries and against the trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.886" offset="3694947">And we say if they sue straight as trustees and their right of action is as trustees and not as third-party beneficiaries, it makes no difference what kind of action might be maintained as between the union and the coal operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.283" offset="3760462">In other words what does this contract, another section of this collective bargaining agreement, may it please the Court contains the provision, certain provisions with reference to settlement of disputes and certain procedures shall be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.816" offset="3818663">Now it is the position that I don't want to argue that question but it is the position of the defendants Your Honor that this, there were disputes between the union and the man, the miner.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.563" offset="3865579">That those disputes were not settled under the collective bargaining provisions and that when they were not settled there was a breach of the contract and I don't think there was, but there was a breach of the contract and therefore that any rights that my clients had in this case are subservient to determination of whether or not that breach of the contract resulted in damages to the operator and therefore if it did such damages maybe set-off against our claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1489.454" offset="6061223">So that the title to this 30 cents a ton, although the money remains in the hands of the employer, is not his money, it's nobody's money but ours.</text>

            <text syncTime="1577.134" offset="6411891">On every ton this 30 cents comes into being as our money and it's that type of constructive trust, this is not an old fashioned garden variety trust that we knew about in school boy days.</text>

            <text syncTime="2610.495" offset="10545403">Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.996" offset="10563375">Upon complaint that the United Mine Workers of America and the District 28 of the United Mine Workers have violated the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreements 1950 and 1952 by reason of pertinent strikes, the District Court entered a judgment upon a jury verdict against the union for a sum in excess of $81,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.551" offset="10689599">The Agreement did not contain any express no-strike clause or any other expressive waver or restriction or limitation upon that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.998" offset="10755323">The agreements, however, did cancel previous no-strike clauses contained in prior contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.231" offset="10800253">The agreements also contained grievance machinery procedure and in each of the strike situations involved when District 28 represented these were called concerning stoppages, the grievances were settled and the miners returned to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.248" offset="10900355">In both of the lower courts, the unions contended that the agreements had preserved the right to strike without restriction or limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.810" offset="10942568">Both Courts rejected this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.129" offset="10963884">And the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court on the issue of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.310" offset="11000560">But because of errors relating to damages, it remanded the case solely for re-determination of the amount of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.192" offset="11052178">Petitioners sought a writ of certiorari to that judgment on numerous points, but this Court granted cert limited, however, to the question of whether a stoppage of work, pending supplement of the dispute comestible under the grievance machinery procedures of the 1950 contract is proscribed by that agreement so as to subject the two unions, the mine workers in District 28 the damage actions under Taft-Hartley Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.047" offset="11215600">Now, if Your Honors please, the history of collective bargaining in the Bituminous Coal Industry in this country shows that prior to the year 1947 when the Taft-Hartley Act was enacted, providing for damage actions against labor unions for breach of contracts the prior agreements preceding 1947 contained express waivers of the right to strike and express prohibitions against the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.276" offset="11424475">The 1941 and 1945 agreements for example as found on page 125-A of the printed record provided that a strike or stoppage of work on part of the mine workers shall be a violation of this Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.438" offset="11513083">It provided that for the duration of the Agreement no strikes shall be called or maintained hereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.105" offset="11547773">It provided also that under no circumstances shall the operator discuss the matter under dispute with the mine committee or any representative of the United Mine Workers of America during suspension of work in violation of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.753" offset="11610363">And I want particularly Your Honors to direct your attention to the language found in the 1941 Agreement which was carried forward into the 1945 Agreement and it is found and I emphasize that it is found under the settlement of dispute section and it says and I read from the record, printed record page 124-A pending the hearing of disputes, the mine workers shall not cease work because of any dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.192" offset="11776188">Now in 1947 with the enactment of the Taft-Hartley Act with this Section 301 imposing civil sanctions upon labor unions for breach of contract the United Mine Workers was no longer willing to subject itself to a damage action by reason of any provision in the contract which prohibited the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.335" offset="11936684">It provided for example that the earlier contracts were to be carried forward, but it provided specifically that the no-strike covenants of the preceding contracts were rendered null and void and abrogated and cancelled.</text>

            <text syncTime="2994.824" offset="12082657">I now read from page 129-A of the record, any and all provisions in either the Appalachian Joint Wage Agreement of July 19, 1941 or the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of April 11, 1945 containing any no-strike or penalty clause or clauses or any clause denominated the illegal suspension of work are hereby rescinded, cancelled, abrogated and made null and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.491" offset="12209298">Now in the same contract and under subsection three of the same Section which is headed miscellaneous, the contracting parties agree that as a part of the consideration of this contract, any and all disputes, stoppages, suspensions of work and any and all claims, demands or actions going there from or involve therein shall be by the contracting parties settled and determined exclusively by the machinery provided in the settlement of local and district dispute section of this agreement or if national in character by the poor use of free collective bargaining as heretofore known the practice in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.475" offset="12393305">The 1948 contract carried forward the 1947 Agreement and in 1950 the same provisions were carried forward but there was added to the 1950 contract, subsection (4) of the miscellaneous section which provided that both the United Mine Workers of America and the operators affirmed their intention to maintain the integrity of this contract and to exercise their best efforts to available disciplinary measures to prevent stoppages of work by strike or lockup pending adjustment or adjudication of disputes and grievances in the manner provided in this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.813" offset="12578670">The Sixth Circuit declared that the agreement expressly stated that the no-strike provisions of the previous contracts were superseded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.366" offset="12636871">They admitted that, but it declared that the question of whether or not the strikes violated the contract depended upon what affect the agreement to settle all local disputes in accordance with the settlement of local and disputes district disputes procedures had upon the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.687" offset="12742092">It concluded that a strike to settle a dispute which a collective bargaining agreement provides shall be settled by an exclusive and obligatory alternative procedure constitutes a violation of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.680" offset="12826102">Now it said that if that did not render meaningless the express abrogation of the no-strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.176" offset="12876048">But it said that the right to strike was preserved with respect to all disputes not subject to settlement by other methods made exclusive by the agreements and though it professed that the unions remain free from liability for spontaneous or wild cat strike which they defined as the kind of stoppages and suspensions of work which the agreement made subject to the settlement procedure, it concluded that the particular strikes which are involved here resulted from localized labor disputes which were cognizable under the grievance machinery, and therefore, the unions were liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.945" offset="13083146">Now it's the position of the unions that strike activity pending the settlement of disputes under the grievance machinery of the contract was a permissive and not a prohibited activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.390" offset="13148975">The unions say that the collective bargaining history is enlightening upon the intention of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.229" offset="13208325">It says that as the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals held in the case of International Union United Mine Workers of America versus the National Labor Relations Board, which involved an interpretation of the 1952 Agreement and which is found in 257 F .2d of page 211.</text>

            <text syncTime="3315.968" offset="13367254">Now the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit gave no consideration to that collective bargaining history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.223" offset="13416260">The Court will recall that in the 1941 and 1945 Agreements that in the section of the contracts which provided for the grievance machinery itself that that Section committed the mine workers to a no-strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.374" offset="13532871">Now we say that in 1947 with the adoption of Section 301 of the Act that you have to consider for example that even though Congress recognized that -- and sought in that Act to reduce strikes in industrial unrest its legislative history supported the position that the right to strike was preserved and that the question of the waiver of a right to strike was in matter for collective bargaining and that is precisely what the parties in the 1947 and 1940 and 1950 contracts did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.620" offset="13741850">They preserved the right to strike by providing in there for the deletion, for the abrogation of the no-strike clauses that had occurred in previous contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.581" offset="13805693">We say that unless clear language has lost its meaning that no -- that the parties could not have expressed the right to strike in more definitive and unambiguous verbiage than they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.110" offset="13883852">That the right to strike was no longer waived but was reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.828" offset="13906735">If the contracting parties had intended that there should be no work stoppages pending settlement of disputes under the grievance machinery, we ask the question, “Why should they have so studiously provided for the recession of such clauses and that they should not be applicable, and that they should be rendered null and void?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.307" offset="13992626">Now the District of Columbia Circuit in the case that I have cited, says it is hardly conceivable that a stoppage of work could occur except as a consequence of a dispute which would be cognizable under the grievance procedure of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.252" offset="14068381">And that being so, what was eliminated unequivocally in subsection one was restored completely in subsection three if subsection three was a no-strike agreement, but the District of Columbia Circuit continued saying, “If we are to credit the parties with normal capacity to reason and express themselves, we cannot read subsection three as a no-strike agreement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.444" offset="14189171">We direct the Court's attention to the teachings of this Court in National Labor Relations Board versus Lion Oil Company which is found in 352 U.S. at page 282 where the Court declared that where there has been no express waiver of the right to strike a waiver of the right during such period is not to be inferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.226" offset="14288227">We also direct the Court's attention to the language found in the Act in Section 13 which declares that nothing in the Act except as specifically prohibited shall be construed so as either to interfere with or impede or diminish in anyway the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.128" offset="14367848">Now the District of Columbia Circuit pointing to that language says it seems to us that the spirit of the Section is an admonition to deciding tribunals not to interpret ambiguous provisions of contracts as amounting to no-strike agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3593.800" offset="14478608">Mr. Justice our position here is that it is one thing for contracting parties to agree to process matters to the grievance machinery, and that is precisely what took place here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.497" offset="14545377">We say that it is an entirely different matter for parties to agree not to strike pending the settlement of those disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.205" offset="14584142">We say that they are two entirely different things, and that that distinction was recognized by the parties in the earlier contracts when they said specifically that pending the hearing of disputes that the miners would not strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.799" offset="14650598">We say that the fact that those provisions were in the earlier contracts that they were cancelled and rendered null and void gives basic content to the intention of the parties and the interpretation to be placed upon this contract that when the parties in subsection (1) of the miscellaneous section cancelled the no-strike clauses that they cancelled them totally and unequivocally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.695" offset="14782151">That it was the intention of the parties to the contract that the right to strike was reinstated, that the unions were not to be subject to legal sanctions under Section 301 by virtue of strike activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.073" offset="14839620">And so we say that that a strike is not an alternative method of settling a dispute.</text>
