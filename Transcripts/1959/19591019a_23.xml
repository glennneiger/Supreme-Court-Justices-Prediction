            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 23, United States of America, Petitioner, versus Durham Lumber Company, et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.114" offset="187852">Mr. Heffron, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard A. Heffron</label>
            <text syncTime="31.682" offset="230066">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.795" offset="246575">This case is here on certiorari to the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.907" offset="262980">It involves another facet of the same general issue which was before the Court in the last argued case, Aquilino from the New York Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.344" offset="308746">The statutory scheme in North Carolina whose laws are involved in this case is somewhat different from the scheme of the New York statutes, but its purpose is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.134" offset="359946">And I will attempt to relate the North Carolina statutes and their effect as I discuss the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.695" offset="394115">The taxpayer here, as in Aquilino, is a general contractor who completed work on a construction contract with the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.338" offset="440717">The contract was completed and the proceeds are now due under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.878" offset="470915">The federal tax lien preceded here the assertion by the subcontractors of their rights under North Carolina law.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.597" offset="509785">Under the North Carolina statutory scheme, the subcontractors, they give notice to the owner of any liability which they claim owes to them from the general contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.365" offset="568822">As of that time, they have a right to sue the owner for the balance of any funds in the owner's possession which are owed to the general contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.851" offset="618768">In this case, the subcontractors gave their notice to the owner subsequent to the time the federal tax lien arose and the subcontractor's claimed that as a result of their action, the affect of North Carolina law was to give them an independent statutory right against the owner for the proceeds of the construction contract which were had yet been unpaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.207" offset="736214">The Fourth Circuit agreed with the subcontractors and held that their right was to be preferred to that of the Federal Government under the tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.326" offset="792639">Now, under the provisions of North Carolina law, the rights of the subcontractors do not arise until they do something -- until something affirmative is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.439" offset="833076">In this instance, that was the act of furnishing the owner with the notice required under North Carolina law.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.506" offset="865364">It is from that time that their rights date so that unlike the New York statute where the subcontractor's rights to the trust fund arose just as soon as their debt was unpaid by the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.838" offset="926699">Under North Carolina law, that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.773" offset="938506">The arising of the contractor's liability to the subcontractor is not the date from which the subcontractor's rights spring.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.664" offset="974033">The effect of date under North Carolina law is the date they supplied the affirmative act required of them by statute, which is to serve the notice upon the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.981" offset="1019277">Now, when that notice is served upon the owner under North Carolina law, the owner is directed by statute to hold the proceeds aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.538" offset="1065566">He may not pay the proceeds to the contractor on the construction contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.202" offset="1084165">If he does so, he will nevertheless have to settle with the subcontractors so that he faces the threat of double liability in that instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.794" offset="1122513">The North Carolina cases have said that the owner holds the proceeds in -- in what is in essence a trust fund and that the subcontractors derive a right after they furnish the required notice to have an accounting in an ordinary civil action, the accounting for the trust fund, so that in that respect the North Carolina scheme is similar to that which was before the Court in New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.840" offset="1302758">The North Carolina cases do, the statute does not, but the North Carolina cases have construed the effect of the giving of notice by the subcontractor as creating a trust fund in the hands of the owner of any funds he has which is not yet dispersed to the general contractor.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.885" offset="1430862">Yes, I believe the Fourth Circuit relied on the service of the notice by the mechanic as the act which gave right for their independent right to payment from the owner under North Carolina law.</text>

            <text syncTime="691.208" offset="2868224">Under the North Carolina statute, the subcontractor must perform an affirmative act.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.375" offset="2900825">He must supply a notice to the owner which states how much is due and owing to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.326" offset="2924648">And from that time, the trust stated under New York law no affirmative act is required of the subcontractor to the extent that at anytime, he has owed sums for his work.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.207" offset="2984208">At that time, the trust would arise with respect to any funds in the hands of the owner which are still due on the contract to the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.207" offset="3028198">Now, if we examine this trust, the so-called trust under either New York law or North Carolina law, I think it fails of one of the prime incidence of a conventional trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.967" offset="3075218">It is not the present transfer of a property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.237" offset="3092355">The so-called beneficiary here still has yet to prove his -- that the contractor is liable to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.800" offset="3126523">He still must meet the ordinary requirements of showing that he shows an action against the contractor has validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.160" offset="3160064">He must plead and prove that he's performed his contract with the contractor and that this sum is due and owing to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.058" offset="3187649">In that respect, we would submit that the -- the transfer of the property interest which -- which is implicit in the notion of trust has not yet occurred in the conventional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.236" offset="3236342">Here, the beneficiary still has various conditions which he must meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.763" offset="3250448">He must show compliance with his contract with the contractor here.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.585" offset="3269674">He must prove his cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.675" offset="3278033">We would submit on the other hand that the situation of the owner here after the notice has been given to him and after the so-called trust arises is really no different from what his situation would be if an attachment had been served on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.369" offset="3340831">For example, under New York law and I believe under the law of most jurisdictions, when an attachment is served on a party, that party is under direct order of the Court not to dispose of the funds allegedly owing to the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.170" offset="3400077">If he does dispose of them in anyway inconsistent with the attachment, he is not relieved of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.365" offset="3424841">He may still incur a liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.277" offset="3432469">He is formally directed by the writ of attachment to hold the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.674" offset="3450023">The funds await the disposition of the action brought against the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.430" offset="3473115">So here, we would submit that the effect of the notice which was served upon the owner was also to put the owner under order of state statute, not to dispose of the funds and if he did so, to dispose of them under pain of future liability to the subcontractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.113" offset="3555871">But while he was under this order not to dispose or deal with the funds in anyway, nevertheless, the subcontractor's rights were just as contingent as the rights of an attaching creditor or a garnishing creditor or a landlord under a distraint warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.090" offset="3623685">His rights were still subject to being tested by the outcome of the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.542" offset="3641553">He still had to prove the validity of his cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.126" offset="3655868">And we would submit that therefore, the subcontractors in this case, even though their rights be termed trust for some purposes under state law, have no greater rights vis-à-vis the custodian of the funds here, the owner than the attaching creditor had in the Acri case in the garnishing creditor had in the Liverpool and London case and on the landlord had under distress lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.743" offset="3758373">In the Scovil case, in all of those cases, this Court held that although it is conceded the effect of the attachment or the paper which had been served on the third party was to place that party under order of state law to refrain from disposing of the funds and to hold those funds pending the outcome of the litigation against the taxpayer, this Court held in all of those cases where the rights of the contending party had attached under state law prior to the tax lien that the Government would prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.904" offset="3906957">Now, here, of course, under our facts, the rights of the Government precede those of the subcontractors because the paper which set the force of state statute in motion had not been served until subsequent to the attaching of the federal tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.312" offset="3972577">Similarly in the mechanics' lien cases, the effect of serving the mechanics' lien and filing it and recording it, which was done in the White Bear case, for example, under state law, was to make the owner of the property require to hold it pending the outcome of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.280" offset="4052511">It was under direct order of state statute to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.938" offset="4063169">If he disposed of it, he could -- he could not discharge his liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.357" offset="4080828">He had to hold the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.204" offset="4088142">We submit that in essence as the effect of the trust in this -- under New York law and under North Carolina law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1940.509" offset="7865448">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.420" offset="7881017">I'm delighted that the Government has made the argument that it has because mine is a happy chore today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.708" offset="7910170">I think that on behalf of the respondents, whom I represent, that we have the facts on our side, the laws of the State of North Carolina are on our side, a very dedicated jurist, Judge Johnson Hayes is on our side and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals likewise up until this moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.221" offset="8004211">The question involved in this case appears to me to be whether or not a federal tax lien, the 32 -- 3621 creates any additional authority other than the bank that attaches to property and rights of property or can it divest previously vested state rights under state statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.982" offset="8119254">Now, I don't know about the scheme or device that others have referred to in this cause, but it's been the law in North Carolina for more than 85 years that one, once a subcontractor or a material supplier gave notice to the owner, it was against the law for the owner to pay the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.642" offset="8225938">That secondly, the contractor himself is under a legal duty and responsibility to furnish to the owner an itemization or a list of those to whom he is indebted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.881" offset="8282885">Either way once the owner gets notice, it's against the law for him to disgorge himself of the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.025" offset="8315486">Now, in this case, there's no question in our mind about the fact that the defaulting contractor bankrupt, as the case maybe, owes the Government some money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.638" offset="8369925">However, we are seeking to ascertain our statutory right against the owner, not against the defaulting contractor and therein lies the distinction between these other cases that the Government has cited.</text>
