            <text syncTime="23.445" offset="197151">The action in the Court of Claims was brought by the 27 petitioners, all of whom were suppliers and materialmen to a government contractor, the Rice Shipbuilding Corporation, to recover just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.041" offset="259532">In the court below, it was alleged that their property rights, that is the right to enforce their liens against the contractor's property, were taken from them when, after the Government terminated the contract for default, it required the contractor to transfer title to partially completed boats and materials therefore to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.846" offset="358797">Now, the Court of Claims found for the Government, on the grounds that at the time the petitioners claim to have acquired liens, the Government actually had what it termed “inchoate title” to the materials which made the boats a public work to which liens could not attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.768" offset="438418">The petitioners then sought review in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="115.718" offset="566209">Have the liens been perfected or were they just rights to liens in your view?</text>

            <text syncTime="122.450" offset="593168">No, the liens were as perfected as they could be and I might respectfully submit, Mr. Justice Whittaker, that the statute, and this was a main statute with which we're concerned, is set forth at page 2 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.354" offset="656802">It's Section 13 Chapter 178 Revised Statutes of Maine and it provides that liens -- whoever furnishes labor and materials for building a vessel has a lien which may be enforced by -- may be enforced by attachment within four days after the vessel is launched, and they also have a lien on the materials furnished before they become part of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.344" offset="756799">The full text is --</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="164.117" offset="759829">That -- that was just my question and my point.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.845" offset="770800">I believe thus -- this lien, as I understood that statute, could not be perfected until the vessel was launched and then it must be within four days after it's launched or if the vessel is not completed when launched, then within four days after the contract is completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.115" offset="855855">Is that what the complex statute said?</text>

            <text syncTime="190.578" offset="865677">And it goes on in the second full sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.487" offset="881351">It says that he also has a lien on the materials furnished before they become part of the vessel which may be enforced by attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.426" offset="917086">As -- I think the statute makes it clear that there is a lien which arises by virtue of the work and materials which is being done on these vessels, and it's to protect him up until the time that the vessel is launched and for four days thereafter, and his remedy is to attach the vessel or to attach the material in the event that the vessel is never completed.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.763" offset="1090435">The case came up to the -- came before the Court on cross motions for summary judgment because the facts were pretty much established.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.814" offset="1126588">And the Court, for the purpose of their -- of their decision, assumed that there would have been liens, I think this is a fair characterization of the Court's opinion, but they said that the liens could not attach because of what they call the Government's inchoate title which ran from the -- apparently from the beginning of the making of the contract.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="279.037" offset="1219480">Or if they did attach, they were junior, did the Government say?</text>

            <label>Mr. Burton R. Thorman</label>
            <text syncTime="281.698" offset="1230137">No, they -- they didn't get into that question because they stopped at this threshold question of there not being any liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.614" offset="1257827">Now, as I said, the contract started in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.453" offset="1273187">By August 2nd, 1955, Rice was unable to complete the contract and so, the contract was terminated then for default.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.866" offset="1310804">At the same time that the Government sent a termination letter, they requested Rice to transfer title to the uncompleted votes and to the materials which Rice had in hand to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.262" offset="1372453">And on August 4th, 1955, Rice executed an instrument of transfer of title transferring to the Government all right title and interest to the manufacturing materials designated by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.163" offset="1424071">This followed, by two days, the actual letter of termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.831" offset="1446745">Now, I think I may have neglected to mention that the boats under Rice's contract were to be built in the State of Maine, East Boothbay to be exact.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.113" offset="1483839">There were 11 personnel boats involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.137" offset="1495960">Following the termination and the execution of this transfer of title, Rice -- the Government took title and possession to the materials and took them out of the State of Maine to various navy yards where they completed the boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.561" offset="1561579">Now, Rice was, shortly after that, adjudicated a bankrupt and the Government filed claim in the bankruptcy court for its alleged cross of completion.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.897" offset="1598986">Now, in acquiring title, the Government acted in accordance with Section 11 (d) of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.097" offset="1631796">Section 11 is the default clause and the Section (d) is set forth at page 42 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.027" offset="1671502">This clause provided that, in the event of a default termination, the Government had an option to acquire title to any completed supplies and any uncompleted supplies which they designated as manufacturing materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.510" offset="1741406">It also provided further on that the Government would pay to the contractor either the contract price for completed supplies or the -- an agreed price for uncompleted supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.552" offset="1797622">Now, the contract with Rice also had a progress payments clause, under which Rice had received the aggregate of about $141,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.750" offset="1838373">This was based upon a percentage of completion less a 3% reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.400" offset="1860942">The progress payment clause provided that Rice was to-- that the Government rather, was to have a lien on all work in progress and that this was to be a paramount lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.000" offset="1911411">Now, as of April 11th, 1955, when Rice submitted its last progress payment voucher or invoice, Rice had incurred actual incurred cost of $198,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.419" offset="1981001">Subsequent to that, apparently, there was not sufficient amount of work done to warrant Rice putting in any further bills and ultimately, on August 2, 1955 when the Government terminated the contract, they did note that Rice had done no work or claim that Rice had done no work since March 25th, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.638" offset="2061876">Now, the lien which the Government acquired by virtue of this progress payment clause was not exercised by the Government, since the Government elected to take title under its option given to it under the default clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.637" offset="2121958">Now, the petitioners had furnished supplies, materials, and equipment to Rice --</text>

            <text syncTime="527.748" offset="2214327">Now, I think the legal effect was to merge the Government's lien in its title since, obviously, I think it's clear by law that one cannot have a subordinate interest in the same piece of property in which he has a dominant interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="567.092" offset="2371688">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the difficulty we have had with the concept to the Court of Claims is that, apparently, the Court felt that with the making of the contract, the Government then acquired its inchoate title.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.610" offset="2589863">The default clause in which the Government relied on in taking title here is a standard clause in most government contract, certainly throughout the military department.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.557" offset="2621628">And if the court below is right, if this inchoate title which they did not define means that it's a synonym for title, then there are a host of problems, as anybody who deals with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.521" offset="2689442">There's a host of problems in line of the Detroit against Murray Corporation type of situation as to whether or not the States and localities may tax this property in the possession of this people.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.944" offset="2739179">We think that it was unfortunate that the court below used this shorthand title without shorthand expression of inchoate title without defining it further but we think that if the Court is disposed to follow it, perhaps it could define it, and I don't think it can possibly mean that it would bar all liens, including taxes and taxes from attaching to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="942.740" offset="3874356">First, by the contract terms, the title to the property was in Rice during the performance of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.567" offset="3909674">First, on the face page of the contract, we find that title to the -- which appears at page 27 of the record, that the point of acceptance is at point of delivery and that delivery points are spelled out as various navy yards, Philadelphia and Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.394" offset="3988982">Further, the contract contained a discharge of liens clause which provided, and incidentally, that is at page 37 of the record, which provided that the contractor would immediately discharge or cause to be discharged any lien or right in rem of any kind other than favor of the Government against the property and that, failing in that duty, the Government reserved the right to discharge these liens at his expense, at the contractor's expense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.678" offset="4282075">Then, we have this default clause which states that, on condition of default of the contract, the Government acquired an option to require the contractor to transfer it -- transfer to the Government the title with the further provision in this option that the Government would have to pay for the materials it had taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.570" offset="4385625">Now, I think the Court of Claims missed the point that the default clause was a condition which only arose or that it was an option which only arose on condition that the contract -- contractor was in default and that the Government then exercised its option to terminate, and only at that point did the option arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.951" offset="4487189">Now, based upon these considerations, I submit, the contract clearly contemplated that Rice would have title at all times to the materials until delivery and acceptance of the boats or until the Government exercised its option after the default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.738" offset="4574333">Aside from the terms of the contract, the fact that the Government required the execution of an instrument of transfer of title, we -- we think, is significant of the Government's intention, that is, of the intention of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.871" offset="4646849">And I might note to the Court that the instrument of transfer of title appears at page 50 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.569" offset="4681644">Well, it starts on page 49.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.901" offset="4706931">So that, clearly, the Government, in asking that the transfer of title be executed, recognized that it would not then have title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.383" offset="4776939">The court below also stated that, because of this inchoate title, it considered the work in the nature of the public work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.896" offset="4822915">The cases we've read and have cited in our brief indicate that the public work concept, as the term “public work,” applies only to government property and the cases are very clear on this concept, on this principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.929" offset="4891042">The work is private if the title remains in the contractor and it's public if the title is in the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.940" offset="4963140">Now, while Rice had its -- had the title to the materials and the uncompleted boats, the p-petitioners supplied their material -- supplied materials and work to Rice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.623" offset="5013817">And at that time, they acquired their liens on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.621" offset="5029804">That is on the materials and uncompleted boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.821" offset="5042657">And it is interesting to note that the petitioners must have acquired their liens prior to the time that the Government acquired its paramount lien although we don't argue with the point that it is paramount because obviously, the work had to be done and the material supplied before there can be a state of completion which would warrant the Government issuing any progress payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.957" offset="5155192">Now, we say that Rice could transfer nothing more than it had and in the words of the instrument, it transferred all its right, title, and interest into the said manufacturing materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.971" offset="5211303">Now, I think that one word I've -- one or two words about the fact that the liens were still encumbrances on the property while the -- when the Government acquired it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.797" offset="5262608">The main statute is one of a class of statutes which, I suppose, could be broadly characterized as mechanics lien statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.275" offset="5304508">They're made in recognition of the entitlement to payment of the people who, by supplying work and materials, created such value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.390" offset="5336900">In a sense, the statues are designed to prevent unjust enrichment at the expense of the suppliers and workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.493" offset="5377337">Now, when the Government terminated the contract for default, since the title was in Rice, they had two options.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.626" offset="5417880">First, they could enforce their own lien -- enforce its own lien and secondly, to exercise the option under the -- under the default clause to acquire title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.597" offset="5477752">As I said before, when they terminated the contract, the contracting officer took the position in its termination letter that Rice had done no work after March 25, 1955, so that there was a chance, any good chance, that there are unpaid suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.202" offset="5552149">The Government knew that Rice had not done any work from March until August because Rice had ran out of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.074" offset="5591646">The Government then had its option to decide which was the most favorable course of action to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.664" offset="5622053">In any event, the Government did go ahead and exercised its option to acquire title rather than doing anything more about its liens.</text>

            <text syncTime="1560.480" offset="6345331">If I could draw it back just a moment, this is not a question of relative lien rights or any such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.172" offset="6376051">This is a taking case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.443" offset="6385142">These petitioners claim that the United States has taken some property of theirs under the Fifth Amendment for a public use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.245" offset="6420355">Appropriation cases classically are eminent domain cases, of course, in which there is some deliberate intent in the Government to appropriate, to take property rights in a private person and transfer them to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.781" offset="6474480">This is obviously not such a case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.387" offset="6488900">Related to those are the cases where, without regard to intent, this Court has found that there's been such a direct invasion of some recognized property right as to give rise to an implied intent to appropriate property for a public use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.231" offset="6564342">I submit that this case doesn't come anywhere near either of these categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.179" offset="6584090">If I may very briefly draw it back to defense, the contract was a standard form contract, a standard form supply contract which is handed out by years of experience and is designed to meet thousands of different procurement situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.127" offset="6647829">It was awarded in March of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.790" offset="6670503">It represented a firm requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1659.532" offset="6741452">In March of 1955, work seized and after some necessary procedures were taken and letters were written, the Government elected to take title under the 11 (d) which appears, as my opponent has stated, in the record at page 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.647" offset="6809997">Now, at the time this title was taken, the Government had paid roughly $141,000 or 80% of the fixed price which, in turn, was based on an estimate that the work was 80% completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.715" offset="6878229">So, the Government paid for what had been done and it took it under the standard forms default 11 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.956" offset="6911248">Now, this contract was the only contract that Rice had from the date of its incorporation to the day it closed its doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.399" offset="6944998">The supplies and materials in this case were supplied by these materialmen to Rice specifically for the purpose of this government contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.555" offset="6989615">It is so alleged in their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.979" offset="7003303">Then, they alleged very carefully on this lien point that when the Government took title under 11 (d) and the boats and materials were removed, where they were completed, I might add, at three navy yards, Philadelphia, Norfolk and New York, and an excess cost of the Government of about $146,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.023" offset="7083447">So, it looks like the estimate of the completion by Rice was a little optimistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.698" offset="7110196">Materialmen suppliers had given this material to Rice specifically for the purpose of this one contract and they say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.651" offset="7145932">That under the Maine law, Section 13 Chapter 178, they had a statutory-created privilege to a lien to be enforced by attachment and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.082" offset="7195669">Maine is a good old common law state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.786" offset="7202565">The steps they would have had to have taken to make this an enforceable right against anyone is set forth in the sections which followed Chapter 13, after starting an action with sums that each were a rid of attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.123" offset="7251884">All of this is ancillary to the claimed obligation against the debtor, in this case, Rice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1837.881" offset="7454908">Take the -- take the petitioner's theory here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.609" offset="7469850">They are faced with about 100 years of precedent in which it's always been held that the Government is not answerable to the materialmen and suppliers who deal with its contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.179" offset="7516139">The whole Miller Act factor on this passed put this in mind, recognizing that these people were on some risk in recognizing that the Government is not answerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.383" offset="7548949">Well, you have the requirement of the payment fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.841" offset="7558771">Again, and I'll show this in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.648" offset="7569951">This discharge of lien provision which is part of the standard form is again designed for two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.063" offset="7591581">One, if liens are recorded and known, the Government can, during the life of the contract, require the contractor to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.110" offset="7627839">Here, it might have been out of advanced progress payments, protect itself by recoupment, and at the same time, this gives a measure of protection to those who are dealing with the contractor during the life of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.764" offset="7670471">But the Government is not answerable for claims against its contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.564" offset="7697638">And I think Judge Jones was trying no more than to sum this situation, which is a classic situation, it's not an innovation by any means.</text>

            <text syncTime="1923.001" offset="7795336">Let me put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.439" offset="7805158">Title may pass at the outset of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.510" offset="7817383">It may pass pro tanto under progress payments clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.173" offset="7832116">It may pass at the completion of the work, satisfactorily performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.990" offset="7847372">Or, it may pass under 11 (d), the default provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.433" offset="7865135">Now, the reason that 11 (d) is important is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.945" offset="7883107">We have here, as I say, a firm requirement for certain boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.235" offset="7904319">In this situation, in the Government supply contract, the department involved estimates that the work presumably being 80% completed, it's worthwhile to pay the cost of protecting that work, transporting it, having it completed elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.941" offset="7959176">This is the quickest way to get something for which there is a need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.717" offset="7974222">Had this been, say, an electronics contract, it's very doubtful that the option under the default clause of having work completed elsewhere would have been invoked because electronic contracts normally involve shop processes and content readily be moved from one shop to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.993" offset="8039320">Again, where the work is needed, the title passing requirement under 11 (d) is necessary to prevent the contractor from holding up the department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.756" offset="8086444">If that provision were not there, he might say “Well, I won't give you this thing until you settle with me on value or a schedule or something like that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.383" offset="8112880">It might be a very time-consuming process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.784" offset="8122493">So that, right from the moment of contract, title may pass under a government contract in various ways and at various times.</text>

            <text syncTime="2791.482" offset="11269308">It's at best, the lost of a -- of a state-created step that these people could have taken to enforce a claim, an assumptive suit against Rice which they didn't file.</text>
