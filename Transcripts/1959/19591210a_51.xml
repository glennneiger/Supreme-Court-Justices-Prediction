            <text syncTime="39.950" offset="263189">The question which is presented is whether the Federal Trade Commission is authorized to regulate deceptive practices of a company which does a mail order insurance business, if the state of incorporation has a law which prohibits a domicile insurance company from engaging in deceptive practices inside that state or outside the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.021" offset="383457">The Commission filed a complaint against the respondent under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.920" offset="415013">Evidence was taken and hearing examiner issued and initial decision and this was appealed to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.334" offset="448658">It found that respondent's advertising was misleading in certain respects and it entered a cease-and-desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.957" offset="491186">The court below held by a majority vote, that Nebraska regulated respondent's advertising in other State and that this advertising, was thereby regulated by State law within the meaning of this proviso of Section 2 (b) of the McCarran Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.459" offset="593168">The Court knows that that Act was passed to authorize state regulation and taxation of insurance companies free from Commerce Clause limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.134" offset="651891">It provides that no act of Congress which does not specifically deal with the insurance business shall invalidate or supersede any state legislation in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.441" offset="713122">The Act was passed to remove doubts as to validity of state legislation which is had been caused by the decision of this Court in Southeastern Underwriters case.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.233" offset="808312">Well, I think it did -- if the doubts were there, they were removed I suppose [Attempt to Laughter].</text>
            <text syncTime="187.022" offset="851466">As to the antitrust laws, including the Federal Trade Commission Act, special provision was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.758" offset="882395">These laws were not to apply to the insurance business before June 30, 1948, now there was a moratorium.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.916" offset="919071">By the proviso of Section 2 (b), they were to apply after that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.611" offset="945821">The proviso was before this Court in National -- in National Casualty case, at the 1957 term.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.233" offset="996289">The companies there involved did business only through agents and they were licensed in every state in which they sold policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.529" offset="1037458">The advertising which the Commission had found to be deceptive was shipped to the agents and they distributed locally to potential purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.717" offset="1094196">The Court said that in view of this local distribution, the laws of the States regulating deceptive insurance advertising unquestionably were enforceable against the activity within their respective boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.040" offset="1175489">And it held that where States were regulating this kind of advertising under their own laws, it was regulated by State law within the McCarran Act provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.669" offset="1230033">The facts in the present case were -- presented a very different picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.991" offset="1255320">Respondent has no agents and all its business is solicited by mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.148" offset="1283950">It sells policies in all States, but it is licensed only in Nebraska and Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.910" offset="1323029">It sends a series of letters to prospect sometimes as many as 30, including in the letters, policy application, a policy application form and advertising material.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.262" offset="1384469">It issues all policies, pays all claims and conducts this promotion material from its home office which is in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.895" offset="1434937">The names of prospects are obtained from its own policy-holders and it solicits only white-collar workers, in fact only white, white-collar workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.539" offset="1485511">The policy, which it offers, provides for payment for the specified sum during each week that the insurance is disabled by sickness, there's a maximum period of 52 weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.865" offset="1542875">A State customarily regulates conduct which is within its borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.168" offset="1572028">Phrase regulated by State law as applied in connection with prohibition of certain conduct would ordinarily be understood to mean regulation by the law of the State where conduct occurs and has its adverse effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.448" offset="1653112">I think that there is particular reason for giving the phrase this meaning into the McCarran Act, because its affect in that Act is to withdraw from the public the protection given by certain federal statutes to the extent that State law gives protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.976" offset="1735241">The Trade Commission Act protects the public against deceptive acts and practices in all interstate transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.499" offset="1777351">Preventing deceptive promotion, or sale of policies which insure against some of the laws covered by sickness or accident is certainly as of much public concern as protecting it against deceptive promotion of sale of ordinary items of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.402" offset="1868988">There is every reason to believe that Congress would not have withdrawn the protection of federal act on the basis of State protection unless the state protection was given by a law readily available to the persons affected; that is the law of the State where the insured lived and was mislead.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.020" offset="2019453">The Committee Report on the bill in both the House and Senate said that it was a purpose of Congress to secure adequate regulation of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.444" offset="2077132">Section 10 -- this -- the proviso of Section 2 (b) was not in the bill as passed in the Senate or in the bill as passed in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.890" offset="2118928">It came into the bill -- it was introduced in the bill by the conferees pointed to adjust the differences between the two branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.027" offset="2159470">Senator McCarran was one of the three Senate conferees and speaking of this proviso, he said that Federal legislation would not be displaced except by State law amicably covering the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.481" offset="2233344">Senator Ferguson was another of the conferees.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.800" offset="2254555">He said that If a State authorized a monopolistic combination of insurance companies which did business in numerous States that would immunize them from the Sherman Act, in the State of enactment, but not in other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.406" offset="2321011">Senator O'Mahoney, the third conferee, made a quite similar statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.984" offset="2343267">In other words, regulation by State law which displaces federal statute is regulation by the law of the locality.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.265" offset="2392482">In Travelers Health against Virginia, this Court referred to the unwisdom, unfairness and injustice of permitting policy-holders to enforce their claims against an insurer only in some distant State where the insurer is incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.926" offset="2483075">In McGee against International Insurance at the 1957 term, it said that if policy-holders having policies by an out-of-state insurer, would if they -- they would be at a severe disadvantage, if forced to follow the insurance company to a distant State in order to hold it legally accountable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.147" offset="6535920">We're assuming that they could reach them by mail, although there's no such provision in the Model Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.108" offset="6559848">Now, I would like to point out that the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission to regulate mail order insurance advertising has been recognized by the industry itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.881" offset="6614915">And it is recognized that it has this jurisdiction because the States are unable to regulate effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.893" offset="6646993">The Commission exercised this jurisdiction by promulgating, in February 1950, Fair Trade Practice Rules governing mail order insurance advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.662" offset="6697984">An article based on interviews with state and federal officials and insurance companies and trade association officers written by the Assistant Attorney General of Kansas, stated that this rules had been promulgated at the instigation of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.710" offset="6778232">An article written by the general counsel of the National Bureau Casualty Underwriters says that these rules were issued as the out grow for the general industry conference of mail order insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.922" offset="6835075">Another writer gave as a probable cause for the adoption of the rules the fact that the problem of mail order accident in health insurance had been a troublesome one for years and the States seemed unable to deal with it adequately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.358" offset="6908844">In closing, I would just like to call attention to the fact that I think inadvertently, the request made in the conclusion in our brief is too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.645" offset="6949909">The respondent has not criticized this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.594" offset="6965791">We ask that the Court reverse the judgment below and with directions to deferring the Commission's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.250" offset="6996407">It appears that respondent did not abandon in the court below its contention that the evidence wasn't sufficient to support the findings as to the misleading affect of its representations and the Court did not pass in this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.207" offset="7076237">I assume, therefore, that if judgment is reversed, the case should be remanded for further proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.817" offset="7142588">Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Associate Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.228" offset="7164322">Nebraska had a brief equivalent of a Fair Trades Practice Act, as far back as 1913, it's quoted in my brief, long before anyone ever dream of South-Eastern or the McCarran Act, or subsequent happenings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.379" offset="7244884">The brief, of course, contains the terrific match of Nebraska regulatory legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.932" offset="7523140">Nebraska does regulate the Travelers Health Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.249" offset="7523035">It does regulate the insurance business in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.349" offset="7522931">Nebraska gave Travelers Health Association the only light that has when granted of the charter in 1904.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.486" offset="7522826">Nebraska requires that Travelers Health be financially responsible, requires that settlement of claims and all that sort of thing, the conduct of the business, the conducting in a descent and a high class manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.344" offset="7522722">Nebraska requires Travelers to report annually, what it received, what it paid out, what it's got on hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.121" offset="7522617">Nebraska, every three years, examines everything that Travelers Health does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.114" offset="7543829">The State prescribes that what its policy form shall contain, what policy form shall not contain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.909" offset="7586983">Nebraska, I think its 1948 about 1949, adopted a department rule, number 16, which is in the record, requiring all Nebraska companies to keep a complete file of its advertising material available for the convenient examination and checking of examiners of the Nebraska Insurance Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.837" offset="7694712">Nebraska joined with the a large number States in -- through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in creating what became known as the advertising rules, copy of the rules attached to Nebraska Attorney General's amicus brief which is joined in by 27 other States and I think referred to in a separate amicus brief of Illinois and also in the amicus brief of Health Insurance Association of America and the American Mutual Insurance Alliance. With all due respect to counsel, I've lived with this case for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.363" offset="7912782">I've lived with the insurance regulation for about 19 years having formally been insurance commissioner of the State of Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.154" offset="7947995">I'm sure counsel did not mean to misstate, but in the court below and the Eighth Circuit, we used as second barrel in our gun, so to speak, Travelers versus Virginia and, of course, later followed by the McGee case, McGee versus International.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.026" offset="8039528">So counsel misspoke and I'm sure he did it unintentionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.119" offset="8063875">Nebraska does regulate the other States, in effect, in their amicus briefs have said that they regulate the various retaliatory laws of States and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners having its membership all of the States of the union plus, Puerto Rico and Virgin Island, I believe, composes an interlocking or network of regulation on a state basis, but nevertheless with a voluntary national aspect that really regulates this business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.650" offset="8253942">I'd be happy to attempt to answer any questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.755" offset="8266376">I rather deal with -- I've responded to counsel's argument up to this point at least.</text>
