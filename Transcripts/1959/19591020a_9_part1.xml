            <label>Mr. Stanley Fleishman</label>
            <text syncTime="18.285" offset="176462">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.036" offset="207496">The appellant in this case, if the Court please, was convicted and given a 30-day jail term for the possession in his bookstore of a hard covered book entitled, “Sweeter Than Life.”</text>
            <text syncTime="42.962" offset="275205">The facts are undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.762" offset="286386">There's no question, but that Mr. Smith owned the store and the book was, in fact, in the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.878" offset="318882">The courts below, if the Court please, found that the book was obscene and being obscene, there were no First Amendment constitutional questions arising out of the fact that he was being punished for the possession of a book.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.268" offset="392443">The courts below also took the position that the appellant had no right to introduce any evidence on the questions of "contemporary community standards" on what was being read generally, what was in bookstores generally and, what was the standards of the community concerning the discussion of sex in general and that similarly the impact of the book on average person was of no concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.623" offset="537893">The court said that if the trial court, the appellate court that is say, said that if the trial court had used a standard that was less than what this Court set forth in Roth-Alberts, it did not matter, that the States were free to set a different standard, one which would reach more books.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.876" offset="618872">And finally, the court held that it was proper for the municipality to take out all scienter that a bookseller could, without offending the Constitution, be found guilty even though he had not read the book and even though he had no notice of any kind that there was anything wrong with the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.246" offset="716361">My colleague, Mr. Rosenwein, will discuss all of the problems arising out of the statute in terms of the elimination of scienter, and I will discuss all of the problems concerning the book itself, that would be points two, three, and four in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.382" offset="784906">Our first point is that the book, “Sweeter than Life”, simply is not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.754" offset="810402">To put it the other way that it is not the kind of a book that the States or the Federal Government can suppress or can punish a person for the possession of it without doing serious violence to the First and the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.546" offset="889605">Now we start, of course, with the Roth-Alberts decision and while much that the Court said there was foreshadowed by prior decisions I think there were two things that were done which were important and which afforded a great deal of protection or should have afforded a great deal of protection to all literature concerning with sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.919" offset="987094">The first thing that the Court did was to say, and for the first time I believe, that sex and obscenity were not synonymous.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.948" offset="1027114">That sex was an important subject matter fully entitled to all of the protection that you would have if you were discussing politics, religion, or labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.537" offset="1081553">Now this, if the Court please, was a big step forward because the --</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="248.242" offset="1096391">You mean even up to that time it was doubtful whether any reference to relations between the sexes, any recognition of the fact that there are men and women in the world with any knowledge tells an obscene subject was theretofore to be?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="264.954" stopTime="319.038">
            <label>Mr. Stanley Fleishman</label>
            <text syncTime="264.954" offset="1163160">Theretofore, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.857" offset="1166817">I believe that the term, “dirt for dirt's sake” was equated by the trial court with the expression, “sex for its own sake.”</text>
            <text syncTime="272.270" offset="1192417">That you couldn't discuss sex for its own sake, it had to be enmeshed with other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.503" offset="1209344">You had to justify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.609" offset="1213837">For example, in the Times Film case which Your Honors had just recently, the City of Chicago, tried to suppress the film, “Game of Love” under a stand which says that if the purpose of the book was to arouse sexual desires, it was obscene unless it had sufficient merit, unless it had compensating value.”</text>
            <text syncTime="298.241" offset="1296384">Now in Alberts, it was put forward that we didn't have to justify the writing about sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.746" offset="1322402">That sex was not obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.160" offset="1332015">That you could talk about sex without having to say, “We want to wrap it up in another package.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.753" offset="1350405">We didn't have to justify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.551" offset="1357615">And this we think is the first important step forward and the second thing that this Court --</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley Fleishman</label>
            <text syncTime="339.395" offset="1460955">Well, I don't think that the Court can fairly look at the body of obscenity laws that existed before Roth-Alberts without recognizing that most courts took the position that the discussion of sex was something to be discouraged, and suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.826" offset="1522709">And that unless you could say, “Yes, it has sex but it's justifiable because of the other notions there that a person with such a book was in trouble.”</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="363.044" stopTime="368.335">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="363.044" offset="1555519">I wonder how much of the literature except technical scientific literature would be left in the world if that has been true.</text>

          <turn speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="368.335" stopTime="569.271">
            <label>Mr. Stanley Fleishman</label>
            <text syncTime="368.335" offset="1576730">Well, this was part of what our problem was in Roth-Alberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.458" offset="1589164">We were saying just that Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.854" offset="1594807">We were saying that too many books were under two bigger clouds.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.713" offset="1606196">But we put that to a side in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.022" offset="1615496">Now this Court did say and I think for the first time, that sex and obscenity were not synonymous and then to emphasize the First Amendment aspect involved in any writing whether it'd be it by way of novel or educational work for material dealing with sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.792" offset="1682578">And the second one is to say, that no book dealing with sex could there -- hereafter, be found to be obscene unless it went beyond contemporary community standards and appealed to the prurient interest of the average normal person considering the book as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.690" offset="1766170">And this Court again in terms of showing the narrowness of the new rule as the Court understood, it said the door could be opened only the slightest crack for any federal or state intrusion into this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.761" offset="1810369">It couldn't be left ajar and then in a series of papers shortly after Roth-Alberts, this Court gave depth and width to the rulings in Roth-Alberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.165" offset="1860002">There was a (Inaudible) case dealing with the magazine which was found to be obscene by the two courts below unanimously reversed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.075" offset="1895633">There was one magazine, a homosexual magazine vying for homosexuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.041" offset="1915486">The Ninth Circuit characterized it as cheap pornography, unanimously reversed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.200" offset="1940146">There was the Times Film case involving the film, “Game of Love” reversed by this Court I believe 7-to-2.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.854" offset="1970761">There was Mount case where the court below sought to have a standard which was broader than what was involved in Roth-Alberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.710" offset="2010258">There the courts below said that it could have offended the sense of decency, propriety, and morality that the work was obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.759" offset="2038366">The Solicitor General confessed error and upon remand the case went back to the trial court and the material which the trial court theretofore had found was obscene, on remand he said it was not obscene under the more demanding standard of this Court in Roth-Alberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.625" offset="2105866">And then finally of course there was the Kingsley case just recently decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.476" offset="2129272">The short of it is, we suggest Your Honor, that there is now the kind of limitation upon suppression of this kind of speech which is measured in large measure at least by the kind of material which was presented to this Court by the Solicitor General in the Roth case what he designated as hardcore pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.369" offset="2216835">This, the Court will recall, consisted primarily of pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.398" offset="2232926">It consisted of movies, and the cheap productions which were thought to have no ideas, no ideas at all and with all the deference I think that we must recall what it was that the Court had before it there.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.535" offset="2293530">It was a statute only on its face that was being sustained within a framework of the Solicitor General saying that we don't want to reach very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.525" offset="2333445">All we do say is that we should be allowed to reach something and then giving to the Court the kind of thing that they thought should be reachable and only the kind of thing that should be reachable.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley Fleishman</label>
            <text syncTime="584.749" offset="2442324">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.432" offset="2445145">I think that at least on three occasions the Court has said that there was a single standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.115" offset="2463848">That neither the Federal Government nor the State could go below this line in terms of suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.336" offset="2488717">Now we turn to the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.885" offset="2498957">We turn to the book, “Sweeter than Life” and what do we find?</text>
            <text syncTime="604.652" offset="2521945">I dare say that had this book come before the members of this Court or any tribunal, without the problems of a claim of obscenity, that this simply wouldn't have been a question about it being a protected book.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.174" offset="2584116">There's nothing about the way it looks, feels, the way it's printed, or the way it is written which suggests that it can be obscene under the demanding standards of this book.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.711" offset="2642213">That the book has important ideas of it, it seems to us to be beyond question.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.323" offset="2668648">For example, it has as a suggestion, that female homosexuality is not necessarily inherited.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.486" offset="2709295">That it is environmentally caused and that you do well to look at the attitudes of parents and friends and events to understand this.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.395" offset="2764988">It tells us that many people who are afflicted with this aberration seek to compensate by amassing money and power and the mistaken thought that this will overcome it or at least be a deficient-compensating factor and finally the book says that revenge on society because of such an aberration is foolish.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.740" offset="2870314">Now, I'm not saying, and I'm sure that no one here would say that this is great literature, but how many of the novels that are put out today can go under the label of great literature nor certainly can the Court sit in terms of passing literary judgment upon a work.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.770" offset="2962474">But here we have a book which has ideas, the importance of discussing the theme of homosexuality at this time particularly, cannot be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.633" offset="3001866">In England for example, the entire sexual code is undergoing a revision and having as its purpose the making of it lawful to permit voluntary partners of adults to engage in homosexual activity without offending the criminal code.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.724" offset="3078248">And the American Law Institute in its model code has made a similar proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.206" offset="3112208">Now if the people are to act wisely, if we are to fulfill our part in terms of informing our legislators on how we fill upon this important subject, surely the subject as such must be open.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.282" offset="3176469">People must be allowed to pick and choose and I don't know how, a novel could be written about homosexuality which would be realistic and meaningful without depicting in some way, the fact that there are sexual relations between members of the same sex and that is, we submit all that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.217" offset="3304260">In terms of the manner in which the sexual scenes or depictions were set forth in the book, I think that without pressing the point too much in this, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter has suggested, you wouldn't have a novel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1023.405" offset="4197021">So that our first point in this regard is that the book simply is a protected book and it does direct offense to the First and Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution by permitting Los Angeles to punish this bookseller who is not pandering.</text>

            <text syncTime="1078.033" offset="4415509">This Court having given us a defense, namely, that if our book does not go beyond contemporary community standards it could not be condemned, we sought to avail ourselves of that defense and we brought in expert witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.179" offset="4476113">We brought in for example the book review critic of the Los Angeles Times who testified that he read some 30 books a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.776" offset="4510490">That he was familiar with contemporary community standards and who was about to tell the Court how this book compared with the books that were on the market generally and we were cut off and the trial court took the position that the book spoke for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.439" offset="4581125">It had to be measured only by what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.280" offset="4592515">It couldn't be compared with other books and in this the trial court was affirmed by the Appellate Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.450" offset="4621145">The Appellate Department went back to the old case of Wepplo which preceded Alberts and there it was said it doesn't matter if there are the same books or sexually more provocative books on the market generally in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.893" offset="4682898">Whether the book is in the library is of no concern, all of this was ruled out both on the trial court and by the appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.695" offset="4718111">In this we say we were denied due process of law, if the Court please, because certainly if we had evidence to present on an issue and if one of the issues before the Court was, does our book go substantially beyond contemporary community standards to deny us any opportunity, not just the opportunity by one way, but to deny us all opportunities to show that our book did not go beyond contemporary community standards, to show that our book did not have a substantial tendency to corrupt or deprave, to show that our book considered as a whole could be read candidly and openly by the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.481" offset="4861262">That it did not appeal to a prurient interest, it's denied to us, we suggest due process of law, and again it is denied to us free speech because unless we're given the opportunity of presenting evidence on the fact that our book does not go beyond contemporary community standards a trier of fact who may not be informed about contemporary community standards may believe that our book is not constitutionally protected and punish a person for the possession, when in fact it is a constitutionally protected book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.125" offset="4999920">The trier of the fact here for example, Judge Pope, apparently was particularly concerned with the plot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.040" offset="5027506">He was disturbed by the notion that there was a woman who left her husband to take up with another woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.358" offset="5056763">This bothered him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.204" offset="5064182">It appears that he was not familiar with the literature in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.976" offset="5079228">It's no reflection upon and I wouldn't expect him to be as well read as a book review critic, but surely he should have known before he passed judgment that there were hundreds and hundreds of books including hundreds of novels which dealt with this theme and which dealt with this theme as candidly, as openly, and as frankly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.666" offset="5170030">And that without this knowledge, the judge was unable to pass intelligently upon this question and in fact reached the book which had no basis and should not have been reached.</text>

            <text syncTime="1347.368" offset="5492799">No, in this bookshop there was no showing or an attempt to show that this book -- this bookshop had anything but the normal kind of books that you would find in a Brentano's or any other bookshop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.909" offset="5538983">There was no attempt to show that there was any catering to a special class or that there was a predominance of one kind of book over another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.185" offset="5572106">I do believe that it came out in the record that there were magazines such as Life, Vogue, and Cosmopolitan in the totality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.568" offset="5597602">He had thousands of books and magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.419" offset="5609096">It was a large bookstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.801" offset="5614529">I think the police officers testified generally as to the character of the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.040" offset="5635532">And it appeared to be good-sized bookshop, without any emphasis on any particular kind of material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.829" offset="5698644">Now the third point that we have raised and I will discuss is the standard that was utilized by the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.034" offset="5743470">We have said that it was essentially a Butler, (Inaudible) and Patrick standard, however, you want to formulate it, but what seems clear to us is that the trial court took the position that he was essentially a thermometer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.059" offset="5819643">That he was there for the purpose of measuring the heat of the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.738" offset="5850363">When we suggested that the test of this Court was it had to be the impact of a material on an average normal person, he said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.253" offset="5884426">He said its average normal persons who determined the impact upon use in particularly susceptible persons and this came through again and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.878" offset="5942836">He said for example that he was depressed by the reading of the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.953" offset="5959137">We suggested that that may be, but how does that make it criminal?</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.308" offset="5984632">How does that prove that it goes beyond contemporary community standards that appeals to prurient interest and then he went off in the direction of well it depressed me because I may -- I'm vaccinated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.079" offset="6023711">I've lived my life and we have to think of how it would affect the young and the unprotected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.532" offset="6053491">And it was this in this regard, I think, that the Court, the appellate court's determination that it was free to fashion a standard, less demanding than this Court's standard in Roth-Alberts must be understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.016" offset="6111483">And it was interesting in another regard where the appellate court apparently tried to read out the notion of the book having to go beyond contemporary community standards before it could be reached as an obscene book because Judge David said that if the people wanted to they could give -- they could redefine these words which are so commonly understood by the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.509" offset="6225377">And by that I understood him to be saying that obscene has a meaning, an ordinary meaning and the legislature has not changed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.847" offset="6258709">Our position was throughout the case that in effect this Court in Alberts had read into every obscenity statute at least the proviso that no books could be condemned as obscene if it did not go beyond contemporary community standards, if it did not appeal to prurient interest of the average person considering the work as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.504" offset="6361422">Again it should be recalled that here the Appellate Department did not try to justify in any legal sense at least, the determination that the book was obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.457" offset="6421191">There was no discussion of the book when we suggested that the wrong test was applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.016" offset="6443447">The Appellate Department said, “Well, it doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.432" offset="6453060">We'll say it's obscene under any test.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.041" offset="6463509">And then we had the problem of the easy labeling that Mr. Justice Harlan properly warned against in terms of just giving a stamp on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.495" offset="6501334">So that we in effect and in truth, in this case, find ourselves with a defendant who was given 30 days in jail for having in his possession a book which has as its major crime, the fact that it discusses a theme of lesbianism and that it does so with some degree of realism and that is all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.266" offset="6620453">The crucial issue here it seems to me, is not so much whether the book goes beyond contemporary community standards or at least the issue below seems to be not whether it went beyond contemporary community standards, but whether it was good, whether it was right to have this kind of discussion going on and it was because the trial court felt that it was not good, because the trial court thought it was not right, that he found it to be obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.025" offset="6731421">Whether we think it's good or bad though, of course has nothing to do with the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.182" offset="6748139">We may personally prefer one way or the other, but that is not the test and the test has to be under the appropriate test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.001" offset="6787427">If we were to apply this Court's ruling in Roth-Alberts it would be manifest that this book is as far away from being obscene as one could imagine and still be up before this Court at least to have with the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1700.556" offset="6905605">The other aspect of the case is the exclusion of all scienter requirements from the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.383" offset="6932877">The court below held that this statute was to be equated with those public welfare offenses which exclude all requirements of the intent or scienter and punish proprietors or individuals who have violated the law without regard to any question of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.744" offset="7030366">These public welfare offenses the court referred to dealt with the sale of adulterated food, the sale of dangerous weapons, the abatement of some public nuisances, the sale of narcotics, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.779" offset="7106539">After having reviewed those cases, the Court said, “And so with books.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.079" offset="7127646">And so the Court held that the -- a proprietor of a bookshop could properly be convicted for possessing an obscene book even if he had no knowledge of the contents or the character of the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.476" offset="7197236">The Court said, “Unless some higher court told it otherwise, they would not permit the proprietor of a bookshop with impunity to adopt that poetic phrase, ‘where ignorance is bliss, it's folly to be wise'.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.597" offset="7269752">Now our position with respect to this statute or at least the issues presented are that the statute thus construed and applied tends directly to abridge, to invade the areas of speech and press that it creates as to an innocent person again those indefinite standards of criminality which were mooted in Alberts and Roth and bring all of the problems back once again.</text>

            <text syncTime="2171.526" offset="8789452">And so in this case, too, there can be no doubt that this would be the inevitable result because he cannot.</text>

            <text syncTime="2206.301" offset="8928528">And if, as a matter of fact the test in the state court is perhaps not the same and there has been some differences as to whether it is or not, he must then say, “to be on the safe side, does the book taken as whole and measured by the average person and applying contemporary community standards, have a substantial tendency to corrupt and deprave him by arousing lascivious thoughts and lustful desires?</text>

            <text syncTime="2531.778" offset="10230471">But once you begin to construe and apply it to an innocent person, I think you will then reach that vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.216" offset="10256280">And it is not a problem that has really been settled and I'm talking of the indefiniteness but only recently, the Nebraska Supreme Court invalidated its own obscenity statute under its own constitution after it had been asked to put the interest of the Alberts' definition, this Court's definition on its statute and after putting that impress on said, “We regret it still remains vague under our Constitution” and invalidated its own law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.695" offset="10390131">Certainly then as to an innocent person, we would assert that the statute -- the ordinance here is also constitutionally in front.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.853" offset="10434748">Now, if it be a question of balancing, if it could be said that well even so with all the inroads, nevertheless the State has an interest, a legitimate interest in protecting the public morals, I would, without attempting to cavil as to whether that is so or not safe, that in this case under this situation, it might be argued that it fairly minimal because as I said before, this is not the thrust, this is not the unwanted material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.546" offset="10553553">This isn't even a newspaper on in front of your house everyday which you are always compelled to read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.297" offset="10576541">This is a book shelf where people don't have to go in if they don't want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.760" offset="10594408">Therefore, the extent of corruption of public morals from an obscene book from an ordinary bookshop would seem to be fairly minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.168" offset="10632025">But admitting that there is some state interest, I would like to point out besides this definite, it seems to us inroads of the constitutional protection, the unreasonableness of the thing, the -- the harshness and the oppressiveness of the thing that -- that seems to us outweighs whatever alleged State interest there may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.194" offset="10736097">In the first place, from the very nature of things, if this is a policing problem, let us say, the State – the municipality must say to it's a bookseller's, look here, we want some help on this question of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.562" offset="10801612">Now if few people will make a good faith effort, if you will honestly try to get rid of your obscene books, we won't prosecute you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.548" offset="10845602">But here the State says, “We don't care how much you try to get rid of obscene books no matter how much good faith you use, we going to treat you the same as any lawbreaker.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.103" offset="10891786">Now that doesn't help to fight the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.100" offset="10907773">It seems to us it drives them in the opposite direction and that doesn't seem to be a very reasonable thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.676" offset="10942046">Now if there's been an equation with public welfare offenses, but when I go in to buy a piece of meat, a pound of meat, I have no idea whether it's tainted or not and I go home and jot it down and I'm absolutely helpless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.239" offset="11000351">The public is helpless in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.579" offset="11009651">We have tons of books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.765" offset="11014457">We've entirely different situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.688" offset="11022085">When I go into a book, I don't rely on the books though.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.447" offset="11033161">I don't think very many people do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.971" offset="11043297">And if I may browse, I make my own decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.762" offset="11054373">I take the book home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.232" offset="11060328">I may read part of it and discard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.295" offset="11068583">I'm not helpless with respect to these books -- book proprietor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.127" offset="11091884">I make my own determinations and the equation to other public welfare offenses which do not involve the important basic societal interest like free speech, it seem to us to be somewhat arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.872" offset="11166908">Moreover, there's a stigma to be called a smut dealer, a merchant in obscenity and to have this put on an innocent man, seems to me to be a savage, immoral thing to do, under the guise of protecting public morals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.246" offset="11232319">It's something you can't eliminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.097" offset="11243708">And as to difficulties approved, I would like to say this that since specially decision in this Court, that Connecticut, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and many a number of other states has all put in requirements of a lewd intent, of guilty -- of guilty knowledge of scienter and have written, by the way the Supreme Court of Connecticut has just said that this they found a salutary provision in marking the line between due process, the procedural due process and substantive due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.636" offset="11377873">The American Law Institute rejects any notion of a conclusive -- conclusive presumption of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.225" offset="11404309">California has followed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.016" offset="11411414">In Ireland we called attention to a very recent decision in which this Court's decisions in Alberts and Roth were all reviewed and special emphasis was placed on, in freeing a person charged with exhibiting an obscene and indecent show which was the Rose Tattoo by the American dramatist Tennessee Williams was placed on the intent, on the failure of any proof of intent as saving freedom of the press and speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.792" offset="11542549">It's there under a fairly different constitution which permits more inroads to speak than here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2876.824" offset="11610676">And we point out in our brief finally that in California, the State has had this rule of proof of lewd intent for a hundred years and had no difficulty and as a matter of fact in many other areas in the field of bigamy, even with possession of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.442" offset="11685177">Under the State California Supreme Court rules, you have to prove possession of knowledge of the narcotic character and then there has been no difficulty in proving it in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.937" offset="11735124">Nobody is an absolute guarantor and it seems to us that frankly on a case-to-case basis, there's no more difficulty in proving knowledge or a state of mind which is being proved everyday as we know, then perhaps approving the receiving stolen goods and knowing that the goods were stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.440" offset="11821119">There are problems but they are met every day and there will be no reason why on the case by case basis, it could not be just as successful.</text>

            <text syncTime="3174.155" offset="12799979">And the dissent was based upon that distinction and the dissenting judge as did all the judges specifically found that the book was obscene, but the dissent was based on the fact that we could not make a more restrictive law than the state law and the majority held to the contrary and of course that is binding and it's been a question of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.485" offset="12897364">Now directing our question to this distinction, between the state law and our ordinance, the question that's definitely presented is guilty knowledge, a specific intent, a necessary element of a law prohibiting the sale of an obscene book.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.334" offset="12968730">Now, it's well established that the State may, in the exercise of its police power, provide that he who shall do a prohibited act, so do it at his peril and that good faith or ignorance is not a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.568" offset="13029648">That's the first time that was specifically before this Court I believe as in the case Shevon versus Carpenter, a Minnesota case and I think these cases are pretty well cited in our brief and in the opinion of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.432" offset="13081057">It's been reaffirmed by this Court in many, many instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.247" offset="13100387">It's been argued here that the buyer may select the book himself and therefore he is under no hazard, but of course we also have laws prohibiting the sale of narcotics to a willing buyer.</text>
