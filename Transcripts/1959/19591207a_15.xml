            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="11.033" offset="147519">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.171" offset="160057">This case is here on a writ of certiorari for the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.293" offset="192554">The National Labor Relations Act imposes upon employers and unions alike the duty to bargain collectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.999" offset="227349">The statute defines this duty as the -- as the mutual obligation of both the employer and the representative of the employees to bargain, to meet and confer -- to meet and confer in good faith concerning the terms and conditions of employment and to reduce to writing upon request any agreement which it may arrive.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.657" offset="318046">The respondent union in this case in order to bring pressure to bear upon the employer to yield to its bargaining demands engaged in a program under which the employees remained on the job, group compensation, but refused to perform important functions of their job.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.045" offset="395577">There can be no question I think that by engaging in these activities, the employees expose themselves to discharge without recourse to the protection of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.015" offset="439463">The question which we have here is whether these tactics -- these tactics are permissible bargaining technique under the Act or whether a union which engages or directs the employees to engage in such activities and such tactics is guilty of a refusal to bargain in good faith within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.236" offset="532355">The facts which give rise to our problem can be summarized quite briefly, the respondent union has, for some years, represented the insurance agents of the Prudential Insurance Company throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.229" offset="592332">These agents who number many thousands are engaged in the business of selling insurance for the company and also servicing its policy holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.796" offset="630575">Early in 1956, the collective bargaining agreement which covered the terms and conditions of employment of these employees was about to terminate, and as a consequence, the company and the union entered into negotiations for the purpose of arriving at a new agreement to succeed the one which was about to expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.391" offset="708942">After approximately two months of negotiations, the company and the union had failed to arrive at an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.330" offset="736737">And at that time, the union instituted what it called its work without contract program, which I shall describe in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.214" offset="772263">This program continued at the same time that there negotiations between the company and the union were going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.232" offset="800266">It continued for approximately three months and it was called off at the end of the three months when the union informed its membership that it had served its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.884" offset="838928">And shortly thereafter, the company and the union entered into a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.769" offset="862438">Now, this -- under this so called work without contract program that the union instituted for the purpose of applying pressure to the company to yield to its demands, the employees refused to write new business.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.205" offset="924191">The writing of new business, new insurance policies is of course an important function of an insurance agent and of course, it's also an important aspect of any insurance company's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.967" offset="967241">And during this period, approximately seven weeks in duration, during the period that the employees refused to write new business, the company's business -- new business dropped many millions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.460" offset="1013217">At the end of approximately two months, the employees resumed -- resumed writing new business but at least some of the agents, however, refused to follow the procedures which the company had adopted for the orderly processing of this business.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.811" offset="1074657">Normally, the agents would report new business to what is the applications therefore to their district manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.312" offset="1100570">But under the work without contract program, the agents sent these reports and applications directly to the home office.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.370" offset="1128887">Now, the record does not indicate what the effect of this departure from the procedure was, but I suppose there was -- it may have resulted in some amount of confusion in the handling -- in the handling of these reports and applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.736" offset="1186356">Now in addition, under this work without contract program, the employees of -- the employees were directed by their union to ignore the company's working rules and other conditions of their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.500" offset="1241422">Under this program, the employees -- or let me say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.964" offset="1263261">Normally, the employees report to their district officers twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays at 8:30 and normally they leave -- and they report there for purposes of making reports, having conferences, getting instructions and making financial accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.055" offset="1331597">And normally, on Tuesdays, they leave at 9:30 and then they go about their business and again on Friday, they leave at about 11:30 and then they go about their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.143" offset="1371930">But under this program, however, they were instructed by the union not to report on either of these days prior to 10 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.046" offset="1399515">And then, to sit in the office and do as the union described it, and do what comes naturally, and then they would leave in a body, they would leave at a body at 12 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.044" offset="1455522">The further aspects of this program which the union conducted also required the employees to disregard conferences which the company would set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.243" offset="1508394">The company, as part of its training and its sales program, set up -- sets up conferences with the various agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.517" offset="1533471">And under the program, the employees refused to attend any of these conferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.264" offset="1552384">And finally -- finally, as part of this program, the employees, at least during certain hours which would normally be regarded as their working time, engaged in mass demonstrations before the various company officers and in picketing and they also distributed -- they also distributed to the company's policy holders petitions for their signature apparently in a move to embarrass the company in which the policy holders would urge the company to sign a fair contract with its district agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.404" offset="1677040">The union explained the advantages of its program to the -- its membership in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.122" offset="1719881">During the course of the program, the union wrote to its membership saying that the alternative to the union's program is total strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.053" offset="1755617">I'm reading from page 105 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.951" offset="1767215">“The alternative to the union's program is total strike or accepting the company's proposals which would do various things.”</text>
            <text syncTime="422.625" offset="1793860">And then, that letter goes on to say, “It is inconceivable that any member of the union is willing to advocate any of the alternatives in preference to our program.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.661" offset="1830013">While it is true that carrying out the program has its price in sacrifice and inconvenience in the light of the alternatives, the price is small.”</text>
            <text syncTime="439.305" offset="1860629">And again, during the course of this program, the union had adverted to another advantage of the program as compared to its -- compared to the conventional strike action.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.443" offset="1901171">The union wrote to its membership saying, “You know that the company is unhappy because our membership are able to draw their salaries while continuing the program.”</text>
            <text syncTime="458.653" offset="1937951">May I say that during this period of this program was in effect, during which the employees were refusing to perform various important functions of their employment, they were drawing -- they were drawing compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.215" offset="1996257">They were even drawing compensation for a new business because the way the insurance company has -- that the insurance business is setup, the compensation of these employees is based upon what they add in their new business, or the collections that they have made during the preceding quarter.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.596" offset="2057801">And eventually of course, the loss of commissions with respect to new business would be reflected -- would be reflected in the compensation of these agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.898" offset="2095000">But otherwise, otherwise they were drawing their normal compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.887" offset="2114957">Now, the Board found that the union by instigating this program, these tactics, had refused to bargain in good faith within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.907" offset="2166993">The court below relying upon its earlier decision in the Textile Workers Union case which involved similar activities in an industrial plant, exonerated the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.168" offset="2212028">Now, the critical difference I think between the Board on the one hand and the respondent and the court below on the other comes down I believe to this, the court below as well as the respondent union equates these activities, regard these activities as in the nature of partial strikes and that this is those you can not draw as of the inference of subjective bad faith from the use of a conventional strike, so you can draw none from the use of these tactics in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.598" offset="2349746">Now, it is our position that these destructive on the job pressures can not be equated with a strike, that they are inconsistent with the practice and procedures of collective bargaining, which we believe are embedded in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.990" offset="2407320">And that because of that, they constituted a refusal of bargain in good faith within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.513" offset="2437413">Now --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="583.773" offset="2438457">If it had been a strike, there'd been no question here at all, they -- they would have had the right to do that --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="589.471" stopTime="991.300">
            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="589.471" offset="2461236">No, question Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.233" offset="2472312">Now, I think analysis of our problem begins with an understanding and with an examination of the practices and procedures of collective bargaining which we think the statute contemplates.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.258" offset="2516407">As this Court has observed, the statute has absorbed the philosophy of collective bargaining has worked out in the labor movement in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.425" offset="2553083">And that philosophy is incorporated in the statute under the rubric to bargain collectively in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.699" offset="2582131">Now, of course, the duty to bargain collectively in good faith presupposes that the management as well as the representative of the employees will meet and confer in an effort to iron out their differences and to arrive in an agreement through the process of negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.560" offset="2645661">However, Congress realized that the collective bargaining mechanism would not function properly unless they were available to both parties' economic sanctions, because it's fairly obvious that the one party or the other can not either support its own demands with -- with threat of economic sanctions or resist the demands of the other with similar threats that the -- the terms of the collective bargaining agreement will be worked out by the dictate of one party rather than through the process of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.381" offset="2764884">Now, on the employer's side, on the employer's side, the economic sanctions which are available to him are in the final analysis the fact that he controls his business and that he controls the terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.004" offset="2823398">Now, on the employee side, on the employee side, their economic sanctions lie in their right to quit work and to go out on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.588" offset="2869687">Now, the prospect of a strike, the prospect of a strike plays an important role in the negotiations, because each side operates with an awareness of how far it can go in the -- in the course of the negotiations without bringing on a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.289" offset="2936560">And this awareness -- this awareness tempers the relationship and encourages each party that try to arrive in an agreement in terms of -- in the spirit of give and take.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.735" offset="2978356">Now if they are unable to arrive with that agreement, then the employees have their traditional and their classic weapon to quit working and to go out on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.093" offset="3019734">Now, in this scheme -- in this scheme, the strike -- the strike weapon is an essential part of the collective bargaining process which the statute incorporates.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.080" offset="3063724">And this we think -- this we think is the practice and procedure of collective bargaining which is embedded in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.275" offset="3100505">This is evidenced I believe by Section 13 of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.648" offset="3113984">Section 13 of the statute provides that the right to strike shall not be impaired -- shall not be impaired or diminished except as specifically provided in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.179" offset="3160064">Now, in a statute like this one which is designed to encourage industrial peace, it would almost seem like an anomaly to give such special protection to the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.828" offset="3198725">And yet, in the long run, in the long run, the strike weapon serves the basic policies, the basic purposes of the statute, industrial peace for -- with some pretty glaring exceptions that I'm sure we're all familiar with as today, because in the long run, and generally, in the long run, the cost of the strike is such -- is such that it teaches both sides to compromise their differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.451" offset="3297155">Now, let me turn to the tactics that were used here.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.044" offset="3311574">These tactics in our judgment certainly do not occupy, do not occupy the protected -- the privileged position that the strike does in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.069" offset="3347623">And secondly, they do not serve the functions of -- of carrying out the basic policies of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.160" offset="3380015">These activities are the counterpart of the industrial slowdown, the intermittent work stoppage, which this Court dealt with in the Briggs Stratton and Auto Workers case some years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.523" offset="3437484">As the Court observed in that case, activities of this kind do not enjoy the protection that the strike does under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.313" offset="3464652">The employees who are engaged in these activities expose themselves to discharge without recourse to the protection of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.497" offset="3493386">Moreover, although these tactics have not been completely unknown, they have not been regarded as character -- as a characteristic bargaining technique in the American Labor Movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.855" offset="3534764">Indeed, I may say that they have been described -- they have characterized as the diseases of collective bargaining rather than of its nature as the -- as the conventional strike is.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.486" offset="3589308">The -- these tactics we think are no -- are no part of the practice and procedures of collective bargaining which Congress contemplated no part of the practice and procedures on collective bargaining which we think are embedded in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.478" offset="3669243">These -- these tactics they distort -- they distort the play of economic forces that Congress contemplated in order to make the collective bargaining mechanism function properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.226" offset="3716263">The -- these -- these tactics are designed to -- they're designed to, in the sense -- in the sense to compel the employer to subsidize the employees who are unwilling to strike and yet who are unwilling to perform all of their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.119" offset="3807796">Now, of course, from the union's standpoint, from the union's standpoint, this is a very desirable thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.481" offset="3829321">But it is not the play -- it is not the play of the economic forces which Congress contemplated as -- as essential, as necessary to make the collective bargaining mechanism function properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.586" offset="3877700">The conventional strike -- the conventional strike puts both parties under some substantial restraint to come to -- to hammer out -- to hammer out an agreement in the spirit of give and take.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.120" offset="3931826">But, as this Court has noted that pressures which are generated, the pressures which are generated by these disruptive on-the-job pressures are entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.412" offset="3969024">They permit the employees to stay on the job, to receive compensation in whole or at least in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.702" offset="3994206">On the other hand, the employer has to operate his business as though it were operating in its normal fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.947" offset="4019179">And the consequence is, the tendency -- the tendency is that there would be less compulsion upon the union to settle except upon its own terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.389" offset="4060975">And this is not collective bargaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="1002.752" offset="4114369">But, this position was squarely rejected by this Court in the Briggs-Stratton case or Auto Workers' case and it was rejected on the basis of the 1947 legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.762" offset="4158464">It -- in view of the legislative history, it is inconceivable your -- I submit, and as the Court itself found in that case, it is inconceivable that Congress meant to bring activities of this type within the definition of -- of strike for the purpose -- for the purpose of protecting them under Section 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.102" offset="4235786">I think that reading the statute with a saving grace of common sense that the reason -- that these were included, these tactics were included within the definition of strikes was not for the purpose of extending to them the protection of the statute, but rather to bring them within the prohibition of the statute of the 1947 Amendments against secondary strike pressures.</text>

            <text syncTime="1658.131" offset="6735914">Now, I've already called attention by regard as the significant differences between this type of activity and the conventional strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.964" offset="6859212">But more than this, more than this, there is legislative evidence to indicate that Congress did not intend to compass these tactics as a bargaining -- as a bargaining weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.716" offset="6910203">When the 1947 amendments were being considered, the House Bill -- the House Bill had a specific provision which would have made an unfair labor practice of this type of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.262" offset="6952417">The House -- the House was dissuaded -- was dissuaded from insisting upon its position only when it was assure that the courts had held that this kind of activity was outside the pail of the protection of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.359" offset="7008841">And that to particularize -- to particularize this kind of conduct as unfair labor practice might have a very limiting effect upon the Board, upon the Board in dealing with this type of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.832" offset="7054712">And it was this legislative history which prompted this Court in the Jefferson Broadcasting case to say of tactics like this one here, like these here, that these tactics are repugnant -- repugnant to the basic policies of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.037" offset="7111555">Now, given these factors, given these factors, we think it is not unreasonable for the Board to say that it would be in Congress -- that it would be in Congress to permit these activities as it permits -- as a bargaining -- as a bargaining weapon under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.276" offset="7176443">Now, the argument is made that all that the statute requires is that the parties meet and confer in good faith, and that judged by this test, judged by this test, the negotiations between the company and the union satisfy the statutory obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.640" offset="7277902">But we believe that the duty to bargain collectively under the statute involves something more than a sincere desire to reach agreement, that that duty is not discharged, is not satisfied by a mere showing that the parties have met and have sought to compose their differences in a sincere desire to reach agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.228" offset="7360240">We think that the duty to bargain collectively under the statute also embraces a duty to refrain from conduct which is inconsistent with -- with what I've called for lack of a better word, with the mechanics of collective bargaining which the statute contemplates.</text>

            <text syncTime="2011.055" offset="8147571">It is also borne out by Section 8 (b) (3) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.684" offset="8162095">In the Heinz case, which arose under their original Wagner Act, the employer was refusing to memorialize the agreement that he had arrived at with the -- with the union who refused to embody it in a written -- written document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.124" offset="8215907">The Wagner Act, unlike the present statute, did not have a requirement that a collective bargaining agreement be reduced to writing upon party allows other -- the other requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.184" offset="8252061">This Court held that the employer's refusal to memorialize the agreement regardless of a subjective good or bad faith, that the employer's refusal to memorialize that agreement in a written document constituted a refusal of bargaining in the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.190" offset="8316113">The Court said that the reduction of agreement to a written form was the final step for the collective bargaining process that Congress had included this final step into statutory collective bargaining obligation and that the employer's refusal to memorialize it -- memorialize the agreement was infringed -- infringed upon the collective bargaining process that the statute has set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.992" offset="8419349">As similarly in Section 8 (b) (3), I think also have been is a purpose by Congress to do something more than merely to insure a sincere desire to this agreement but named -- but rather to insure an addition -- to insure an addition -- the -- against the impairment of the process by tactics which are normally -- not normally regarded as part of the practice and procedures of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.690" offset="8518092">When Section 8 (b) (3), which makes an unfair labor practice for a union to bargain collectively, was proposed in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.715" offset="8546200">This amendment was opposed on the ground that it was unnecessary, since after all, it was of the unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.650" offset="8565948">It was the business of unions to -- to engage in collective bargaining and to reach agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.533" offset="8601475">Despite this opposition and the alleged superfluity of this amendment, the amendment was enacted and we think it is a fair interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.236" offset="8632299">It is a fair interest that in passing this amendment, Congress sought to insure something more than a sincere desire on part of unions to reach agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.648" offset="8665945">That it sought also to insure as the Wagner Act did it with respect to the employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.622" offset="8685902">They'd also sought to insure against union action which would tend to impair the process of collective bargaining which the statute contemplates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.195" offset="8728116">Now, the argument is also made that if these tactics -- if these tactics disrupt the play of economic forces that Congress contemplated as essential to make the collective bargaining scheme operate that the employer has a quick remedy in his pocket by which he can readdress the imbalance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.755" offset="8870431">The argument is made that the employer, since these activities are not protected by the statute, that the employer can discharge -- can discharge the employees and thereby in effect force them to go out on a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.337" offset="8920691">But, I submit Your Honor that this does not serve the purpose of the statute to compel the employer either to bargain upon the -- under the handicap of this disruptive on-the-job pressures or to force the employees to go out on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.108" offset="8991848">After all, the emphasis of the statute is on peaceful collective bargaining and the purpose of the statute is not served -- it is not served if the alternative which the employer has is either to bargain -- is either to bargain under as I say, the handicap of these pressures or to force the employees to go out on strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="2599.433" offset="10501099">Now, those activities were primarily the not selling of new business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.344" offset="10532760">They included also picketing, they included also late reporting, and they included certain other things.</text>

            <text syncTime="2889.031" offset="11659473">They said, we're not concerned with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2913.071" offset="11755708">It is as though the Board had found that we had in fact bargained in good faith but that there can not be good faith bargaining in theory and that its theory was more important from the fact and we say to Your Honors that that is really what has taken place in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2977.120" offset="12011813">Now, as to the realities, this case involves bargaining which took place for a period of some six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.828" offset="12058728">The parties met on virtually a daily basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.065" offset="12075656">There is no question as to they're meeting the literal requirements of Section 8 (c) that section that Mr. Manoli first referred to in the opening minutes of his argument and then virtually forgot about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.071" offset="12135633">All this is a matter of stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.970" offset="12147231">The bargaining proceeded from on or about January 16, 1956 to July 17, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.852" offset="12178787">The existing contract expired on March 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.040" offset="12203551">The existing contract, as a matter of agreement between the parties, had in the no-strike clause expressly barred the union from using not only complete strikes within the word strike, but also mass late reporting, mass refusal to write new business, picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.441" offset="12293099">Now, the respondent did not engage in any of these activities during the light of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.802" offset="12330611">This bargaining involved debit agents no other category of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.874" offset="12354853">There is no relationship whatsoever or virtually none between the job of a debit agent and that of the factory worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.147" offset="12395917">The duty of the debit agent is to collect, to sell of new business, to services existing policy holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.210" offset="12424234">The debit is an assigned territory or a group of policy holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.232" offset="12448266">Virtually, all of the so-called working time of the agent is out on the field in his own debit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.874" offset="12478882">There is reporting on Tuesday and Friday mornings for a very limited time, as Mr. Manoli indicated, and for a very limited purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.912" offset="12519006">The duties are carried out in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.125" offset="12527888">That is where the premiums are collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.943" offset="12539173">That is where the servicing is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.554" offset="12545546">That is where the new business is sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.114" offset="12555786">Now, in order to sell new business, for example, you have to talk to the prospect who is generally the head of the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.563" offset="12585671">In order to collect premiums, you have to come to the home when the money is there and the people are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.573" offset="12609703">In order to perform this function, therefore, you have to suit the convenience of your client and policy holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.091" offset="12635721">In other words, there is no set working time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.290" offset="12652544">There is no regular working day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.137" offset="12663933">You do the job at whatever hour is convenient and possible for you to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.040" offset="12683577">There is no set prospect of working time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.076" offset="12695698">There is no on-the-job in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.882" offset="12710849">There is no fixed location like a factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.831" offset="12722657">Each man is out on his own debit, doing his own job, on his own schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.175" offset="12740106">And this is conceded as a matter of the undisputed evidence and the undisputed findings of fact by the trial examiner which the Board did not controvert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.968" offset="12787231">Now, the emphasis, in other words, is on results.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.325" offset="12804681">In effect, the company doesn't care when the job gets done so long as it gets done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.077" offset="12823698">And that emphasis on result is reflected in the compensation of these agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.570" offset="12849612">With the exception of a payment of $4.50 a week, everything they get is on a commission basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.751" offset="12882422">When they did not sell new business, they did not earn any new business commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.673" offset="12910111">Now, it is true they are under so called quarterly systems so that their actual earnings were thirteen weeks behind the actual performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.739" offset="12946369">But, they never made up what they lost in terms of not selling business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.341" offset="12964760">In terms of the actual facts of this case, there is no reality whatsoever for saying that there is no pressure upon the employees or upon the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.131" offset="13011884">The not writing of new business had the same economic impact as a complete strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.470" offset="13041246">There was nothing earned where there was nothing sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.901" offset="13054934">There was no compensation where there was performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.604" offset="13069772">To the extent that there was compensation, there was performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.757" offset="13086386">To the extent that there was a collection commission earned, there were collections of premiums made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.928" offset="13115120">Now, the nature of this industry is an important consideration particularly to the question of why this respondent did what it did on March 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.407" offset="13164962">And let met backtrack just for one minute. During the bargaining had developed prior to March 18 that there was one particular issue which brought the parties apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.498" offset="13217416">And that remained true for the balance of the period after March 18 when the work without a contract program was continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.006" offset="13251375">That one issue was a demand by the company not by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.555" offset="13273631">It was a demand by the company for additional contract language with respect to unilateral rights over a debit, over cutting a debit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.388" offset="13312920">Your Honors will recall that I said that a debit was these employees' territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.438" offset="13333086">The cutting of debit had the direct impact of cutting the collection commission, of reducing that minimum of job security of assured income, that is the very distinction between the debit agent and other types of insurance agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.761" offset="13402467">The very point of a debit system, furthermore, is that the agent gets to know the particular people he regularly visits so well that they become his client prospects for new sales, so that both an assured income and a potential prospect, the company was seeking a unilateral right to deprive these agents of fundamental job security so that respondent had before it a most fundamental issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.027" offset="13519496">So that as of March 18 when the contract expired, and when so far as the agreement of the parties is concerned, the union was free to use any other tactics which had been proscribed in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.770" offset="13574457">The union was concerned with what way to bring the most effective economic pressure because of this vital issue of a nature of this industry is completely different so far as the impact on the employer is concerned from a ritual of labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.323" offset="13636629">First of all, if the agents do not collect and no -- and the policy holder does not pay his premium in -- in some other way, the policy will lapse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.808" offset="13678634">If the policy lapses, the company is released from its obligation under the terms of that policy from the duty to pay $10,000 upon death or whatever else that's involved in the particular insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.083" offset="13735685">It does not have to return the accumulated premiums which have been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.091" offset="13759718">So that as a matter of actual reality, the net effect in this industry, unique among industries, is that a withdrawal of labor completely results in income to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.388" offset="13828890">Secondly, there is pressure on the consumer in this industry which is not characteristic of the consumer in any other industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.076" offset="13863685">Where a physical good is involved and a labor dispute takes place, the consumer either postpones his use or purchase of that good or he gets a substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.955" offset="13911228">That is not possible in the case of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.029" offset="13927528">You can not purchase insurance, for example, life insurance at the same price as you purchased it years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.333" offset="13956681">The premium has gone up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.366" offset="13964831">Furthermore, because of changes in health, you may not be able to get the insurance at any price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.477" offset="13989282">Moreover, that policy may have accumulated values in terms of loan or extended insurance or cash values which will be sacrificed if the insurance is not maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.949" offset="14043199">So that this consumer uniquely -- uniquely in the economic picture has a pressure, direct personal pressure, brought against him to continue his payments to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.090" offset="14087711">Now, if that is true, then the company would have in this case received the premiums under the realities of this case and not been obliged to pay the collection commission that our agents not collected it had the policy holders paid it by mail or in some other way and in that way too, the employer would have been ahead financially and have reaped that much of an economic win for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.167" offset="14191992">Those are the realities of this industry of the actual problem confronting this respondent as of March 18, 1956.</text>
