            <label>Ms. Bessie Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- the scope of the production.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.713" offset="130173">It also -- it went further and held that the 1949 amendment to production coverage was intended to exclude construction projects or as local enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.098" offset="211780">We think it's significant that it's admitted here by respondent that if this were -- were just simply to repair or maintain the existing water system that it would still be within the coverage of the Act, as closely related and directly essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.025" offset="319509">At least, I don't understand them to deny that and as I shall later point out the -- the cases, the decisions have long since settled that and the legislative history shows that Congress expressly approved the coverage of -- of maintenance and repair of this type of utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.154" offset="403937">Respondents also assert that they -- they don't put any special -- attach any special importance to the new construction doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.556" offset="449599">I think it's fair to say that they come pretty close to abandoning the Fifth Circuit's reliance on that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.873" offset="486902">They say that certainly, the language, at least the language of Vollmer and Alstate and Lublin should be applied as much to production coverage as in commerce coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.526" offset="537475">And that in general, the liberal construction doctrine should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.226" offset="556283">But they also say that if -- if this were a case where the water -- the dam and reservoir were being constructed solely or primarily for interstate producers and interstate instrumentalities, then they concede that there would be a forceful case for holding that the employees here were closely related and directly essential to production of goods by the producers within the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.073" offset="687626">Their argument turns largely, if not entirely, on their construction of the amendment to the production coverage of the Act in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.156" offset="739976">And respondent like the Court of Appeals below doesn't spend much time on the other grounds on which the District Court upheld coverage the Alstate ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.066" offset="787623">The Court of Appeals dismissed that as -- said -- assumed that the Government wasn't relying on it mistakenly and their only comment was that the employees here certainly weren't producing any goods for commerce when they were construction the dam that they were -- they were simply producing the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.261" offset="880410">Our -- our answer to that is that this is the way you produce waters to construct the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.817" offset="902666">It's an engineering fact that you produce water by constructing a dam and a reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.507" offset="925445">Just like --</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="205.866" offset="926804">You gather water, don't you?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="207.441" stopTime="627.356">
            <label>Ms. Bessie Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="207.441" offset="933177">You impound it and they've -- and -- and producing is very broadly defined in the Act, actual producing it's -- is like you drill -- drill wells for oil or you mine -- dig and mine for coal and that this is as much producing water as the mining of coal is producing coal of a digging -- drilling of oil wells is producing oil so that the -- we don't need to minimize that ground of coverage when we direct most of our brief in answering the arguments of the Court of Appeals and respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.338" offset="1100675">They do not give any answer to that and that is still, we think, a -- a sufficient basis of coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.613" offset="1137873">Coming though to there -- in -- to the interpretation of the legislative history of the 1949 amendment to production, the Court of Appeals said that it didn't have to look to the legislative history to decide that Congress intended to expand the local enterprises that it was removing from the Act and it obviously assumed that what it did was to extract a part of the reasoning from this Court's office building case in Callus and relating to the performing activities of -- of rendering services for a miscellany of customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.948" offset="1343195">And relying heavily on -- on that reference to Callus, the Court said that this type of service to a miscellany of customers was intended to be excluded as local enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.216" offset="1416234">And this, in effect, is respondents' argument as I think is evident from their -- from their admission that if -- if this facility was designed primarily as solely deserved interstate producers and interstate instrumentalities, then it could forcefully be contended that the employees were covered as closely related and directly essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.866" offset="1522813">Both the Court of Appeals and respondents' argument rest on the assumption that it was a legislative intent in 1949 to very substantially curtail the scope of coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.221" offset="1592299">They -- respondents said so in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.673" offset="1614033">Now, he -- respondent does look to some of the legislative history just the House Report and only parts of the House Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.440" offset="1653112">The Court of Appeals below didn't look at any of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.097" offset="1679757">Respondents, however, interpret what legislative history they looked at in the same way that apparently the court below interpreted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.159" offset="1732002">And I did want to say a word in answer to the Court of Appeals reliance on the new construction doctrine since the Court clearly relied pretty heavily on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.924" offset="1779022">It was the only basis on which it differed from the Eighth Circuit in the Chambers case, where the Eighth Circuit had pointed out that the Vollmer decision didn't establish anything new, it was just asserting the principle that had applied generally to the Act's coverage, and that this type of improvement are enlargement of an existing facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.112" offset="1891871">It had always been ruled within the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.893" offset="1914964">That original construction which had previously been thought to be by some outside the scope of that -- of the Act in which the administrator had earlier thought might be a basis for determining coverage on this Act meant something quite different from improvement and enlargement or expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.072" offset="2007646">Now, the Fifth Circuit obviously treated this as new construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.708" offset="2022170">And our position is that whatever remains of the new construction doctrine in either phase of coverage, it clearly -- this Court's rulings have established that this does not apply to an improvement or an enlargement or -- or an expansion if that falls in the same category as repair and maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.021" offset="2131466">Now, there is nothing in the legislative history at all to -- relating to new construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.620" offset="2173889">The legislative reports did make clear both House and Senate reports stated in no uncertain terms that it was not the intent to make any drastic change in -- in the scope of coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.282" offset="2260511">The House Report, I should point out that there was a divergence of -- between the House and Senate proposals originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.935" offset="2303143">The Senate didn't want to make any change in the definition of coverage, production coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.532" offset="2329475">The House had proposed a more drastic language of closely related and indispensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.242" offset="2360299">The language, if the Act is enacted was a -- a compromise, and the reports of the Senate and House, I think, are the best evidence of what that compromise was intended to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.076" offset="2435636">The House Committee Report stated explicitly, the amended section gives the courts a more specific guide as to the intention of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.987" offset="2475342">It does not, however, radically revise the coverage of the Act as it has been interpreted by the courts in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.624" offset="2505853">And this -- and the Senate conferees report also stated that it was not intended to substantially change and limit the decisions construing the prior necessary to production language but rather to provide more certainty in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.821" offset="2570637">And the Senate report specifically stated that the amended language adopts the standard of closely related which the Supreme Court has supplied in most of its decisions interpreting coverage.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="627.356" offset="2612746">Are those quoted in your brief?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="629.114" stopTime="1204.235">
            <label>Ms. Bessie Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="629.114" offset="2619852">On page 45 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.285" offset="2636466">And then the Senate report went on and said that the amendatory language is descriptive of activities which although not an integral part of productive operations have a relationship to production which may reasonably be considered close as distinguished from a remote entanglers and contemplates activities which are directly a production in a practical sense by providing something essential to carrying on in an effective, efficient and satisfactory manner of operations which are a part of an integrated effort for the production of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.319" offset="2776691">Now, we say that that language comes very close to the test this Court has established for determining whether activities are within the in commerce coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.487" offset="2833324">In the Vollmer case, the Court stated that the test was whether the work is so directly and vitally related to the functioning of an instrumentality or facility of interstate commerce as to be in practical effect a part of it rather than isolated local activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.951" offset="2907199">And in the Lublin case, I'm relating to the plans and specifications for improvement of interstate instrumentalities, the Court say -- stated that it was whether the work is directly and vitally related to the functioning of those interstate facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.285" offset="2968534">Now, that language, I think -- we think parallel so closely the -- the Senate and House or the legislative statements as to what they intended by this closely related and directly essential language that it follows that work which is just as vitally and directly and closely related to production of goods for commerce as where the lock in dams and -- and the lock in dam and the lock in canal and the plans and specifications in the Vollmer and Lublin cases that there's no more reason for more restrictive they are -- more restrictive interpretation of the production coverage as amended in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.253" offset="3180335">Now, the -- prior to 1949 as the Eighth Circuit pointed out, it was settled that the production coverage was much more flexible and broader than the in commerce coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.550" offset="3249612">So that the position of respondent and of the court below is that by the 1949 amendment, Congress reversed the situation that production coverage now is not even coextensive with the in commerce coverage that it's narrower and more rigid.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.914" offset="3343026">In addition to the general statements in both House and Senate reports stating that they did not intend to have such a drastic change in their scope of production -- production coverage, the specific cases were mentioned -- were listed in both reports more in the Senate than in the House state -- stating what they specifically did not intend to change as to the scope of production coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.731" offset="3470294">And significantly, most significantly among those cases were the public utility cases producing and supplying electricity, gas, fuel, water, specifically mentioning water among those, the manufacturing of tools and dies and machinery to be used by other producers of goods and production of other goods for commerce and custodial and maintenance service furnished by an independent firm that might be serving customers generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.581" offset="3609684">In fact all of these -- these -- in these three areas which both House and Senate reports endorsed and stated specifically would remain within the coverage of the Act, our typical examples of -- of facilities serving a general miscellany of customers but also well-known to be vitally essential -- vitally and substantially essential to the production of any goods for commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.419" offset="3737057">Ignoring all of these specific examples approved by both Houses, respondent relies primarily if not entirely on a few examples in the House Report which the House said it understood that the language would exclude from the coverage in two cases that respondents rely on, particularly the Super-A Fertilizer case and which was a decision of the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.734" offset="3882297">I might point out that except for the window washing case, neither House nor Senate report disapproved any decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.505" offset="3925347">They specifically approved the test of Kirschbaum.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.514" offset="3937468">They said they intended -- both Houses said they intended to adopt the immediate -- close and immediate trial test of Kirschbaum.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.906" offset="3971009">And -- that only -- not the Senate but the House said that it objected to holding at an industrial window washing company was within the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.818" offset="4026598">Now, the -- in strictest logic some of the things the -- the House said would be excluded by the language if you apply it in constrict logic, it might be hard to reconcile those cases with the cases they explicitly said they intended to remain within the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.824" offset="4110712">But the -- certainly, that is no grounds for overwriting the joint intent as to the types of cases, both Houses intended to retain under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.432" offset="4161076">And there certainly no reason for extending those cases, beyond what even the House suggested, they should go in order to narrow the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.454" offset="4209142">Moreover, the cases are distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.279" offset="4220531">The Super-A Fertilizer case was the production of fertilizer used by farmers to produce sugarcane -- to fertilize the soil for production of sugarcane.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.429" offset="4273089">And it's hard to reconcile that with a specific approval of the Reynolds water case which the Senate report specifically said they intended to endorse and would continue within the coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.905" offset="4327006">But apparently, the -- they could be reconciled and are distinguishable on the basis that fertilizer, although useful in the production of goods is not thought to be as vitally essential as water and fuel and electricity and gas and heat and tools and dies and machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.359" offset="4412792">The other case on which respondent relies and which is cited in the House Report is the Schroeder case, the production -- the quarrying of rock for the construction of a dike which was to protect an oil field from being flooded by a government project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.682" offset="4494085">The respondent emphasizes that case because he says it's like this one because it's a construction of a dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.279" offset="4520521">But the -- the purposes are obviously quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.652" offset="4537971">But apart from that, it's significant that the House Report just says they disapproved of holding the quarry employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.797" offset="4570572">The employees quarrying the rock and significantly, did not say that they disapproved of covering the employees engaged in the actual construction of the dike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.073" offset="4615711">And of course, we are concerned here with the employees engaged in the actual construction of this dam and reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.161" offset="4663986">The window washing case in the same way -- in fact all of these -- all of these supplies and materials, the fertilizer and the rock and window washing could be said to be services or supplies which are not vitally essential to the productive process whereas plainly water, live electricity, gas and -- and coal and fuel and tools and dies and machinery is absolutely vital and essential to the production to -- of any goods for interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.718" offset="4902222">We want to spend a few minutes on the injunction point and then reserve --</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="1204.235" offset="4920299">Could I ask you one question?</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.470" offset="4925210">What do you conceive to be the strongest case in your favor that's been decided by this Court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="1214.298" stopTime="1715.064">
            <label>Ms. Bessie Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="1214.298" offset="4960528">I conceive our strongest argument to be that the utility cases that Congress expressly approved cases like the Florida Power and Light, the -- also the McCrady case which was a new -- construction of new plants for an existing steel company and some of these were new plants and was related to that particular company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.620" offset="5105873">I think the utility cases, the maintenance and repair cases and the custodial cases and the West Kentucky-Florida Power and Light, the coal company, gas case and electric cases and the Reynolds Water and Farmers Reservoir cases which were approved by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.608" offset="5193853">Now, those were cases where the water was being furnished to exclusively, almost exclusively for farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.908" offset="5231052">But our point is that obviously that was not the -- a determinative factor with Congress in approving these cases because the general utilities do not furnish exclusively or even primarily to industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.205" offset="5300224">In this case, it's submitted that some 40% to 50% of this water supply, of the existing water supply was devoted to industrial uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.481" offset="5341288">And that practically, all the industrial users in Corpus Christi produced goods for interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.554" offset="5365635">And it's been settled and generally and consistently held and, as I say, the legislative history of that 1949 amendment approved it obviously that it's the substantial and regular need and use of the facility for interstate commerce and not that it must be primarily or solely devoted to that use that invokes the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.585" offset="5457690">So that I say that all these utility cases and the repair and maintenance holding, that the repair and maintenance and protection of utilities, facilities that unless you adopt a new construction give the broad interpretation to the new construction doctrine and apply it technically, you cannot distinguish this between the repair, maintenance and protection of the existing facility which has been consistently held covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.537" offset="5593527">That the fact that it's a large and a big -- a big plant and a large construction project does not make it any less closely related or directly essential to supplying that absolutely essential and directly necessary facility for the production of goods for commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.763" offset="5678373">And that the same principles of the -- we -- we rely on the principles of the of Vollmer and Lublin case and with respect to the practical considerations which show that this is vital and essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.494" offset="5753396">And that what is vital and essential to the functioning of interstate instrumentalities under those decisions is equally closely related and directly essential to the production of goods for commerce under the production coverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.384" offset="5836884">And that or neither the court below nor respondent has taken issue with -- with the fact that -- that this water supply is just as closely related and directly essential and vital to the producers of goods for commerce and interstate instrumentalities as was the construction of the lock and canal in -- in Vollmer to the interstate traffic on that water-way or the plans and specifications in Lublin were to the interstate uses of the instrumentalities there being improved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.345" offset="5996753">No issue has been taken with the -- with practical fact that the relationship and the -- and the vital essentiality of this water supply is equally close and direct as -- as the facilities in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.517" offset="6073448">Coming then to the injunction point, we recognize, of course, that the issuance of injunctive relief is largely discretionary with the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.098" offset="6127783">But we believe this case illustrates that what is becoming or something of a problem in the lower courts particularly in this region where most the violations of -- large proportion have been appear that they're taking a mistaken view of the purpose and nature of the injunction and thus really obstructing enforcement and compliance rather than encouraging it or helping to deter violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.481" offset="6253275">The attitude has been that the employer should be absolutely unfettered in -- in contesting doubtful coverage questions, questions which he in good faith thinks may be doubtful or if he relies in good faith on advice of -- of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.730" offset="6338330">And that this is sufficient reason not to give any relief and in effect relief was denied here because that one project was virtually completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.466" offset="6393187">This attitude, we think, just encourages employers to contest and litigate or take or decide not to comply until they have an opportunity to litigate because they have absolutely nothing to lose not even the -- they can be even pretty sure they're not going to be enjoined for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.977" offset="6479287">And meanwhile, they're underpaying their employees if it's later determined that they held covered -- covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.384" offset="6508857">And they stand to retain in -- permanently, again they acquired during -- during this period if they're litigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.546" offset="6553579">Well, it is true that the Congress in Section 17 when it denied the courts the power to grant restitution for past violations apparently, intended to give the employer at least one bite of the -- the apple free if he wants to contest coverage, then they would leave it just to the employee remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.803" offset="6662562">But in enacting that provision, Congress made it clear that it was not saying that in a contempt action, the Court couldn't compel compliance by ordering past payment of wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.889" offset="6718882">But the only way that the Court can really compel that type of compliance is if it first issues an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.108" offset="6747826">Now, the courts have also said something about employ -- employers should not be required to act if they're peril to -- in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.600" offset="6797772">And this is what they conceive the injunction is doing apparently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.277" offset="6816475">Well, all of the -- I think they overlook the peculiar nature of the injunction under this Act which is not like and extraordinary equity injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.177" offset="6852106">It requires nothing except that they comply with what the Act -- the duties the Act imposes on them in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.561" offset="6881573">And they're not subject to any peril of criminal contempt if they in good faith believe they are not covered -- it -- because criminal contempt has to be a willful violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.236" offset="6932355">And they have every opportunity to present to the Court after an injunction has been issued any doubtful coverage questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3719.659" offset="14982040">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.517" offset="15001475">In view of the colloquy which has just ensued the temptation is strong to again discussing immediately the question of the scope of the injunction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.189" offset="15044106">However, Mr. Johnson and I have reached a draft apportionment whereby subject to questions of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.446" offset="15073155">I was to discuss primarily the question of coverage which, of course, is the fair amount question as far as we're concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.987" offset="15103352">And again, subject to the questions of the Court, he proposes to deal with the injunctive feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.595" offset="15129788">So I will mention at the beginning, the question of coverage in this case which we feel is a most serious one and certainly is, by no means, as clear as counsel for the Government has indicated that she believes it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.817" offset="15202617">Now, we start and we've tried to start throughout this litigation with the proposition as this Court has several times stated that in a coverage case of this kind, the problem that faces all of us, that faces the Court in rendering its decisions, that faces those of us in private practice in advising our clients, our -- our joint problem, our mutual problem is to try to decide where to draw the line in these coverage cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.968" offset="15327274">And this Court, of course, has observed in the past that looking for a dependable touchstone as a guide in attempting to draw that line is, as I think the Court put it, about as rewarding as attempting to square the circle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.272" offset="15400417">We have no quick answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.166" offset="15408044">We have no easy answer to urge upon the Court as far as coverage is concerned under the facts of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.908" offset="15438973">All that we think we can do is to marshal to the Court, as we've tried to do in our briefs and as I shall try to do in argument, the factors which we think will assist us and assist the Court in drawing the line of coverage in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.945" offset="15507101">And we began, of course, in setting both -- for those factors with the actual facts in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.854" offset="15534791">We have a dam here built on a non-navigable river located solely within the boundaries of the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.021" offset="15571466">The dam was not constructed for flood control purposes unlike other dams that have been before this Court in other context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.758" offset="15606366">It was not constructed to aid navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.985" offset="15619323">No federal funds were used in the construction of the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.656" offset="15633951">The dam produces no hydroelectric energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.367" offset="15648789">It's merely a dam on the Nueces River approximately 42 miles above the City of Corpus Christi which was built by the respondent here in the H. B. Zachry Company pursuant to contract between it and the Lower Nueces River Water Supply District.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.410" offset="15724962">And the actual outline contractually speaking and also physically speaking of the facts in the case are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.654" offset="15766026">Zachry, the respondent contracted with the District for the construction of the dam and built the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.990" offset="15791313">And of course the activities of his employees in constructing the dam are what are before this Court for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.716" offset="15822242">The District in turn and the District is no coextensive with the City of Corpus Christi and under the laws of the State of Texas, the District is an entirely different animal than a municipality such as the City of Corpus Christi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.715" offset="15882219">The District entered into a contract whereby it agreed to sell to the city the water impounded by the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.657" offset="15917955">And as far as the flow of the water is concerned, once my client, the respondent built the dam, once his employees left the scene, water began to be impounded and is still being impounded behind the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.178" offset="15980126">When that water is impounded, it's the property of the District.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.420" offset="15997053">But the District has, by contract, sold it to the City of Corpus Christi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.154" offset="16015966">And as water is released through this dam, it's metered, the City takes title there, that water is discharged into the bed of the Nueces River where it flows down the old riverbed 26 miles downstream to a little town called Calallen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.302" offset="16088586">And the City of Corpus Christi has constructed a treatment plant, a purification plant at Calallen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.098" offset="16115754">The water goes through the treatment plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.695" offset="16126203">It then goes downstream another 16 miles for a total of 42 miles where it enters in to the old distribution system, water distribution system of the City of Corpus Christi.</text>
            <text syncTime="4018.104" offset="16175835">And once it enters that distribution system and is sold and distributed by the -- the City, it sold, of course, to the usual miscellany of customers that any sizeable city sells water to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.688" offset="16230170">And among those customers are numerous industries in the City of Corpus Christi which use water in connection with the production of goods which they manufacture for commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4046.691" offset="16290147">So, we have a question here whether a basic question, the -- the Government has -- has interjected a few tangential factors but basically, this lawsuit begin with this question, and I think it's the principle question now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.007" offset="16351378">The question is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.826" offset="16358693">When respondent's employees built the dam up the Nueces River, were they, in some way, performing some kind of activity which was tied so closely to the production of goods for commerce by the manufacturing plants in Corpus Christi as to make it possible for the courts to say that the workers upon that dam were, in fact, connected with the production of goods for commerce and that therefore, coverage should obtain under the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="4680.431" offset="18825070">The only support the Government confined for that argument that that our workers were really producing water and that the water itself was the good lies in the fact that in a bunch of string citations which it gave on -- on an elementary proposition, the trial court cited this Court's decision in the Alstate case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4729.424" offset="19021093">If we use those tests and if we assume that it is practical to say that in building a dam, we are producing water.</text>

            <text syncTime="4756.821" offset="19130702">And if the Court will look at the only portion of the record on that point which is set forth verbatim in our brief in a footnote on page 44, the only evidence on the point was that nobody knew of any case where water becomes an ingredient in any product.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.199" offset="19196217">And as a matter of fact, the -- the counsel for the Government, they even interjected a helpful quip there to the effect that he didn't know of any at least in the case of petroleum products.</text>

            <text syncTime="4912.946" offset="19755133">I have no hesitancy in saying that as far as logic and rationale are concerned, we rely strongest upon the decision of this Court in the Callus case which was another one of the building cases following upon the hills of -- of Kirschbaum and Borella.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.234" offset="19828276">And we think the -- the Callus case ties directly in to what was accomplished by the 1949 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.424" offset="19861086">And since I haven't mentioned those amendments yet, I'd like to get to them now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4944.267" offset="19880417">As the Court notes, prior to 1949, in the case involving goods -- production of goods for commerce where the activity in question was, as we think is true in this case, not an activity involving actual production but rather if it was anything at all was an activity in a closely -- in a related process or occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.031" offset="19995460">Where that type of situation was before the courts prior to 1949, the portion of the Act which governed that situation said that the activity was covered if it was in a related process or occupation necessary to the production of goods for commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4994.763" offset="20082395">And of course, under the necessary test, although this Court said that not everything that was indispensable was necessary, certainly, under the necessary language, there were reasons for extending the bounds of coverage quite broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.290" offset="20160554">I believe one of the judges some years ago complained saying that the extensions were getting to the point where under the necessary tests, it was like tossing a pebble into a pond, and then because of the infinite ripples that went out saying that -- that everything that occurred beyond the point of impact was in -- in some way caused by the pebble.</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.125" offset="20251878">It's certainly under the necessary language, there was a basis for this Court and the lower courts saying that coverage was quite broad in these related occupation or process cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.744" offset="20298376">However, in 1949, Congress by deliberate act inserted the word "closely" before the words "related process or occupation" and deleted the word “necessary” and substituted therefore the words “directly essential”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.670" offset="20374026">With the result since 1949, that portion of the statute has provided that coverage obtains only where the activity in question is in a closely related process or occupation directly essential to the physical production of goods for commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="5089.282" offset="20460544">The Callus case was decided under the old necessary case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5092.748" offset="20474337">And yet, we think we've learned much from the language of the Callus case even -- even under the old test.</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.276" offset="20500459">And certainly, the -- the logic there employed we think becomes even more pertinent under the 1949 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.042" offset="20531493">In the Callus case, for example, this Court said that remoteness of a particular activity from the physical process of manufacturing while not decisive of the question is certainly a relevant factor to aid in drawing the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.208" offset="20600247">And if remoteness was a relevant factor even under the necessary test, we think it's even more a -- a relevant factor under the closely related and directly essential test.</text>
            <text syncTime="5136.159" offset="20647999">Now, the Government has argued both in brief and here today that actually, the 1949 amendments with this change in language were of but little effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5148.164" offset="20696064">The Department of Labor has not said so in its own regulations on the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.901" offset="20718947">In the regulation which we've quoted at the bottom of page 79 of our brief and at the top of page 80, the Labor Department itself has said that the legislative history shows that the new language, and I'm quoting here, “In the final clause of Section 3 (j) of the Act is intended to narrow and to provide a more precise guide to the scope of its coverage in exactly the type of case that we have here at the bar."</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.259" offset="20832423">The Fifth Circuit, I mean the Fifth Circuit of course in our case has so construed the -- the 1949 amendments, but in addition to the fact that the Fifth Circuit has construed these amendments as having a limited effect, the Sixth Circuit has so construed them in Mitchell versus Moore, which we have cited and -- and discussed in our brief, and the 1949 amendments have been given such a construction also by the Seventh and the Tenth Circuits in two additional cases which we referred to as the hospital cases in their briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="5247.144" offset="21091976">And I might add, he goes further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5249.542" offset="21101589">He says some employees whose work might meet the necessary test are now outside the coverage of the Act because their work is not closely related and directly essential to such production.</text>
            <text syncTime="5262.313" offset="21152580">We are willing to meet him in his own arena.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.792" offset="21166582">On that point, we think that the 1949 amendments were written into the Act purposefully that they should be given effect and that their effect, as applied to this case, is simply that when our employees were out on the dam building that dam, they were too remote to be considered as being in an occupation or process closely related and directly essential to the production of goods for commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="5337.026" offset="21451525">Now, we -- we can take it for granted, I assume, that dams don't build themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="5341.844" offset="21470751">And so in someway, somehow, it was before building the dam.</text>

            <text syncTime="5781.912" offset="23230986">I had prepared to make a few remarks in connection with the injunction feature but in the light of the questions that were propounded from the bench, I'm going to make them very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.024" offset="23283440">Now, I do hope to say this at the outset that my -- my colleague here we subscribe to the statement contained in the -- the Kirschbaum case that, and I'm footnoting Mr. Moorhead's statement with the permission of the Court that we do subscribe to the statement in Kirschbaum versus Walling that to search for this dependable touchstone is by which to determine coverages as we -- rewarding as the attempt to square the circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5828.283" offset="23416456">Now, we, therefore, recognize the problem -- the test that is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5835.892" offset="23446967">And -- but however, we feel and sincerely feel that the problem here presented in this case, in the case at bar, is a little further removed from any other case that has thus far been presented to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5851.214" offset="23508198">And we start, of course, with the building of a dam of a local stream in the State of Texas which when completed will impound water which will in turn to be sold to a municipal corporation which will in turn sell and distribute that water to a miscellany of some 200,000 people among whom are some little and thus some large industrial consumers who, in turn, produce goods for commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5879.053" offset="23619584">Now, there is a considerable distance between the building of the dam and the actual production of goods for commerce, and I think Mr. Moorhead has covered that very nicely.</text>

          <turn speaker="chester_h_johnson" startTime="5922.458" stopTime="6284.662">
            <label>Mr. Chester H. Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="5922.458" offset="23793246">-- that we have cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="5923.927" offset="23799097">And I want to direct the Court's attention to page 72 of petitioner's brief wherein the McComb versus Jacksonville Paper Company case is cited for the proposition -- I believe it is cited from the proposition that a mere violation of the Act of the -- of the Fair Labor Standards Act entitles the -- the petitioner to an injunction without further redo.</text>
            <text syncTime="5952.684" offset="23914141">The point I want to make here is that the -- the Jacksonville Paper Company case was strictly -- it wasn't a contempt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5961.801" offset="23950608">And there is simply -- there is simply a great distinction between a hearing on a contempt order than a hearing or an application for an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5974.756" offset="24002435">Now, further pursuing the point, petitioner cites this Court to the Union Tool Company and the Overnight Motor Company case at pages, I believe, at 67 or 68 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5989.566" offset="24061680">Likewise, the Union Tool Company case was -- it was a contempt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5995.592" offset="24085713">Now, it issued out of a patent infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5998.450" offset="24097207">And the -- the Overnight Motor Company case was a liquidated damage case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6004.109" offset="24119777">The employee, the facts being clear, the employee was entitled to recover the liquidated damages as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6012.522" offset="24153422">There -- there was nothing left in either of those cases for the Court's discretion to be applied to the facts were clear so that it was more or less mandatory that remedial relief follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="6024.835" offset="24202742">It only had to do was to draw the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="6027.818" offset="24214653">Further pursuing the point, petitioner would cite the Court, and I'm trying to group these cases rather than to take them -- as I've cited them on numerous cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.106" offset="24255822">So I'm just going to talk about two cases, I believe, that -- that were injunction cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6044.305" offset="24280586">The -- for instance, we cite the (Inaudible) case out of the Fifth Circuit, the Circuit which is so condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="6053.255" offset="24316426">And that was a -- a child labor violation case, a very flagrant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6059.889" offset="24342967">The only reason the -- the trial court did not wrap the injunction was that he believe the defendant to be a law-abiding citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="6070.352" offset="24384763">And he didn't believe that he would violate the law anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="6075.011" offset="24403466">The Fifth Circuit said, “That's not sufficient to withhold the grace of the Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6079.751" offset="24422379">That injunction should issue -- had so many further excuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="6083.654" offset="24437948">In that connection, the petitioner cites another injunction case called the -- the Walling versus Youngerman-Reynolds Hardwood Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6095.072" offset="24483610">And -- and another with like case was Southwest Engineers case which is a very recent one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6101.195" offset="24508165">And they hold to -- as about the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6104.453" offset="24521226">Now, further pursuing the point in there's -- for you to overcome the decision of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6111.755" offset="24550379">They condemned the Hodges case and they condemned the -- the Bland case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6116.299" offset="24568560">Now, the Hodges case reminds me very much of -- of the situation that we are confronted with.</text>
            <text syncTime="6122.112" offset="24591862">There, Hodges was a contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.481" offset="24601266">He had 11 -- he performed 1100 contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6128.977" offset="24619238">The administrator selected five of those contracts to test.</text>
            <text syncTime="6133.513" offset="24637419">The trial court found that -- that three of those cases, there was no coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6141.271" offset="24668453">That -- I believe that three, that there was no coverage and two that they were -- that there was coverage or may -- might have been vice versa, but an appeal was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="6150.896" offset="24706905">The court though withheld the injunction, did not grant it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6154.016" offset="24719444">In that connection, the -- the defendant had a labor counselor who it had hired from -- that used to work for the -- for the Labor Department or the Wage and Hour Department to counsel with it to help it to -- along its way to keep to -- keep down the infractions of the labor laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="6178.036" offset="24815470">So that case -- those cases, in other words, the -- the -- are in keeping with the general trend or the general line of decisions of all the courts that say that -- that if the facts are clear and if the cause has been shown, he maybe entitled to his injunction absent any mitigating factors, but it's usually always within the discretion of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6204.639" offset="24921945">Now, I want to point to page 73 of petitioner's brief, and I'm going to conclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="6214.161" offset="24959979">They complained that bitterly of the prohibitive cost of carrying on the program and maintaining a constant vigilance over these employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6226.609" offset="25009821">I especially point to that in the light of the record and the record here shows that -- that respondent had a legal department and it also has, in its employer, pages 64 and 65 of the record, a man whose job it is to police all jobs in an effort to keep the -- the workers on the payroll in a proper classification even under Davis-Bacon and Walsh-Healey as well as the Fair Labor Standards Act, and to minimize any infractions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6263.126" offset="25155897">Now, in spite -- in spite of all these efforts, they say that they need a broad blanket injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6272.629" offset="25193932">I'm going to agree with them that it is costly program.</text>
            <text syncTime="6276.013" offset="25207411">I'm further saying that -- that we're doing our part to minimize that cost and we're doing the best we can.</text>
            <text syncTime="6284.250" offset="25240325">Thank you.</text>
