            <label>Mr. Eberhard P. Deutsch</label>
            <text syncTime="15.796" offset="166536">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.587" offset="177716">At the very outset, permit me to state that this case involves no mandates.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.765" offset="206451">This was an order entered by the District Court for the transfer of an action and in the same order, brought the case within the new Interlocutory Appeals Act so that the case came to the Court of Appeals on appeal and then here by certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.908" offset="278967">There is no mandamus status involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.254" offset="300387">The proceeding itself involves an action in rem in admiralty instituted on the Southern District of New York of -- in the Eastern District of Louisiana against a vessel present in that district.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.319" offset="360678">The cause of action had arisen in the Western District of Tennessee where the libel in rem could not have been brought but where a companion action at law was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.618" offset="413863">The District Court held that the convenience of parties and witnesses in the interest of justice required it to be transferred to the Western District of Tennessee, rather the right to -- or made the statement that the question involved was one of importance and of doubtful solution and an appeal was accordingly allowed to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.594" offset="517726">That Court affirmed, holding expressly that an action in rem in admiralty maybe transferred to a district "to which the movement consents to an unlimited submission of the cause."</text>
            <text syncTime="123.525" offset="597452">It had been my intention to suggest that very little could be added at this point to what has been said at this bar in the two preceding cases but I am tempted to depart from that original intention a step or two to answer perhaps one or two questions which I think were not answered directly at this bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.693" offset="698180">In the first place, the question was asked what would happen, I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter, if the plaintiff had in his pocket a letter granting consent to the filing of an action in a district in which it could not otherwise have been filed, if he had that in his pocket prior to the filing of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.250" offset="788355">Now that, I don't think that question was answered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.158" offset="811969">I don't know that I can answer it under the holdings of the Seventh Circuit that would still not be a district in which the action could be filed because they read that clause as stating where it might have been brought in the absence of any assent or waiver from the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.378" offset="936835">We recognize of course that venue maybe waived under proper circumstances but we do not think it can be waived in a forum in which an action has not and could not have been properly brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.560" offset="989602">The -- when Congress provided for the transfer of a case to a district where it might have been brought, it meant the district where plaintiff had a recognized right to bring his case under the Venue Act and that this right was unqualified and absolute not depending upon consent of the defendant, evidenced by waiver, entry of appearance or otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.901" offset="1150934">The other case, the other Seventh Circuit case which is up here contains similar language, not as strong as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.966" offset="1183222">Now, with reference to the matter of Josephson, in that case, Judge Magruder held in so many words that even the waiver wasn't necessary once you got the defendant and that as far as I can see with all due deference simply just reads where it might have been brought right out of the statute altogether because the argument which is made “where it might have been brought” by waiver or consent isn't even there anymore.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.616" offset="1329821">In In re Josephson and perhaps to avoid any question, let me read two or three lines and then make my comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.609" offset="1369840">One service of process upon all the defendants has been effectuated in Massachusetts, a transfer order.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.411" offset="1397008">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.713" offset="1402232">An order of transfer under Section 1404 (a) sends the case as is to the transferee court with no need of a new service of process upon the defendants after the case reaches the Court in Mexico, in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.287" offset="1460537">Therefore, in the case before us, it was probably superfluous that the defendants formally waived any question of personal jurisdiction over them in New Mexico.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.265" offset="1544443">Now, we -- we both have to guess in what Judge Magruder meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.989" offset="1555310">I suppose -- but I understood him to mean this venue in the sense -- and I don't understand it either in that sense, this venue in the sense that the Court would normally have jurisdiction of this kind of an action and it doesn't make any difference whether you can serve in there or not, serve them in your transferor district then transfer your case and pay no attention to the phrase “where it might have been brought”.</text>

            <text syncTime="385.384" offset="1644857">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.532" offset="1649455">He had a case involving I think a derivative action against some, I think nine of his 14 defendants could've been sued in New Mexico and the other -- I mean in New Mexico, the other five could not, could be sued only in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.601" offset="1725733">But be that as it may, the motion may necessarily import by implication a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.878" offset="1750915">In our case, the motion to transfer says nothing whatever on the subject, just a motion to transfer, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.814" offset="1778604">There is no waiver, no express waiver of any kind in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.082" offset="1795741">Now this, bare in mind, is an action in rem in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.551" offset="1817579">We submit of course that affirmance of the two preceding cases necessarily reverses ours, not without regardless the difference in the type of proceeding but we also submit and that is the only further point to which I will address myself that even should those cases be reversed, this case from the Fifth Circuit must be reversed because of the difference in the nature of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.602" offset="1921755">One of the arguments made by the respondent in this Court is that the admiralty court has an inherent power independently of the statute and under Rule 44 of the Admiralty Rules of this Court to effect such a transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.406" offset="2005034">We submit that no such power exist certainly in contravention of the specific provisions of the statute dealing with “Any civil action which it has been held and which clearly includes admiralty causes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="493.060" offset="2075564">A proceeding in rem maybe instituted only in the district in which the race can be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.165" offset="2103986">We do submit that that approaches a jurisdictional -- if it does not enter the field of a jurisdictional requirement as opposed to one of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.373" offset="2148916">It is a proceeding in rem as such only within the district in which the race may lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.972" offset="2187264">In admiralty, such a proceeding maybe brought against the vessel even though no personal action would lie against the owner of the vessel, as for instance, in cases of non-contract salvage, in compulsory pilot cases, in cases of bareboat charters modernly, in cases in which a vessel has been transferred and the lien follows the vessel against the vessel but not against the new owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.493" offset="2317354">In such a proceeding, the jurisdiction of the Court is not personal over the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.492" offset="2345357">He is merely a sort of ancillary party.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.238" offset="2360299">He's not actually a party to the litigation, no personal judgment can be rendered against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.341" offset="2384750">He merely comes in and claims his vessel if he files a bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.275" offset="2404498">That bond stands in place of the vessel but no personal action maybe rendered against the claimant except of course under the bond if he gives one and signs it.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.596" offset="2453713">The claimant under vessel therefore, we submit only this, may not move under Section 1404 (a) to transfer because his motion in a sense is not -- could not even constitute a waiver in behalf of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.789" offset="2530513">He is not a party to the litigation and he cannot constitute the district to which a removal is sought one in which the action might have been brought because that applies only to one in which the race is to be found.</text>

            <text syncTime="623.218" offset="2596237">Is -- for my information, tell me please, is that liberally is settled, that the owner who comes in and signs his principals of bond just to release the boat is not a party to that libel suit, is not thereby made a party?</text>

            <text syncTime="645.506" offset="2685367">His only liability then is on the bond but not in the original proceeding which continues against the vessel or the bond in rem.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.636" offset="2721938">He is not an actual party.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.883" offset="2726954">Now, it's a tremendously interesting question and perhaps I should go into it a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.397" offset="2768959">There, the case is unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.639" offset="2777945">Two cases of this Court upheld, one involving a fire statute which limits the liability of the owner in case of fire on a vessel under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.747" offset="2810337">A contention was made, the vessel does not have that immunity which is granted by statute to the owner of the vessel and this Court has held that doesn't make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.452" offset="2857148">The vessel does have the same immunity as the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.318" offset="2872613">The same thing applies to the limitation of liability which is a sort of bankruptcy statute under which the owner of a vessel may limit his liability to the value of the vessel after the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.847" offset="2926738">In those cases, he files his petition for limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.607" offset="2941785">He puts up a bond for that value and the vessel is released and he then repairs the vessel and an action was brought against the vessel as repaired stating the limitation does not apply to the vessel, only to the owner and this Court said that is talking in riddles and doesn't make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.970" offset="3011271">In the third case, Boyd I think, and it is another case in this Court and that did not involve admiralty but it involved an action in rem, Boyd versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.585" offset="3077726">That was a forfeiture condemnation proceeding in rem against merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.973" offset="3115238">The United States on seizing that property sought to require the owner of the property to bring his books and records in the Court from which they would get certain information.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.396" offset="3164975">He pleaded the Fifth Amendment and the Government said, “Well, this is not an action against you, it's an action in rem.”</text>
            <text syncTime="773.331" offset="3196740">And they held that nevertheless, he was entitled to that defense and that would be carrying the doctrine too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.328" offset="3224639">Now, those are the three cases in this Court that tie in, let us say, the owner with the race in such an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.936" offset="3255150">But it -- there isn't any question that the action in rem is different from an action in personam despite the fact that such distinctions or analogies as the case maybe have been made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1304.440" offset="5321122">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.948" offset="5339199">I think the fundamental purpose of this appeal is to determine and to effectuate in some manner the purpose of the transfer statute whether it'd be in a patent case, a diversity case or an admiralty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.518" offset="5405445">Now, certainly, the purpose of the statute is not questionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.934" offset="5423104">It was, I'm sure, to save time and expense and to promote the efficient administration of our judicial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.782" offset="5466467">How to achieve this purpose is obviously questionable in view of these appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.609" offset="5497814">I would like to address myself first to the question of ambiguity of the transfer statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.802" offset="5530624">It has been suggested in the Paramount-Rodney case and I think clearly implied in the Karachi case that Mr. Deutsch just mentioned in the Fourth Circuit that the word “brought” means simply filed in a court that has jurisdiction of the subject matter, nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.308" offset="5620590">That is that you need not be able to maintain the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.520" offset="5641488">Thus, in the Karachi case, a suit was filed in New York for the obvious purpose of interrupting the one year limitation under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.835" offset="5686732">The allegation account that Mr. Deutsch mentioned was made that the vessel would be within the jurisdiction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.749" offset="5718392">The vessel in fact never was on learning that you would call at Baltimore, the motion to transfer was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.505" offset="5753396">Judge Parker in the course of his opinion pointed out first that the filing of the suit in New York interrupted proscription.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.451" offset="5797177">That is, the Court had come -- the court was a court of competent jurisdiction and therefore, the filing of the suit even without (Inaudible) of process within the year was sufficient to interrupt proscription.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.158" offset="5856005">He further said that clearly, the Court had jurisdiction over the subject matter and therefore powered to any -- any necessary orders to maintain the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.230" offset="5908250">This must -- this evidence is, one, interpretation of the word “brought” in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.978" offset="5939284">Other cases including Judge Whittaker's opinion in the General Electric case, apparently take the position that the word “brought” means filed at a time when the Court has power to issue process and in other words, power to achieve or file adjudication of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.761" offset="6026428">So there, we have two clearly divergent ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.125" offset="6063835">Secondly, we have the time problem which has been mentioned here before and to further confound that time problem or I think everyone agrees that the words “might have been brought” not everyone certainly, but Mr. King was the last one that suggested it, refer to some time in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.790" offset="6146487">Now, in this particular case, the accident happened in Memphis, Tennessee while our barge is being loaded by the -- with the petitioner's grain, the barge sank in Memphis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.997" offset="6199359">The grain was removed by sailboats, the barge was raised and she remained in Memphis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.952" offset="6227153">According to the record, for a week or more after the sinking, now, might not this action have been brought in Memphis and I do not intend to make a play on words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.335" offset="6272711">But the barge was there, subject to the process of the Memphis Court at a time prior to the filing of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.468" offset="7873285">The Admiralty Rule then being that there was no maritime lien for repairs and supplies performed as given in the homeport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.445" offset="7909125">The Court held that that rule was valid, that it was not an extension of jurisdiction although it did authorize an in rem process and of seizure where non-existed under the maritime law, but that it was merely a rule regulating practice before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.617" offset="7997837">Now, certainly, a transfer of this action is nothing more than a regulation of the practice or administration of the District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.884" offset="8042872">The -- if -- if again our opponents are correct and there can never be a transfer in an in rem action in admiralty, the -- and certainly, those cases must arise for the convenience of the parties and witnesses in the interest of justice would be served, the only way to achieve it then would be pursuant -- excuse me -- to Rule 44.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.131" offset="8151855">And we suggest to the Court that that is a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.843" offset="8186755">Now, with regard to the question of the personification of a vessel, I have rather a number of cases as I'm sure that people have and I am frankly confessed that I'm somewhat misdefined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.308" offset="8264600">They say that a -- on offending vessel is a juridical person entitled to be proceeded against in rem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.577" offset="8305664">But what happens where the owner is not in (Inaudible) the vessel doesn't defend the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.114" offset="8331786">The vessel doesn't pay and again in the case of (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.839" offset="8358745">The vessel doesn't pay the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.594" offset="8369716">The vessel doesn't post a bond and certainly, the claimant of any vessel is a very much interested party to any litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.426" offset="8413080">He does not simply come in and say, “I claim the vessel and I put up a bond and I will await your decree.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.760" offset="8450382">He comes in and files a claim as we did here saying that he claims the said barge's owner and prays to be permitted to defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.543" offset="8497507">That is the claimant's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.661" offset="8505971">He is the owner of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.259" offset="8512449">He has a proprietary interest in it and as this Court said in the Boyd case mentioned by Mr. Deutsch, the vessel doesn't pay the claimant, the owner does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.836" offset="8558738">Now, another interesting case along those lines is the decision of Judge Learned Hand in Burns Brothers Transportation Company versus the Central Railroad of New Jersey which will indicate the fact that at least in the Second Circuit, the personification theory has gotten somewhat out of vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.954" offset="8643166">In that case, Burns Brothers sued for barge damage caused by a collision with a car float belonging to the Central Railroad of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.688" offset="8682141">The car float, when it had gone adrift was in the possession of the -- or Long Island Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.232" offset="8712338">The suits were filed in personam only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.529" offset="8725504">The time of trial, the central was in reorganization and the trial of course did not proceed against that road.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.527" offset="8753507">A decree of sole fault was entered against the Long Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.261" offset="8768449">When they went around to collect a decree, the Long Island was in reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.250" offset="8796348">The libelant then had the idea that he would file an in rem suit against the car float which he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.610" offset="8829785">Now, what I say to this Court now was dicta, for a reason I will mention but Judge Learned Hand there held that the pry in personam decrees were bars to the -- in present in rem action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.405" offset="8889031">And he said, “Disputes arise between human beings not inanimate things and would be absurd to give the beaten party another chance because on second trial, he appears as a claimant to a vessel that is and can be nothing but the measure of his stake in the controversy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.459" offset="8981191">He then went on however to permit the suit because at the time the first action was filed, seizure, in rem seizure of the car float was prohibited pursuant to an order in the reorganization proceedings.</text>
