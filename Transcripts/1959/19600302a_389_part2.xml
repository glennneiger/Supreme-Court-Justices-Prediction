            <label>Mr. Edgar Barton</label>
            <text syncTime="1.873" offset="110843">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.163" offset="120038">During the course of the price reductions that AB made in St. Louis, it overhauled its sales methods and intensified them.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.366" offset="156818">The amount spent for advertising both in St. Louis and outside St. Louis was increased to the level of its competitors in St. Louis and increased outside and all these things were done for the purpose of obtaining more business.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.853" offset="214810">With reference to the question Your Honor asked as to why Budweiser price was raised in March of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.574" offset="241664">The reason which appears in the record is that in that -- at that time Anheuser-Busch put out a new product, which was called Busch Lager and was retailed as (Inaudible) of the regional beers in St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.239" offset="300283">It was also put out over a wider area.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.759" offset="310418">That one didn't go over and a new product Busch (Inaudible) was put out and that's was presently on the market, but in connection with putting out the new product it was inconsistent to have Budweiser in the new product selling at the same price, so Budweiser was raised, the amount which was specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.408" offset="376978">Thereafter, several months after the price raise in March of 1955 the Federal Trade Commission charged that our price reduction in St Louis violated the Clayton Act as amended by Robinson-Patman.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.504" offset="429432">Now, in essence the facts found by the Commission here, and I think the facts are important is that AB is not a -- one of the delights of industry such as might be true in the Standard Oil case back in the days when before this Clayton was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.071" offset="511666">Anheuser-Busch has 70% of national sales of beers.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.169" offset="532041">As a matter of fact all of the competitors in St Louis were among the largest 35 brewers in United States and Falstaff was number 4 among the brewers in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.552" offset="589615">Now its true Budweiser sold at many markets in the country at various prices depending upon that differing freight rates from St Louis to those markets, depending upon the different tax rate that exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.293" offset="636531">There's a great variety of taxes for beer which is up in Washington DC and in Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.232" offset="656280">Missouri has the lowest tax on beer than any State in the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.452" offset="677177">And --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="143.530" stopTime="147.364">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="143.530" offset="677491">Is all the beer actually brewed in St Louis, or do you have breweries around country?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edgar_e_barton" startTime="147.364" stopTime="349.269">
            <label>Mr. Edgar Barton</label>
            <text syncTime="147.364" offset="692851">We have two other breweries Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.132" offset="699852">There's a brewery in North New Jersey and there's a brewer -- brewery in Los Angeles, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.702" offset="726183">Falstaff on the other hand have seven breweries located conveniently around the 1/3 of the country in which they do business.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.746" offset="754395">And therefore they have lower freight rates from their breweries to markets than we have from St Louis to those markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.209" offset="780204">Now the Commission expressly recognized therefore, that it would be contrary to market reality to require a uniform pricing by AB or by any other brewery.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.850" offset="822732">At the time of our temporary price reductions in St Louis our competitors there accounted for 83% of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.770" offset="858467">We had 12% and 5% was represented by other national shipping breweries and some others.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.764" offset="890441">All the competitors in St Louis they stated were substantial companies doing business as counsel said over a wide area and they have between 75% and 90% of their sales outside St Louis where there was no price reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.722" offset="950209">Petitioner concedes that there was no proof of any sales below cost during either price reductions and indeed there was a concession of the trial that we operated profitably in St Louis during the period.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.049" offset="995558">The only claimed result of the price reduction was that AB, the last place seller in St Louis temporarily gained some sales in the St Louis market while its competitors accounted for somewhat less of the market during that period than they previously had, 2/3 of the market rather than 4/5 of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.943" offset="1083120">Now on these bare facts, the Commission found that we violated the Robinson-Patman Act stating that we've discriminated in price because we reduced the prices in St Louis and didn't reduce them elsewhere and that we injured competition because the difference in our prices in St Louis and markets elsewhere caused the diversion of sale to us from our competitors in St Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.836" offset="1186670">That's what they held and the meeting competition event was inapplicable they said for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.363" offset="1212792">First, they said its -- they claim that our reduced prices which at their lowest exactly equal to our competitor's prices did not meet an equally low price but rather under kept them and they held further in denying the meeting competition defense that since we were not losing sales in St Louis but losing them elsewhere, we couldn't reduce our prices in St Louis in order to recoup some of those loses, even though the competitors inside St Louis and outside St Louis to whom we are losing the business were by and large the same and it was feasible for us to reduce the prices in St Louis to recapture part of that business and it wasn't feasible for us to do it outside St Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.642" offset="1393977">The way they expressed however, more advantageous it was for us to do it in St Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.223" offset="1416234">The Commission on the basis of these findings and these facts which they found issued an order which would prohibit AB from ever making any reduction in price any place that it had a competitor which is every place, unless it proportionally reduced its prices everywhere simultaneously.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="349.269" offset="1500453">Where is that order found?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edgar Barton</label>
            <text syncTime="351.010" offset="1507453">The order is at R 488 Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="356.489" stopTime="361.152">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="edgar_e_barton" startTime="361.152" stopTime="739.878">
            <label>Mr. Edgar Barton</label>
            <text syncTime="361.152" offset="1547995">Now it's true that the counsel for the Government now concedes that that order maybe unduly broad, but I submit to Your Honors that that order is a precise -- precise reflection of whole commission theory in this case and that the concession which is made with the respect breadth of the order is really a concession with regards to the theory of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.917" offset="1647052">Now I might say that in the Court of Appeals we made four contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.565" offset="1669622">We urge that there was no discrimination in the price demonstrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.963" offset="1687176">This issue arose not on the petition for review but when the Commission filed its brief in the Court of Appeals and expressly stated that it was not concerned with differences in price among the markets but solely with the reduction in price in one market without simultaneous reductions elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.116" offset="1755826">Second we argued that even there was a discrimination in price there was no injury to competition shown from the discrimination as required by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.341" offset="1792711">Third that in any event AB had met an equally low price of competitor in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.958" offset="1815176">And fourth, that order was illegal in the sense that its effect was to eliminate and deprive AB of statutory defenses and would be completely anti-competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.912" offset="1859062">The Court of Appeals held that AB did not discriminate the price between different purchasers as required by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.428" offset="1889050">It refused to adopt the Commission's position that a price discrimination as demonstrated here by a mere price reduction in one market without simultaneous reductions everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.625" offset="1937847">Rather it held that whereas here different prices in different markets were characteristic of all sellers in the industry, a mere price reduction in one market did not mean that there was a discrimination in price within the meaning of Section 2 (a) of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.691" offset="1998137">Based upon the legislative history, it held that price discrimination means more than mere difference in price and notice that the Commission did not complain about the common fact this is having different prices in different markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.266" offset="2048397">Viewing the cases it did, it did not reach the Commission's contention that in the alleged diversion, temporary diversion of sale has amounted to injury within 2 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="497.017" offset="2091447">And although it didn't reach the Commission's restrictive interpretation of Section 2 (b) of the Act, the Court of Appeals expressly stated that they did not reach these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.403" offset="2133034">Having stated what this case involves perhaps it is -- perhaps it is well also to state what it does not involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.866" offset="2158843">First, despite the argument made counsel in the -- for the Government in the petition for certiorari and its main brief, the case does not involve the proposition that a price discrimination under 2 (a) is limited to sales at different prices to competing purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.064" offset="2231672">We have never so contended.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.843" offset="2238777">We do not now so contend and the Court below did not so hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.537" offset="2257481">The Commission's argument in the petition for certiorari in its main brief was directed not upon what the Court held, but rather upon what the Commission called the thrust of the opinion and upon the Court's emphasis on certain facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.853" offset="2314742">In our brief, filed here, we demonstrated the Court of Appeals obviously recognized that 2 (a) covered sales at different prices to non-competing customers by its full quotation from Congress and had it back, which outlined the possibility of discrimination in price between non-competing purchasers under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.406" offset="2396975">We noted that when the Commission's brief referred to the legislative history relied upon by the Court of Appeals it omitted that portion which referred to sales below cost which could be referable only to price discrimination among non-competing purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.240" offset="2460296">Now in its reply brief and its oral argument, I do not believe that petitioner repeats the precise position which it took in the petition for certiorari in its main brief but appears to have abandoned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.026" offset="2511496">It now contends that the Court below construed the statute so as to make it applicable to different prices to non competing purchasers only when adverse economic effects upon purchasers paying higher prices are shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.357" offset="2568756">However, this is not correct either.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.731" offset="2578265">To be sure, the legislative history shows that the relationship between non competing purchasers is required, but this does not mean and the Court of Appeals did not hold or even infer that injury to purchasers paying the higher price was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.657" offset="2645974">Rather, the legislative history shows and the Court of Appeals held by inference if not expressly, that what is required to create the relationship between non competing purchasers was proof of sales below cost or necessary profit in the area of the lower prices thereby leaving that deficit if such losses has occurred to be made up by higher prices to other purchasers elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.136" offset="2751927">However, this case does not involve sales and loss in one market until the competitors were forced out of business while at the same -- same time making up those losses in other markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.964" offset="2795186">They expressly conceded during the proceeding that the increased sales of AB and St. Louis allowed it to operate properly within that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.673" offset="2826115">They expressly found there was no proof of -- that we used income or profit from the rest of our businesses to stabilize losses in Saint Louis or indeed that were any losses in St. Louis and counsel here concedes that those findings were made. Consequently there were no losses to be passed on by higher prices to purchasers in other areas, Moreover, the St. Louis competitors were not just local competitors, but they were substantial company, doing business through out a wide area and they were willing to transport from St. Louis and the outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.512" offset="2957458">It was expressly found as I said that 75% to 90% of their business was done outside of St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.615" offset="2985880">It was apparent to these competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.052" offset="2991626">They couldn't be put of a business or their competition impaired by AB's price reduction in St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.364" offset="3016808">Now, with respect to the first issue here, the issue of whether not AB discriminated in price that -- that was the decisive issue in the Court of Appeals, I turn first to the words of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="803.384" offset="3316903">Now the statute itself, 2 (a), provides in pertinent parts that it shall be unlawful to discriminate in price between different purchasers where the affect of such discrimination maybe substantially lessen competition or great monopoly in any line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.215" offset="3384195">Thus, there are at least three separate elements which must be proved before a violation of the statute is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.478" offset="3409272">First, that a seller discriminates in price between different purchasers Second, that there may be in any line of Commerce, the injury to competition required by the statute and third, that that injury to competition was caused by the discrimination in prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.792" offset="3474578">The Commission here asked the Court of Appeals to hold that a mere reduction of prices in St. Louis without reducing prices in other marketing areas was itself to discriminate in price.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.228" offset="3528286">The Court of Appeals held as I've stated that AB and not -- was not shown to have discriminated in price between different purchasers as required by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.827" offset="3562663">It held that to discriminate in price between different purchasers meant more than to merely reduce prices in one area or to charge different prices in different areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.256" offset="3604355">If I understand them correctly here, the Commission now argues to this Court that AB discriminated in price because it contends any difference in price between markets is a discrimination in price.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.160" offset="3664018">You'll recall when counsel read the statute, he substituted the word “different” for “discrimination” and construed discrimination to mean difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.856" offset="3706755">Now, since it's customary in many industries for companies to have different prices in different markets, the ramifications of the adoption of this doctrine are extremely pervasive and will inevitably deter normal pricing activities which have no anti trust significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.206" offset="3788152">This Court has never draft -- directly passed upon the meaning of discriminate in price in a territorial price case.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.906" offset="3822947">Balian against Arden Farms, a decision in the Ninth Circuit, directly involved the question and came to the same conclusion as the Seventh Circuit in this case, namely, that a mere difference in price didn't constitute a discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.288" offset="3872475">This Court denied certiorari in Balian.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.760" offset="3890448">Now, in this case the Court of appeals applied the plain dictionary meaning of discriminate that is, differentiating unfairly in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.942" offset="3935169">The Commission's main brief to this Court concedes as much but claims that another dictionary meaning which it mis-cites should been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.473" offset="3977279">But all the legislative history is in accord with the meaning of discriminate applied by the Court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.078" offset="4003715">That legislative history demonstrates that the term discriminate in price means more that a mere difference in price.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.358" offset="4032763">Congressman Utterback's statement, Congressman Utterback was the Floor Manager of Robins-Patman, he has been much with his statement -- had been much relied upon by this Court, in other cases, Congressman Utterback stated quite plainly and I quote “It has meaning as simple English A discrimination is more than a mere difference.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.632" offset="4113951">We have found nothing in the legislative history to the contrary and nothing contrary is cited in either the Commission's briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.004" offset="4143417">In fact, petitioner now appears to agree that a discrimination is more than a mere difference when it states in its reply brief at page 7 that discrimination in legal usage means more than a differentiation in treatment which judged by controlling legal standard is invidious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.689" offset="4226173">Now if the differentiation must be invidious then I submit that discrimination must be more than a mere difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.177" offset="6924100">Now why should it -- just take a couple of examples that deter -- that outline and elucidate why a difference is not a discrimination?</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.992" offset="6963388">Suppose a manufacturer is loosing sales generally throughout the country, there are a number of things that he can try to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.561" offset="6985644">He can try to increase his advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.777" offset="6994526">He can try change his package or his product, but if it is a product on the classical theory he'll decide, well let's try lowering prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.315" offset="7020648">Lower prices means more sale, but there is such a thing inelastic demand and he may wish to try out that lowering of prices to try it in one or two markets to see how it goes and then if it works there, lower generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.329" offset="7072684">Now there a lowering of prices in one market and not others, sales may increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.341" offset="7096717">But if you try -- tried it and be successful under the Commission's theory it'd be violating the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.169" offset="7140080">Or suppose in a very competitive market where there are number of strong competitors one competitor changes its price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.948" offset="7163173">Product is binding a small patented gadget or he gets an advertising campaign that catches on and that competitor begins to take over increase in share of the businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.649" offset="7206013">Our manufacturer can't make the thing, product's change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.086" offset="7215731">His advertising agency can't produce the same catchy slogan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.141" offset="7231927">So you have to reduce prices slightly in order to try to make up for that advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.572" offset="7249690">Or suppose that the manufacturer is not selling it all on a particular market and he wants to enter the market in order to get a toe hold as Hamms Beer is trying to do in this market as you may have noticed in the Washington Post advertisement yesterday, coming into the market at local beer prices even though they sell them in Chicago and all the rest of the country, this part of the country at so-called premium prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.931" offset="7347075">Now, there are many other examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.926" offset="7359091">It's perfectly true that none of those situations are precisely the case we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.915" offset="7379048">But the point is, that localized price reductions or difference in price between different markets serve a perfectly legitimate purpose and it is with the view towards permitting the continuation of these and other legitimate purposes that the statute should be construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.669" offset="7446026">And I might point out that none of these illustrations come within the statutory defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.989" offset="7467342">If they are to be preserved, therefore it must be by construction of some other term in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.933" offset="7487091">Thus Congress and Utterback have told it and these illustrations have shown that a discrimination in price is more than a mere difference in price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.356" offset="7516766">But what in addition is required?</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.206" offset="7528155">Well, I pointed out in answer Justice Black's question at least that the Congressman Utterback's statement shows clearly that the other circumstance which is required is proof that the seller who had the different prices is selling below cost and necessary profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.730" offset="7586252">And I don't understand in the light of the terms of that statement how the Commission can claim, as it does in its reply in its brief, Reply (B) that the decision below would leave business organizations free to cause to conduct territorial price foray so long as they were willing to absorb loses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.368" offset="7652812">If they had loses, there would be discrimination in price under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.014" offset="7671411">Now, this analysis is consistent with the legislative history as contained in the House committee Report of the original Section 2 of the Clayton Act which is relied upon by petitioner in its brief in part as the report on the bill which became the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.088" offset="7727731">This committee report demonstrates that the evil at which Section 2 was directed in connection with territorial price differences was lower prices involving sales of a commodity at below the cost of production with the intent of destroying the business of competitors of the seller and obtain a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.274" offset="7800456">Now, it's not a sufficient answer to claim that this legislative history is wholly inapplicable because the bill was changed in conference before enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.174" offset="7832116">The evil remains the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.057" offset="7839640">It is true that the language of the bill was changed and that the language requiring proof of purpose was eliminated when the bill was rewritten by the conference committee as is claimed by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.028" offset="7887496">However, it is clear that the House report described the evil at which the territorial price aspects to the bill were drafted and that is still the evil, I submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.845" offset="7926784">Moreover, the prior adjudicated price cases in which the violation has been found, uniformly involve situations of this nature, sales below cost to drive out the sole competitor and obtain a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.217" offset="7980283">As counsel said in answer to Mr. Justice Whittaker's question this morning, he is not talking about in this case, a case like the Standard Oil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.449" offset="8017168">He's talking about the case that the Commission made in -- in this situation and it's a case that's far different from those cases that have been brought under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.502" offset="8069413">It was true in the only territorial price case has been before the District Court, Moore against Mead there, there was terribly low cost as disclosed in the record and the clear purpose was as found in the -- as stated in the opinion to drive a competitor out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.027" offset="8131480">It was true in Porto Rican and it was true in Muller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.602" offset="8145795">In Maryland Baking, there was a clear purpose to punish a competitor for who went into a business that the discriminator didn't want him to go into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.474" offset="8177246">There wasn't clear proof of sales below cost but the issue was not made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.831" offset="8202742">In none of these cases was the meaning of the statutory term “discriminated in price” at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.172" offset="8220087">However they are -- each one of them consistent with our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.045" offset="8235551">In the one case that we found in which this was an issue, Balian, the absence of such facts led the Ninth Circuit to hold that the price reduction made (Inaudible) in Los Angeles but not elsewhere was not in price discrimination within the meaning of the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2354.466" offset="9521194">Now, this analysis I submit indicates that the words “discriminating in price” are not to be construed out of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.755" offset="9558392">Petitioner's position is that any difference in prices of discrimination but is not actionable under 2 (a) unless it causes injury to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.219" offset="9592247">But if the rule were that a mere difference in price constitutes a discrimination within the meaning of the statute then any manufacturer selling at different prices in more than one marketing area would be at the mercy of consumer reaction as to -- as to whether he'd be -- be found in violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.219" offset="9656299">If consumers decided to buy more of his products in the areas where he had a lower price for any number of legitimate reasons then he's violating 2 (a) under the Commission's decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.349" offset="9700812">The inevitable tendency of the adoption of such rule would for all sellers to have uniformly high prices throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.083" offset="9739682">It is difficult if not impossible to envisage the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.893" offset="9754937">How the public interest would be served by such a construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.467" offset="9773223">For under these circumstances 2 (a) would become a price fixing law inconsistent with the overall Congressional policy of protecting free competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.228" offset="9816273">Every reduction in price in a particular market and every difference in price would become vulnerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.366" offset="9836857">No seller could risk reducing his price in any market without reducing -- even though to gain business he lost elsewhere because if you obtain more business in the area of the price reduction, you can never be sure that the Commission or some treble damage plaintiff would sue in a Court and claim he has violated the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.440" offset="9917106">Since the seller could never know in advance whether his price, sales had increased as a result of the price reduction, who would never reduce prices unless he thought so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.715" offset="9958275">In any realistic view of the Commission's proposition, 2 (a) becomes a compelling deterrent to active price competition and price competition is the very essence of competition itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.073" offset="10007698">Petitioner's position would create the incongruous result that price competition would be more restricted than none-price forms of competition such as advertising, sales promotion, and other forms of sales activity which do not benefit the public would recommend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.913" offset="10083035">If sales gained were due to price competition, lowering prices in one area but not lowering them elsewhere, they'd been forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.599" offset="10121801">If due to a better finance advertising program by a seller in that area, they would enjoy a preferred legal position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.312" offset="10156596">I submit the statute should not be construed to create this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.140" offset="10179897">After all, prices are, as this Court stated in Socony Vacuum like this, the central nervous system of the economy and any restrictions which would interfere with the free movement of price is to be avoided unless absolutely required by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2664.220" offset="10760234">Secondly, we had well presented the St. Louis area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.793" offset="10774549">That was our home market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.321" offset="10780609">Our competitors had 30%, (Inaudible) had something like 25% and one or the others had 35%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.996" offset="10811329">We had a potential for growth in St. Louis for increased sales by decreasing prices there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.716" offset="10838288">In St. Louis, we distributed directly to retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.081" offset="10851662">We didn't have to depend on chain that the price reduction would be passed on to retailers by the wholesalers where we distribute in most other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.210" offset="10888234">Those are the reasons that we reduced prices in St. Louis and we told them, time and time again in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.146" offset="10915924">Now, we contend, Your Honor here that even if this Court should not adopt the reasoning adopted below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.808" offset="10954585">The Court could and should examine the other two contentions and rule on them here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.670" offset="10982066">Now, it's clear that the Court has the power to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.699" offset="10994186">It's clear also, it seems to me, that the Court should do so here for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.300" offset="11012577">In the first place, this case in its various facets has attracted wide attention in the commercial world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.335" offset="11036714">And until this issue of whether difference in prices is discrimination and whether therefore manufacturers can be sued for having different prices, it's a clog on commercial competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.184" offset="11084152">And it should be decided and decided here now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.606" offset="11097840">Secondly, the Commission is carrying -- has instituted a number of cases in industries diverse as oil and milk based the same theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.297" offset="11136606">If the theory is wrong, they should be told so to save time and for that reason, we think that the other two issues should be examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.383" offset="11168893">Now, in connection with the issue of injury to competition, the Commission's sole basis for claimed injury here is that some of these competitors temporarily lost business in St. Louis and we temporarily gained something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.260" offset="11248410">Now, that has never been considered by any court to be a sufficient basis to find injury to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.406" offset="11284982">In all of the other cases where there has been a finding of injury to competition based on a territorial price case, there has been one competitor in an area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.590" offset="11329703">The sales have been below that competitor's price or below cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.057" offset="11355617">The period of the price reduction has been an extended one so that the competitor was driven out of business and also, there's been a destruction of a channel of distribution of the competing seller as in Maryland Baking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.993" offset="11427297">Now, here we have no one of these things, or anything that's comparable to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.335" offset="11452688">The fact here is that there are multiple substantial competitors in the area of the price reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.673" offset="11482049">The price reductions were made only in the one city, in the County of St. Louis and the competitors were firmly entrenched elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.412" offset="11509008">Reductions were completely temporary in nature. Competitors listed the effects of those reductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.560" offset="11533563">The reductions were at no time below their price of the competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.265" offset="11552475">All the competitors continued to sell to the same retailers to whom they'd sold previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.611" offset="11573791">All the competitors pursued normal competitive activities putting out new brands, advertising programs and last but not least, the competitors continued to make substantial profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.183" offset="11620080">On that basis, Your Honor, we contend that there was no injury to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.144" offset="11639933">It's a legal question really in this case whether there was injury to competition because the facts they're not really disputed, the only question is whether temporary diversion of sales from substantial companies amounts to injury to competition within the meaning of Robinson-Patman and I submit that it does not.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="2984.128" offset="12039920">The Court, please, though the argument has covered a broad ground, I believe that the issue actually presented to this Court for a decision is rather narrow is a very important one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.456" offset="12089240">And that issue is the correctness of the construction of the statute which was made by the Court of Appeals at the very threshold of the appeal and on the basis of its disposition of that question the Court of Appeals did not reach the issues which were actually presented for review in the petition for review of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.033" offset="12235525">There were issues as to whether the findings as to injury to competition were adequately sustained by the evidence, whether there was a -- the respondent had established the meeting competition in good faith defense but the Commission's order was too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.026" offset="12291427">The Court of Appeals, in its opinion which appears in Volume 3 of the record starting at page 1550, assumes without upholding but it assumes the findings of the Commission that there was such an injury to competition as required by Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.360" offset="12384841">It assumes the correctness of those findings without examining them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.675" offset="12402082">The Court of Appeals as I mentioned earlier, accepted as a premise of its decision that this was a quote, “predatory pricing practice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.797" offset="12446595">It assumed that it was directed at respondent's competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.542" offset="12469582">It said, “Notwithstanding, those findings of injury to competition in the St. Louis market, that there was no discrimination because there was no discrimination between purchasers there could be no violation of Section 2,” the Court of Appeals said that there has to be a relationship between the purchasers who had charged the different prices in order for there to be a discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.313" offset="12596642">It says that where two purchases from a seller are competing with each other, that competition creates a relationship that entitles them to comparable treatment as to the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.287" offset="12640528">It also quoted the statement of Representative Utterback as to the prices being so low as to involve a sacrifice of -- of profits and costs that made up in a higher price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.608" offset="12693817">From that statement, the respondent finds that the Court of Appeals does not limit its holding of a relationship to situation where are there are competing customers, but it also -- it may exist according to respondent's reading between non competing customers if there is a sale at so low a price that it affects the purchaser in another area, a non competing purchaser who pays the higher price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.773" offset="12822444">That's a very narrow construction of the statute, but it is an extremely important one because if that is accepted in our view, it (Inaudible) Section 2 of the Clayton Act of 1914 as it was incorporated and broadened by the Robinson-Patman Act in 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.458" offset="12905200">It would require a showing not only that there'd be an injury even if the injury would be a complete destruction of the seller's competition in the market of the price cut that would not be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.559" offset="12965595">You would also have to show a relationship to the purchasers and other markets paying the higher price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.553" offset="12993599">That relationship, Mr. Barton conceded in response to the questions from the bench would be established if there was a purpose to destroy competitors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3242.807" offset="13074578">I don't -- and I don't see how the existence of a purpose in one market to destroy the competitors of the sellers in that -- of the seller in that market has anything to do with the purchasers in the other markets who pay the higher price and I think it was for that reason that he was somewhat reluctant to concede that that was a violation of the statute because if you need a relationship between purchasers, clearly the -- the existence of the predatory purpose assuming the facts are required which is of course another question that, that has nothing to do with the relationship to the purchasers in the other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.671" offset="13222013">Similarly, he said it does not have to be a reduction below cost and he conceded in response to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question that if it was below the normal profit, that that's a violation -- that could also be a violation but that also could indicate a relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.051" offset="13291604">We -- we don't see how even a reduction below cost in one area has anything to do with the price in another area unless it'd be assumed as a matter of law that whenever a seller reduces his prices in one area, it necessarily comes out as either it's capital or it's profits or whatever he -- he makes from his business all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.230" offset="13404244">We -- if -- if the statute is to be interpreted as meaning to Federal Trade Commission or a plaintiff in a private treble damage action who was injured by -- by this kind of a practice has to make present cost accounting date to show that that lawsuit had actually been incurred by the seller when he reduces his price for a discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.852" offset="13486791">And that he has actually passed them on to the purchasers in the other market we think that is the -- that -- that the Clayton Act has been substantially appealed.</text>
