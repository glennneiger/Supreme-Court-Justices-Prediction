            <text syncTime="588.013" offset="2455385">So that they -- the Federal Power Commission had decided that it would have a substantial effect on navigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="613.698" offset="2558203">And under that license, they agreed to comply with the requirements of the Government in regard to releases from the dam and the Secretary of War in 1941 established a regimen of how the releases had to be made and the Pensacola Dam had a provision in it for aid to navigation, flood control and hydroelectric development.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.776" offset="2682441">The Ft. Gibson dam that's an issue here also had exactly the three -- same three elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.816" offset="2714624">The Court of Claims decided as one of its findings, Finding 17, that this dam had those three elements and did affect navigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="979.738" offset="4022314">They had never applied water at this place and that's the only thing that's involved here because they tried to get the Commission, the Federal Power Commission to assess damages against the United States for the values that might be in their reservoir at the Pensacola.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.199" offset="4096188">And the Federal Power Commission, the Court of Appeals held that they weren't entitled to such damages that the United States wouldn't -- couldn't have been required to pay such damages, in regard to their pool above the Pensacola Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.873" offset="4154911">So then, there's the question of what kind of water rights they get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.551" offset="4173615">Now, remember where the United States here is using a run of the stream in this use of this water on this dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.882" offset="4214888">The water is held back not over 24 hours in the entire time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.359" offset="4236831">The water is not consumed under water law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1040.104" offset="4263790">It's just passing it through the penstocks and the -- the turbines and goes right on down the stream without any diminution whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.279" offset="4316453">Now the only water -- we're not asking to make a change of one drop in their releases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.632" offset="4349889">The only water we're going to use and are using -- because this is an operation now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.669" offset="4377997">At the Ft. Gibson Dam is the water that they are required under the federal law, under their federal license and under the regulations of the Secretary of War to deliver down that stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.275" offset="4436511">We're not asking to release one additional drop of water beyond what they have, to now, locally release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.628" offset="4469844">And they claim that they've got some kind of water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.949" offset="4487189">I think their claim is appropriate to water rights in that -- that water that goes down below their dam and we have to pay for because we have erected a federal dam at the Ft. Gibson site.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.803" offset="4542568">Now, that's the basic issue about the compensation for water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.416" offset="4565034">Now, it's the position of the United States that they could not have such water rights under the Oklahoma law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.492" offset="4605367">Oklahoma law is complicated about water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.016" offset="4619473">It has apparently -- the best we can determine from their decisions and from the writers, a combination somewhat like California in regard to riparian and appropriative water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.042" offset="4683525">Both are present within the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.786" offset="4702542">There aren't any riparian lands so there just can't be riparian rights here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.584" offset="4725739">There was no claim that they've ever been, had and separated and sold off like international power, nothing of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.115" offset="4755832">So, the only thing left that they've got is that they've got to be appropriative rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.426" offset="4785089">Now, the test of appropriative rights generally in all western water is that it's got to be diverted and applied to beneficial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.956" offset="4827199">And until that time it's in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.648" offset="4837961">It isn't a vested water right at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.057" offset="4851649">Now, that is described in so many words by the laws of Oklahoma.</text>

            <text syncTime="2775.131" offset="11203897">The Solicitor General has very graciously conceded that if the Grand River Dam Authority a duly constituted agency of the State of Oklahoma can show that the waters of the Grand River were appropriated to it and put to beneficial use that then the Grand River Dam Authority would be entitled to compensation for the taking which has been accomplished by the Government in the building of the Ft. Gibson dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.385" offset="11336913">The -- the Corps of Engineers in 1932 made an exhaustive study of the water shed of the Grand River and its extension on up into the State of Kansas where it is called Neosho River.</text>

            <text syncTime="2848.710" offset="11498245">Those recommendations, were generally, that navigation is not materially affected by the activities of the waters in the Grand River, that the production of power on the Grand River was deemed to be economic and that if it were economic it should be left to the -- to private capital to exploit and --and use and it recommended that there was no interest that there be no interest to the Federal Government insofar as flood control is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.325" offset="11648711">This report was made after extensive hearings, public hearings that were held throughout the State of Oklahoma.</text>

            <text syncTime="2913.875" offset="11758843">And it thereby created by legislative act, the Grand River Dam Authority and the court below and its findings have set forth generally and specifically as to what this authority constituted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3072.941" offset="12395186">Now, in 1935, this Act was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.639" offset="12417964">It was copied just after a -- a similar Act which had been adopted for the State of Texas for the control of the lower Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.489" offset="12453282">It was copied as a matter of fact almost verbatim and has been patterned after that in a good many ways ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.111" offset="12491839">The Grand River Dam Authority thus being constituted with the authority to borrow money in order to -- to develop this natural resource as set about in the employment of engineers and they developed and the court below has so found a comprehensive plan for the beneficial use of the Grand River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.318" offset="12588596">And this plan which is set forth in the findings on page 6A in the form of a map depicts the building of the head water dam, the Pensacola Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.704" offset="12646170">This is the larger of the three units that were contemplated and the key unit to the development of water power and of flood control incidentally, on the Grand River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.521" offset="12693504">The second dam was down the stream some 50 miles known as the Markham Ferry Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.101" offset="12715760">And the Markham Ferry Dam, The Federal Power Commission has issued a license to the State of Oklahoma and the -- they are to the Grand River Dam Authority an agency of the State of Oklahoma and they are in the process of going forward with the construction of that dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.559" offset="12785560">The third unit in this plan which was adopted by the authority was a dam at Ft. Gibson, eight miles up from the confluence of the Grand and the Arkansas River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.754" offset="12842402">At the site, at the -- practically the exact site where the Government has come in and appropriated the water rights and the franchise of the State by building a dam there on, which it had the right and the power to do but not without compensating the Grand River Dam Authority for the loss of its property right, is our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.159" offset="12932054">Now, the Government, the -- the Grand River Dam Authority not only adopted a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.946" offset="12959117">It set about to acquire the lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.043" offset="12967581">And it acquired all the lands necessary to build the Pensacola unit which was the big head water unit that would be the big reservoir, that would release the water to flow down the stream to turn the turbines of the downstream generating plants and was, incidentally and under specific authority of the Act, cooperative with the Federal Government and the Corps of Engineers in flood control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.866" offset="13082833">And the top five feet of that reservoir are reserved and these are the waters that are controlled by the regulations promulgated by the Corps of Engineers referred to by the Solicitor General and not the power too, but the flood control waters, the release of the flood control waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.117" offset="13163813">These are further regulated by the Federal Power of Commission under its authority which extends to all tributaries of -- of navigable streams, likewise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.359" offset="13208848">Now, the Grand River Dam Authority then built the Pensacola Dam at the cost of approximately $20,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.922" offset="13251062">It put in its hydroelectric development equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.057" offset="13271646">It obtained rights of way and built a 110 volt transmission line, a 110 kV transmission line down to the site which it acquired for the building of the Markham Ferry Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.543" offset="13341550">And then it extended this transmission line on, actually, built it down to the Ft. Gibson dam site.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.486" offset="13373315">And it acquired the certain fast lands and rights of way in -- in that vicinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.834" offset="13398706">So, it was moving forward to -- to accomplish its purpose and to carry out its plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.389" offset="13432978">Legislature had given it authority to ---to borrow moneys, to borrow $10, 000,000 additional money specifically for the purpose of building the Markham Ferry and the -- the Ft. Gibson Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.547" offset="13501524">And then along came the Corps of Engineers and made another study of the water shed and they did a complete reversal of their previous recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.650" offset="13545932">They recommended that the Federal Government do exactly what the Grand River Dam Authority was in the process of doing and had already partially accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.604" offset="13585742">This was the Flood Control Act of 1941 which is cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.230" offset="13612283">Well, there was naturally a great deal of confusion at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.734" offset="13630360">I might say that in -- in House Document Number 107, the report of the Corps of Engineers that is referred to in the Flood Control Act of 1941 authorizing the Federal Government to build not only the Ft. Gibson Dam but the Markham Ferry Dam and the Pensacola Dam which had already been built.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.888" offset="13718967">That document refers to the fact that the State of Oklahoma through the Grand River Dam Authority was already attempting to accomplish this very same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.391" offset="13756897">Yet in spite of that, the Corps of Engineers went ahead with their plan to superimpose on their plan upon what this -- the Grand River Dam Authority was doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3496.557" offset="14089592">Now, then came the war, the emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.800" offset="14106624">And the Federal Government took this property over under its emergency powers, which made it impossible, for the Grand River Dam Authority to proceed as long as it was -- as these properties were under the control of and the active management of the -- of the War Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.858" offset="14178826">In 1946, the properties were returned to the State of Oklahoma or to the Grand River Dam Authority and shortly after that or at about that time the Corps of Engineers started forward with the construction of the Ft. Gibson dam site.</text>

            <text syncTime="3852.436" offset="15513161">The -- the Federal Government was granted the authority to go up on these lands and build military roads and posts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.109" offset="15543777">And a further reversionary clause which said that if the Cherokee Nation ever ceased in being, that the lands would revert to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.206" offset="15588185">In 1893, the Act of -- the first Allotment Act of the Cherokees in 1893, I think it was April the 2nd, 1893, we have cited in the brief, the United States withdrew by Act of Congress it's reversionary interest in these lands in order that they could be allotted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.886" offset="15702915">And under that authority and the -- and the authority of subsequent acts, these lands were allotted to the members of the Cherokee tribe who were entitled to them and to their freedom, alloted in several and at the time Oklahoma became a State, these lands had been so allotted and title was vested in the individual Indians who were holding that land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.862" offset="15822869">The Indian Territory was governed by Act of Congress or was administered by Act of Congress which imposed upon the Indian Territory, the common law provisions of the State of Arkansas as set forth Mansfield's Digest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.467" offset="15909282">This was the riparian right doctrine, that is familiar since the time of Blackstone and insofar as riparian rights are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.805" offset="15950555">And this was the law that governed the Indian Territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.607" offset="15969782">Oklahoma Territory as distinguished from Indian Territory had been authorized to set up a legislature and govern itself through an appointed governor in an elected legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.377" offset="16020877">And it adopted laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.016" offset="16031431">It adopted a set of laws which are referred to in the brief and now appear in Title 82 of the 1952 annotated statutes of the State of Oklahoma and are a basic part of the Water Code of Oklahoma today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.347" offset="16108753">In Section 2, the schedule of the constitution of Oklahoma which was drawn up under the authority of the Enabling Act which made Oklahoma -- made it possible for Oklahoma to become a State, provided that the laws of Oklahoma Territory would at the moment of statehood be enforced in the new State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.175" offset="16204048">So, those statutory provisions of Oklahoma Territory were imposed upon and became the laws governing the water rights in what had formerly been the Cherokee Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.525" offset="16257442">In Oklahoma versus Texas; which this Court decided the boundary between Oklahoma and Texas, in the case which is not cited in the brief the Brewer-Elliott Oil Company versus the United States at 260 U.S. 77, both of those cases go to some length in pointing out that Oklahoma having been admitted to the Union on an equal footing with the original States, acquired all of the property that the original States had likewise acquired or had in being at the time that they became States in the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.007" offset="16431417">And all of the rights that were -- were given to the States under the provisions of the Constitution and were not reserved to the Federal Government itself by the specific terms of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.895" offset="16490977">The -- the -- therefore, we say that as a result of these acts, the State of Oklahoma, the people of the State of Oklahoma own the control of the waters in the nonnavigable Grand River and acting through their legislature they appropriated these waters to their agency; the Grand River Dam Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.666" offset="16598079">Now, the Solicitor General has pointed out that there were certain reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4128.913" offset="16618977">There were laws which restricted the -- the conveyance of property by the Indians who had the fee title.</text>
            <text syncTime="4138.742" offset="16658369">The Nation had the free title, Cherokee Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.278" offset="16672475">Cherokee Nation passed this free title, all of the patents, all of the deeds given by the Cherokee Nation were authenticated by the Secretary of Interior to the several Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.479" offset="16721272">He says that -- that he implies that there is some further, indefinite extension of the powers of the Federal Government over the waters of the Grand River as a result of these restrictions on -- on the conveyance of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.794" offset="16806536">Well, Chief Justice Marshall held in a very early opinion that -- that the Indians were to be looked upon as -- as a -- as being in a sort of pupilage category as he calls them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.261" offset="16856377">The guardianship that the Federal Government has exercised over the Indians is -- is well-known.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.333" offset="16888665">Well-known to those of us from Oklahoma who have struggled with -- through our -- all of the titles to our land through these -- these many, many provisions of law and provisions of treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.420" offset="16937044">But that did not affect the fee titles of the land as wards of the Government, the Federal Government on these whole certain conditions that they couldn't throw away their land or they couldn't have it stolen from them or they couldn't have it taken from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.921" offset="16999006">And it set itself up as a guardian and -- and all of the administrative acts that they had accomplished was for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.757" offset="17030353">We say that as a result of the admission of Oklahoma as a State in the Union on equal footing with the original States that we acquired the right to do -- the legislature required the right to do what it has done here, namely to, appropriate these waters to the Grand River Dam Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.176" offset="17108093">Having so appropriated these waters to the Grand River Dam Authority, having extended to the Grand River Dam Authority an exclusive franchise for the development of power, this authority has vested property rights in the water and in the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.122" offset="17211852">Now, had it put it to beneficial use, we -- we don't concede that under legislative appropriation, it's necessary to have put it to beneficial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.864" offset="17246856">But the facts of this case will clearly demonstrate that the water was being put to beneficial use to the extent that this authority could physically move forward and accomplish the things that it was set out to accomplish and build the units that its plan called for (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="6597.680" offset="26494098">That is correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="6615.330" offset="26564733">Well, I don't -- I think that's all resolved in the denial of their claim with the Federal Power Commission, but you -- the further fact that you should know that it's in our brief is that the Markham Ferry Dam was allotted by the Federal Power Commission to the Government to build and then Congress decided to have the authority build it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6636.947" offset="26651146">So, Congress has resolved the question, the political question there about who should build the Ft.Gibson by not interfering with the Federal Power Commission's action there, but interfering on the Markham Ferry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6652.075" offset="26711646">Now, they have also --</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="6652.803" offset="26714572">So this is a value of those plans, no dams would be left.</text>
            <text syncTime="6658.060" offset="26735574">The authority can, if not a compensable pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="6663.095" offset="26755741">That's -- I guess (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="6664.752" offset="26762428">Well, there's a $6,500,000, we'd say it tell about in the footnote that Congress has voted as an appropriation for them with the release connected to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6675.822" offset="26806627">They haven't taken it yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="6677.169" offset="26812061">So, the Government doesn't say that it binds.</text>
            <text syncTime="6680.105" offset="26823764">But they have that provision that apparently Congress has worked out as some kind of a settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6686.069" offset="26847692">Now, it --</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="6686.839" offset="26850722">That was all like damage to the residue idea.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="6689.652" stopTime="7001.328">
            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="6689.652" offset="26862007">Apparently.</text>
            <text syncTime="6690.871" offset="26866813">Now, it -- I want to clear here too that the Government has not overreached anybody in this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6697.507" offset="26893354">The Pensacola Dam cost something like $20,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="6702.319" offset="26912684">$8,500,000 of it was an outright grant to the authority from the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6709.465" offset="26941210">And as a part of WPA, $12,000,000 was a loan from the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6716.369" offset="26968900">So, that much has all come out of Uncle Sam and now we're -- the Congress has voted $6,500,000 additional to try to make up to the many difficulties they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="6728.784" offset="27018533">Now (Inaudible) that Congress examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="6732.508" offset="27033370">They've -- it required because of the building of this dam, the way it was, that they put their waterline differently than they'd it before and they gave them the money to take care of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6744.039" offset="27079555">So, the Congress has tried to take care of these various problems and resolve them in a political area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6750.890" offset="27106931">Now, on regard to the Indian deeds, I don't see yet how they ever get the title to this water that they say the water right is in the allottees and the Indian Nation over to anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="6764.867" offset="27162833">For example, in my State of Nebraska, there are all kinds of Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="6769.442" offset="27181119">I don't know of any power on the part of the State of Nebraska when it became a State, changed from a territory into a State to automatically take those Indian lands and make them belong to the -- the State of Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="6783.369" offset="27236812">There isn't any such power that's ever been recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="6786.297" offset="27248515">Now, as far as equal footing is concerned, all through the eastern state this Court has held up time -- held time after time that people continued to have their riparian rights, and no State that I know of, has claimed under the right of equal footing or any other constitutional power, the right to take the riparian rights of people that have had them even before the country was established, away from them, just because they were created a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="6818.182" offset="27376097">They've recognized that under the common law those riparian rights were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6822.388" offset="27392920">They were a property right and they continue to enjoy them over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6826.881" offset="27410892">And how or any other State could -- it's got to have some right far greater and different than the equal footing or treating like the other eastern state, the 13 States of the Union in order to make any such claim as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6843.491" offset="27477347">Now, the position of the Government that if the title was in the United States, then they can't get it away from them just by some declaration of a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="6854.089" offset="27519770">And they can't get it away from the Indians or the wards of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6859.275" offset="27540459">And they cannot get it away from anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="6861.601" offset="27549759">Now, there is this problem about this matter and I want the Court to understand about the riparian and appropriative rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6871.117" offset="27587793">The riparian rights are the right to enjoy the flow of the river constantly coming down and if you want to divert that water, you've got to return it to the stream in substantially the same way less your reasonable use.</text>
            <text syncTime="6886.048" offset="27647561">And if you don't use it as a riparian, you've got to continue to let it go down to the next (Inaudible) until such time as you're ready to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6892.753" offset="27674415">In the meantime, there are all kinds of appropriative rights that are unappropriated yet because nobody has moved up to use them in that water that are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="6904.050" offset="27719555">And California is an ideal State.</text>
            <text syncTime="6906.030" offset="27727496">There are numbers of cases there in which they have recognized the proposition that there is a water right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6912.785" offset="27754559">The riparians can have rights on that same stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="6916.164" offset="27768038">If they don't exercise them, they're unappropriated water rights there that other people can file for according to state law and under the Desert Land Act and acquire those rights and have vested rights and there's no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6930.177" offset="27824044">So that both of them can live together, but there's none of that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6934.095" offset="27839718">There's no provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6935.533" offset="27845465">Now, the question that the Chief Justice asked here is basic to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6940.804" offset="27866572">It's whether or not, in every case where the United States wants to exercise the power that it has under the Commerce Clause, to provide through the Federal Power Commission for the construction of a dam on a nonnavigable river because it substantially affects commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6957.833" offset="27934699">That they have to pay a tribute, because someone has stepped up and gotten a license to build that dam and done nothing more, got a license and a statute passed through the legislature to get some water rights and done nothing more in regard to it except that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6976.898" offset="28010977">Then do you have to -- does the United States have to add that kind of value in order to get this facility built in the interest of the country?</text>
            <text syncTime="6984.962" offset="28043264">And I'd say it never should that there's no reason why that kind of value should be recognized under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
