            <text syncTime="20.309" offset="184613">The Government, however, wants to make it clear that it does not rest its case, dealing with the proposition that there is no judicial review here, on the language of Section 32, which is simply silent on the matter of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.014" offset="251382">Section 32 is simply one of some 40 odd sections of the Trading with the Enemy Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="47.706" offset="294222">Turning to other sections of the Act, we find at least two such sections which on their face would seem in sweeping language to bar judicial review under Section 32.</text>

            <text syncTime="202.584" offset="913742">Now in addition to that, there is a significant section which is found in our brief on page 33, Section 9 (f) of the Trading with the Enemy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.324" offset="980720">Section 9 (f) in part reads as follows “Except as herein provided the money or other property conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, paid to the Custodian shall not be subject to any order or decree of any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.576" offset="1069641">Now I think Section 9 (f) is particularly significant because Section 9 is the key section of the Trading with the Enemy Act insofar as a judicial review is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.768" offset="1210493">However, I'd like to point out that after World War I, Congress also enacted Sections 9 (b) and 9 (c) which allowed judicial review for enemy aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.695" offset="1270157">Now contrast to what Congress did after World War I when it specifically allowed judicial review in 9 (b) and 9 (c) with what Congress did after World War II when they enacted Section 32 and said nothing at all about judicial review.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.430" offset="1421040">That is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.842" offset="1426787">As the legislative -- to go into the legislative history, the legislative history indicates that the pattern that was envisaged for relief after World War II, so to speak, was a two-fold one.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.866" offset="1494810">First, under Section 9 (a), there was to be judicial review and so to speak a mandatory return for all non-enemy aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.746" offset="1542353">Section 9 (a) gave an absolute right of judicial review for them, but then as the -- as the Alien Property Custodian pointed out to the congressional committee, Section 32 was to provide, so to speak, another remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.730" offset="1610271">It was a remedy that might be utilized, if they so wish, by even by not enemy alien but it could also be utilized by enemy aliens, but because it could be utilized by enemy aliens, it was envisaged as one that was purely administrative.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.332" offset="1684668">It gave wide discretion to the administrator and there was to be no judicial review under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.435" offset="1717164">Now it's significant that Congress considered Section 32 for almost two years from 1944 to 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.917" offset="1754990">This was not something that was rushed through Congress under great war of pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.592" offset="1777768">Congress took plenty of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.093" offset="1791770">Furthermore, the original of Section 32 (a) was legislation drafted by the Alien Property Custodian and the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.928" offset="1835133">They sent a joint letter which is found in our brief on pages 12 and 13 in which they state that the purpose of Section 32 (a) was to provide administrative remedy with wide discretion and that there was not to be any judicial review under Section 32 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="458.320" offset="1936697">This was not only their understanding, it was the understanding of witnesses who appeared before the congressional committee and who criticized, they then draft the 32 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="470.384" offset="1984867">For instance the testimony of Mr. Carroll which is found in our brief on pages 13 and 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.270" offset="2016423">In other words it was the general consensus of opinion that there was not to be a judicial review under 32 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="486.316" offset="2048606">Judicial review was to be under Section 9, not under 32, not under 32 (a).</text>

            <text syncTime="645.029" offset="2683486">That is quite true.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.578" offset="2689651">Now there's also significance that Section 32 (a) when it was enacted by Congress was part of Public Law 322 and that law contained other amendments to the Trading with the Enemy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.960" offset="2751195">One of those amendments related to Section 22 which deals with consulting and that amendment enacted at the same time Section 32 (a), that amendment is Section 20 expressly provided for judicial review under Section 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.747" offset="2830399">In other words that's a pretty clear indication that whenever Congress has wanted a judicial review under the Trading with the Enemy Act they had said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.411" offset="2869060">And the reason they had said so is because undoubtedly they realized that they didn't say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.585" offset="2889749">Then the provisions of 7 (c) and 9 (f) would operate to bar a review.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.289" offset="2916498">Now you find the same pattern again when a few months later in August, 1946, Congress amended Section 32 (a) and enacted the proviso herein question dealing with discrimination against groups for political reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.054" offset="2995597">First of all you discover as we point out in our brief on pages 16 and 17 that the Alien Property Custodian wrote a letter to determine in the House Judiciary Committee which the Chairman read with his approval to the House in which the Alien Property Custodian pointed out that he wanted to make it clear that certain amendments and changes that the Senate had made in Section 33 which deal with the statute of limitations that none of those amendments and changes in his judgment operated to give any judicial review under Section 32 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="769.567" offset="3181589">The amendments as a matter of fact of Section 32 (a) said again did not deal with judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.032" offset="3211473">Furthermore, these August amendments again were part of Public Law Number 671.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.145" offset="3239999">Public Law 671 made other changes to the Trading with the Enemy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.006" offset="3263404">One of those changes was that it added Section 34 to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.720" offset="3286288">Now Section 34 deals with the so-called death claim, that is the claims of American citizens against the properties that have been -- have been seized by the Alien Property Custodian and again it is significant that Section 34, as added here in 1946 of August, specifically provides for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.841" offset="3418781">The matter's not left up in the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.077" offset="3431633">In other words, every time Congress has wanted judicial review under the Trading with the Enemy Act it has said so expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.717" offset="3470190">It said so in Section 9, it said so in Section 20, it said so Section 34 as we point out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.678" offset="3510105">Since 1946 on at least two occasions bills have been introduced in Congress to amend Section 32 (a) to provide expressly for judicial review, none of those bills have ever been enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.603" offset="3585755">Now turning to for a moment from the legislative history and from the wording of the Trading with the Enemy Act, it also seems to the Government that there were very sound policy reasons that undoubtedly influenced Congress here not to desire to have judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.356" offset="3684812">Congress probably realized that they were not dealing here with a statute which would involve the liberty of any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.530" offset="3733504">There was no question here of imprisonment, no question here of deportation, no question here of putting anyone in the armed forces against his will of drafting anybody for service.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.482" offset="3785331">There's no question here as I made plain of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.917" offset="3802990">There is no question here of any administrative body blackening anybody's reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.292" offset="3832560">There is no question here of depriving anyone of the right to vote or the right of free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.609" offset="3861817">Congress undoubtedly viewed this proposition simply as an act of grace.</text>

            <text syncTime="2496.042" offset="10087528">I will just confine my rebuttal to the statements made by Mr. Kramer on the point that the legislative history and particularly the fact that Section 34 was added to the Trading with the Enemy Act at the time they added the first proviso from Section 32 (a) (2) (D) has really nothing to do with the question before the Court because the purpose of incorporating the right to sue in Section 34, the debt claim provision review by the Court of a debt claim determination was clearly pointed out in the hearings before -- it's not on my brief, in the hearings before the Subcommittee No. 1 and Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, 79th Congress on House Bill 5089, a Bill to amend the First War Powers Act, Serial No. 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.017" offset="10343424">And it is there stated by Mr. Markham, who was then the Custodian, that in view of this Court's decision in Markham v. Cabell which had held that one could sue the Custodian under Section 9 (a) to recover from the vested property a debt owing to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.851" offset="10458781">There would be a first-come, first-serve situation as far as payment of the debt claims were concerned, so the Custodian asked legislation to take away from Section 9 (a), and it's in 9 (a) there is the provision that any person not an enemy or ally of an enemies, it's on page 42, claiming or to whom any debt may be owing from an enemy or ally of an enemy whose property or any part thereof shall have been conveyed to the Custodian may sue the Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States to recover on his debt out of the vested property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.329" offset="10648639">They took that away in enacting Section 34 and allowed the creditor to come-in in an administrative proceeding and if he was dissatisfied with the administrative proceeding there could then be an equitable distribution of the vested assets owing by the former property owner to his creditors who are not enemies or allies of enemies and Section 34 is based on the National Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.007" offset="10791372">There's a system of equitable distribution and review by the courts of the mere fact that they did that in the same Act which incorporated the first proviso is no indication and no proof that Congress did not intend that there should be no judicial review of any determination by the Custodian which was without supporting evidence or arbitrary or capricious or void.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.478" offset="10929298">That is to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.284" offset="10932537">Now as to the real point here on Section 32, when it says “may return” in the first part, the word “may” relates solely to the return of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.772" offset="11022503">The word “may” does not relate to a determination of the status or the condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.203" offset="11056149">He is not given a permissive right to determine whether the man comes within the conditions laid down for return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.735" offset="11106304">“May” in that sense must be read as “shall” or mandatory because the word “may” has been construed in a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.446" offset="11149145">It has been construed by this Court and other courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.322" offset="11164609">The word “may” is to be read as mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.363" offset="11184776">It means shall or must whenever it is necessary to carry out the intent of the legislature that has enacted the particular statute in which the word is found and to carry out the sense of the policy of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.799" offset="11258546">Now Congress in our brief quotes Congress on the sense and purpose of the first proviso of Section 32 (a) (2) (D).</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.297" offset="11304521">Congress considered these people who were persecuted as non-hostile enemies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.862" offset="11346840">Congress said we call them the enemies of our enemies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.016" offset="11375470">They, in fact, wanted to have the allied course succeed they should have their property back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.822" offset="11406712">That's the exact language of Congress in the reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.619" offset="11421863">Since that is the sense and the purpose and intent of the legislature to give these people back their property if they come within this class, then I suggest to the Court that the word “may” which only relates to return if it has any application or consideration with respect to the determination of status or condition, I say it should then be read as mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.982" offset="11559267">And my last point, if the Court please, is, that the issue here is not the expertise of the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.147" offset="11619976">He is not an expert on what were considered political, religious, or racial groups no more than I have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.070" offset="11667623">He must determine that on the facts adduced on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.534" offset="11697507">There were facts adduced here on the record before the hearing examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.471" offset="11721226">The hearing examiner said though evidence was documentary and only one witness was called by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.946" offset="11763127">He names that witness in his recommendation and findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.500" offset="11801370">That witness is named M. Magdalena Shack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.124" offset="11819865">Although it does not appear here, I doubt whether the Government will deny that M. Magdalena Shack is an employee and attorney in the Office of Alien Property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.355" offset="11876812">So if there is any expertise in the office of Alien Property to determine this question, M. Magdalena Shack, an employee of that office, a former lawyer in Germany, arium, and who had taught one semester at Harvard law school, who was the witness here before the hearing examiner and who testified to the conditions in Germany and as to what the political groups and knew who the bar examiners were and the chief of the bar examiners then I say we have in the records the expert in the office of Alien Property that supported the case of the petitioner which evidence was disregarded by the Director when he made his decision and we say that was arbitrary, capricious, and void and if it's void, the District Court has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.786" offset="12150471">It has jurisdiction to control not to decide, but to control void acts of an agency.</text>
