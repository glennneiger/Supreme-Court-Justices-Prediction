            <label>Mr. Clark M. Clifford</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">With very few minutes I have, I shall direct myself quickly and briefly to two points that have been under discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.337" offset="152743">The first is discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.863" offset="166849">I submit that no matter how it's treated or how many words you burry it under, this situation is present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.952" offset="207182">If the Federal Government owns a piece of property on this side of the road and the State of Texas owns a piece of property on this side of the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.521" offset="257442">Under this statute, Texas contends that when the Federal Government leases that property, the lessee pays a tax if it's for less than three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.810" offset="306657">Over here on this side of the road, if a lessee leases the State property and it's under three years, he pays no tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.626" offset="341870">Now, we can not get away from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.011" offset="351378">Let me broaden that out from that simple illustration the one that the Chief Justice has mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.774" offset="378441">50 miles away from us is the Pantex Ordnance Plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.703" offset="398190">Part of that the Government recaptured.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.318" offset="408639">Part of it, they sold to the State of Texas, they sold the fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.068" offset="431626">And the State of Texas now owns, down at the Pantex Plant, an area of ground there.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.231" offset="468302">It is property, that is public property of the State of Texas and it's held by the Texas Technological College as an agency of the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.801" offset="510621">The reply brief shows in the Attorney General's opinion that down there on the Pantex ground, which is owned and fee by the State of Texas, there are 3 large warehouses and 102 small warehouses, they call “igloos.”</text>
            <text syncTime="118.082" offset="575718">Those are lease to Phillips and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.256" offset="592436">Now, mind you, at the Cactus Ordnance Plant, the one that is involved in this case, there are also great many warehouses there and they're all listed in that description of property that went on the tax rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.346" offset="656802">So, when the tax is directed against Phillips as they attempt to do here on the Cactus plant, the one in this case, Phillips must pay a tax on all of the warehouses that are present on the Cactus Ordnance property.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.440" offset="737155">That's what they contend here.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.654" offset="746036">Where 50 miles away, the warehouses, similar types of warehouses that Phillips rents from the State of Texas through the Texas Technological College, they pay no tax on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.012" offset="807372">And I submit to you, when Phillips wants some warehouses and the State has some warehouses to offer and the Federal Government has some warehouses to offer, and they both come to Phillips, the Federal Government says, “Our warehouses cost this amount.”</text>
            <text syncTime="192.717" offset="874245">And State of Texas says, “Well, take our warehouses, because if you take the Federal Government's warehouses, you're going to have to pay a substantial tax to State of Texas on those federal warehouses.”</text>
            <text syncTime="205.370" offset="924818">Now, it comes down to that, and mind you, if Your Honor please, there is nothing in law 5248 that says, “It is confined to industrial plants or ordnance works or anything of that kind.”</text>
            <text syncTime="220.285" offset="984482">It says, “Any property owned by the Federal Government in the State of Texas and if that's leased out, then, a tax attaches to that property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="232.754" offset="1034428">There, I submit is the clear discrimination in the --</text>

            <text syncTime="503.532" offset="2117465">Look, if you will, please at the part on page 44 that reads, “The State of Texas earnestly submit one, there is a rational basis for the classification in question.”</text>

            <text syncTime="550.865" offset="2306800">There is the reason they say for this classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.120" offset="2323832">I -- I believe it's what we've contended.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.596" offset="2333759">Down at the bottom of that page 44, the different tax treatment, mind you, there is the recognition again, the different tax treatment of lessees of State and federal property comports with Texas public policy by facilitating fiscal considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.997" offset="2411395">I submit, it certainly does facilitate fiscal considerations for the State of Texas but it places a very serious burden upon the Federal Government in its efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.402" offset="2456952">And I submit at this point, a felicitous phrase was used by Mr. Justice Brennan when he said in the Allied Stores case.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.110" offset="2487777">“This places a burden upon federalism.”</text>
            <text syncTime="599.473" offset="2501256">And that's what we're talking about, the burden that's being placed upon the United States Government by this specific action that signals out lessees of federal property and places this burden upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.398" offset="2552978">Over on page 45, this last one at the top, and says the case -- in this case there is no question but to the appellant's interest in tax that I wish to read.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.701" offset="2598222">“It would be extremely on just to allow the appellant to escape its proportionate share of the tax burden merely by a reason of the slight difference in tax treatment between federal and state lessee.”</text>
            <text syncTime="634.999" offset="2643362">Mind you, the tax on the federal lessee has grown now with reference to this Cactus Plant was a very substantial method well over million dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.944" offset="2691114">Similar lessees, no tax at all, that's called a very slight difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.059" offset="2711594">And in that regard, we're just starting, if Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.373" offset="2728835">This is the first tax, this tax had been imposed by the Dumas Independent School District, waiting in the wings are the county and the state who vindicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.534" offset="2769481">They are ready also to assess taxes on the property which I guess they'd have to under the law, if the statute is held constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.747" offset="2802395">And let me submit one thing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.860" offset="2810859">The ramifications that flow from a -- a sustaining of the constitutionality of this statute, I submit perhaps would be beyond the imagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.847" offset="2858715">If this statute was sustained and the State of Texas can signal out federal lessees and tax them and -- and not tax State lessees, I think it is reasonable assumption that one state after another will start in and pass similar statute taxing lessees of federal property, and the burden then on the Federal Government will become a norm.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.954" offset="2967176">How can the Federal Government conduct its business in the handling of its property which it has given a right to and a supreme right under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, when the various States are permitted to signal out federal lessees and penalize them and permit State lessees to go free of taxation?</text>

            <text syncTime="739.237" offset="3060276">Does your argument go to this extent that anything that Federal Government sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.157" offset="3087966">Now, this is -- I understand your point that for this is own federal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.874" offset="3114820">But, let's assume it's owned property that the Federal Government has sold out of it's hand and no longer have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.698" offset="3150137">Suppose the State should decide that it wanted to have a law that any property that has been formerly owned by the Federal Government should bear one tax, the property owned by -- formerly owned by other people that should bear another tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="794.480" offset="3281272">What is behind it?</text>
            <text syncTime="796.025" offset="3287437">It is entirely possible that if a new classification were carved out for lessees of property formerly owned by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.639" offset="3325889">It might be that they would be discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.375" offset="3340831">And in that instance, they might be deprived of the Equal Protection Clause for the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.564" offset="3361625">That would be entirely conceivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.594" offset="3369775">But in this particular instance, I am saying it is the burden that is placed upon the Federal Government, so that that of course negatives property which is no longer owned by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.708" offset="3418154">But in this instance, we submit that when the Federal Government owns property and it's leased and that burden is placed upon the Federal Government and it's lessee, it makes that law of the State of Texas unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="841.135" offset="3467891">Suppose the State should pass a law that any grocery company buying from other companies, wholesalers or distributors that had a capital stock of more than $100 million should be taxed at one amount and those who bought groceries from someone else would be taxed for the smaller amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.348" offset="3584815">Would that in judgement be anything like the kind of discrimination which what exists here if the state is really taxing something that the lessee owns?</text>
