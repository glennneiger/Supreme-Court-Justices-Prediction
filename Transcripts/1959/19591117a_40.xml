            <text syncTime="42.403" offset="273011">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.590" offset="293700">I represent the Phillips Chemical Company, the appellant in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.391" offset="316897">The respondent or appellee is the Dumas Independent School District in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.460" offset="349184">The Federal Government has intervened us amicus curiae as has the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.795" offset="378546">In 1950, the state legislature in Texas passed a law having to do with the taxing of lessees of federal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.720" offset="430268">The Supreme Court of Texas construed that law as permitting the Dumas Independent School District to asses a tax against Phillips Chemical Company on federal property which it leased and based that tax on the full fee value of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.817" offset="518666">The Phillips Chemical Company below attacked the constitutionality of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.739" offset="542281">It was sustained by the Supreme Court of Texas and this appeal follows to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.812" offset="570598">The facts are simple and undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.428" offset="597034">During World War II, the Federal Government built an ordnance plant in Moore County, Texas and called it the Cactus Ordnance Works.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.655" offset="646040">It operated during the war and made explosives there.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.919" offset="658996">After the war was over, the Government did not wish to sell the plant, they wanted to keep it in the ownership of the Federal Government in the event that at some future time they might wish to use it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.464" offset="717197">So they leased the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.362" offset="728795">And in 1948, the Federal Government, which owned the fee of the plant, leased the plant to Phillips Chemical Company for a primary period of 15 years with right of renewal.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.152" offset="792012">The rental on the plant was in excess of $1 million per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.505" offset="817403">Also, the Government can cancel the lease at anytime that it chooses on giving 90 days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.629" offset="853870">If it desires to sell the plant, the Government can also cancel a lease on 30 days notice in the event of a national emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.683" offset="890128">Now in 1950, the Legislature of Texas passed a law that United States property would be subject to taxation if used by a private party in its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.545" offset="945507">Now from 1950 to 1954, nothing occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.188" offset="964106">Everybody went along in their usual manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.449" offset="973197">But in 1954, the School District, I'll refer to it as that, levied a tax against Phillips based on the full fee value of the Cactus Ordnance Works.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.338" offset="1028681">Phillips was operating the plant as an anhydrous ammonia plant which, as Your Honors know, is used in commercial fertilizer.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.568" offset="1069641">Now after the assessor assessed that tax against Phillips based on the full fee value of the plant, Phillips filed suit in the state court in Texas to have the assessment cancelled and to enjoin the collector from collecting the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.488" offset="1137351">The lower court denied relief as did the Intermediate Court of Civil Appeals.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="262.860" offset="1154800">What if they didn't know what (Inaudible)?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="clark_m_clifford" startTime="266.216" stopTime="475.336">
            <label>Mr. Clark M. Clifford</label>
            <text syncTime="266.216" offset="1168280">We do not know, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.353" offset="1176743">No explanation appears to that -- of that, as far as I know none appears in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.300" offset="1200567">The case then after going from the Court of Civil Appeals went to the Supreme Court of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.365" offset="1228884">There the validity of the statute was upheld, but at that time, out of the nine judges of that Court, four dissented strenuously and they dissented on the ground that this statute was flagrantly, grossly discriminatory insofar as the Federal Government and its lessees are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.347" offset="1328776">Now below briefly the contentions of Phillips Phillips showed in the trial below that lessees of non federal exempt property paid no tax at all if the lease was for under three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.425" offset="1401083">And they paid the tax based only on the leasehold if the term of the lease was for more than three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.490" offset="1437341">So Phillips said in view of what the other lessees of tax-exempt property were -- were subjected to in Texas that it was invalid and unconstitutional for the legislature to select just the lessees of federal property and subject them to a tax based on the full fee value of the property which they were leasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.774" offset="1530441">We present but two questions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.915" offset="1547055">One, the 1950 Texas law is invalid for it is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.119" offset="1579865">It discriminates against the United States and those with whom it deals.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.975" offset="1599300">It imposes a burden on the activities of the Federal Government and infringes upon its sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.458" offset="1625213">It also violates the Due Process and the Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.240" offset="1652381">That is our first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.936" offset="1659068">Our second point is the law is invalid for it imposes an ad valorem tax upon the federal property and interferes with the sovereign right of the Government over its property in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.911" offset="1719045">Now the argument if you please and I address myself solely to the point number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.289" offset="1736495">Simply point number one is the tax is discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.887" offset="1754885">Now we must refer, if Your Honors will please, to the statute in question or it will be referred to a good many times in the course of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.145" offset="1791979">I refer you to page 12 of the appellant's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.168" offset="1836074">Briefly it will be noted, it says in substance to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.571" offset="1849657">“The United States shall be secure in their possession and enjoyment of all lands acquired under the provisions of this type, and such lands and all improvements thereon should be exempt from any taxation under the authority of the state so long as the same are held, owned, used, and occupied by the United States for the purposes expressed in this title and not otherwise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="458.030" offset="1935444">Let me stop and say that down to this point that had been in the law of Texas for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.052" offset="1963551">But in 1950, the Legislature of Texas amended it to add the following language which appears in -- on the page 12.</text>

            <label>Mr. Clark M. Clifford</label>
            <text syncTime="482.864" offset="2034813">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.844" offset="2046725">Provided further that any portion of said lands and improvements which is use and occupied by any person, firm, and association of persons or corporation in its private capacity or which is being used or occupied in the conduct of any private business or enterprise shall be subjected to taxation by this State and its political subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.602" offset="2133765">It will be noted that the language of the statute refers only to the United States and refers only to the lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.619" offset="2177860">It says “occupiers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="519.804" offset="2182562">I'll use the term lessee because they're practically all on leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.799" offset="2198549">This statute points directly and unequivocally to the United States and its lessees and points to no one else.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.776" offset="2234493">Now if you are to understand the degree of the discrimination, it is important that you be familiar with the existence -- with the law that existed in Texas before the statute was passed in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.922" offset="2295097">There were but two sections that Texas law that had to do with lessees of tax-exempt property.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.191" offset="2328116">7173, which said, that lessees of tax-exempt property, if their term is for less than three years, they pay no tax on the tax-exempt property, and 7174, which in effect says, “If the lease of tax-exempt property is for more than three years, then the lessee shall pay a tax based only on the value of the leasehold,” not on the value-to-be, only on the value of the leasehold, another important element.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.353" offset="2480776">Many years ago, the Texas Supreme Court construed those statutes to mean also that if a lease had in it a cancellation clause which permitted the lessor to cancel at his discretion, then it would be considered to be a lease for under three years, no matter what the term might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.283" offset="2580459">So if the lessor could cancel it anytime, obviously, it is not a definite obligation of three years or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.039" offset="2611493">So here is the picture that existed prior to the passage of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.319" offset="2636675">Here is a large classification of tax-exempt lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.768" offset="2666454">It included all lessees of tax-exempt property, lessees of federal property, state, county, municipal, irrigation districts, every lessee of tax-exempt property was included in this great large classification and that had existed for 70 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.756" offset="2750360">So what the legislature did in 1950 was just carve into this long-term classification of lessees, they carved into that and extracted from it just the lessees of federal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.814" offset="2830608">And so the Court said, what then happens to the lessees of federal property now that they've been carved out of this classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.631" offset="2865925">The Supreme Court of Texas held that with a federal lessee, if his term of lease is less than three years, he pays a tax based on the full value of the fee, whereas back in the old classification, all other lessees of tax-exempt property paid no tax at all if the lease was for less than three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.966" offset="2975222">Over here, if a lessee of federal property had a term of more than three years, it made no difference to him, he still pay the tax base on the full value of the fee, while over in the old classification, lessees of other tax-exempt property in excess of three years, they paid a tax only based on the value of the leasehold and not on the value of the fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.237" offset="3092355">So that when that was made clear as it was below, four of the justices of the Supreme Court said, “This appears to be a very definite, direct discrimination against the Government of the United States and its lessees, and they so dissented claiming that it was repugnant to the Constitution and we submit repugnant to both the letter and the spirit of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.460" offset="3209174">Now, I believe the question enters one's mind, that if it appears so clear as it does that the Legislature just took one specific group and assessed this very substantial tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.359" offset="3276779">For instance, Phillips Chemical Company leased this plant, this plant was valued at a very large sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.599" offset="3305723">Yet the assessor says, “Although you just -- you have a lease and the Government can cancel that lease anytime, yet you've got to pay a tax based on the full fee value of that property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="813.108" offset="3355773">And Phillips says, “How about all these fellows that we used to be with over here and they don't pay any tax?”</text>
            <text syncTime="818.050" offset="3375522">“We don't care.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.879" offset="3378866">This is a law that the Legislature passed in 1950.”</text>
            <text syncTime="822.919" offset="3395062">Now, the judges below, the five who sustained the validity, how were they able to overcome this direct and unequivocal discrimination?</text>
            <text syncTime="837.771" offset="3454412">Well there were some three or four bases that they offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.701" offset="3478131">Now the one that they seem to attach the most importance to was, they said, why this tax, that this statute in 1950, is constitutional, because the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that this kind of statute is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.721" offset="3546258">And they said, “All you have to do is look at the case of Borg-Warner.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.110" offset="3567783">Borg-Warner, Your Honors will recall, is one of the three cases decided by this Court in the 1937 term, and it was the Borg-Warner case, the Continental Motors case, and the Murray Corporation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.211" offset="3624208">And in those cases or the first, the Borg-Warner, is the one they depend on mostly because it is closest in perhaps facts to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.919" offset="3663078">In the Borg-Warner case, Michigan passed a statute and that statute required a lessee of property and a lessee of federal property to pay a tax based on the full value of the property that it leased from the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.499" offset="3741341">Therefore, these five gentlemen in Texas, they see there, in the Borg-Warner case, the Supreme Court said, “a State passes a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.603" offset="3777808">It permits that State to level a tax against the lessee of federal property and it permits us to level the tax on the basis of the value of the property which the lessee got from the Government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="933.192" offset="3836113">Now what -- I submit -- what they failed to consider or what they chose to disregard was the fact that in those cases and in the -- particularly the Borg-Warner which was the first of the three cases and the lead of the three cases, this Court held very clearly that such tax as it approved in -- in that Borg-Warner case, the Michigan statute, that that tax was approved only on the basis that it was nondiscriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.374" offset="3988877">That it applied to all lessees of all tax-exempt property and didn't single any particular group of lessees out.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.364" offset="4028792">For instance on page 14 of our brief, we show where the majority of the court below said, “The Borg-Warner case clearly upholds the validity of the taxes assessed by the School District against Phillips insofar as the Federal Constitution and the laws are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.472" offset="4121266">But the difference between the Michigan statute and the Texas statute seems to me that they immediately revealed upon reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.992" offset="4159300">The Texas statute says, “Lessees of federal property shall pay this tax based on the value of the fee.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.963" offset="4191274">Whereas, the Michigan statute said, “All lessees of any types of tax-exempt property shall pay a use tax they call it upon the use of the property and engaging the amount of the tax, you may base it upon the value of the property which they have.</text>

            <text syncTime="1232.735" offset="5034297">Well, I -- I'm just saying that that Texas cannot discriminate against the Federal Government and impugn the sovereignty of the Federal Government and they cannot pass a law, in my opinion and in the opinion of the -- of the authorities here, that hold that the Federal Government will be discriminated against in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.603" offset="5133772">Now on that point, if I might carry it further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.304" offset="5148609">In the Borg-Warner case, after they discussed the fact that the Michigan statute permitted this tax, Mr. Justice Black, in speaking for the Court said, “It still remains true as it has from the beginning that a tax maybe invalid, even though it does not fall directly on the United States if it operates so as to discriminate against the Government or those with whom it deals.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.279" offset="5280475">They found however, in that Michigan case that the tax there, the Statute of Michigan, did not discriminate against the Government or those with whom it deals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.164" offset="5328018">Then again in the Borg-Warner case, the Michigan statute under attack subjected to taxation every private party who uses exempt property in Michigan in connection with the business conducted for private gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.256" offset="5396355">That's what they've found there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.219" offset="5404296">That under the Michigan statute, every private property who uses exempt property in Michigan in connection with the business conducted for private gain is covered by the Michigan statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.012" offset="5447450">And in addition, the Court observes still speaking through Mr. Justice Black, there was no showing that the tax is, in fact, administered to discriminate against those using federal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.184" offset="5508159">To the contrary, undisputed evidence introduced by appellees demonstrates that lessees of other exempt property have also been taxed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.036" offset="5551522">Here they held in the -- that this Court held in the Michigan case that the record shows that all lessees of tax-exempt property were subject to this tax and that the Federal Government had not been discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.134" offset="5615888">So they said, “All right”, you gentlemen said, “We will uphold that tax.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.307" offset="5636577">I suggest here that the absolute contrary is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.850" offset="5654758">Now certain other language of that gets maybe even a little closer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.302" offset="5672626">Mr. Justice Harlan, in his separate opinion, expressed the same view in a separate opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.674" offset="5702092">He said, “The state taxes here,” that's the Michigan tax, “do not operate in a discriminatory fashion by so measuring the tax or use on activities so as to impose an unequal tax burden on lessees or users of Government property, vis-à-vis lessees, users, or owners of other tax-exempt or non-exempt property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.411" offset="5824972">So it was – it was in the minds of this Court at the time that this Michigan tax must be studied carefully to see if it imposed an unequal tax burden on lessees of Government property, vis-à-vis, as Mr. Justice Harlan says, “lessees, users, or owners of other tax-exempt property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.691" offset="5926118">And the specific affirmative finding in that case was that the tax was not discriminatory because it fell upon this large group that I just spoke about, that is lessees of all types of tax-exempt property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.281" offset="5996544">They found that it did in the Michigan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.599" offset="6005739">I submit that in Texas, when you carve out the one group, lessees of federal property and you put them over there, and then say, this group can be taxed on the full fee value of the property on the authority of the Borg-Warner case, I submit that it's perhaps that the case just wasn't studied to the extent that it might have been studied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1612.737" offset="6554311">Now there were some three or four other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.697" offset="6566118">Mr. Justice Harlan, one was, the one that you mentioned that the state says, “This is a proper action on the part of the state to create a new classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.200" offset="6620139">There has been, in effect, this old classification of all of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1672.778" offset="6794533">Another point that the judges below said sustain their position was a 1947 statute, which said that lessees of plants, such as this and other government property, would be subjected to state taxes.</text>

If -- if Phillips -- Phillips has contended from the day the suit was filed that it owed no tax under this statute, contended that in the trial court, the intermediate court, the Supreme Court of Texas, said along, “We don't owe any tax under this statute.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2874.521" offset="11601481">Now under the Texas law, as interpreted by the Texas Supreme Court, a lessee from any person other than the Federal Government is not taxed upon his lease, not on the leasehold nor on the fee, unless he has a term of more than three years and then unless he is leasing from an exempt -- an exempt entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.882" offset="11726869">And that is to be contrasted with the type of situation here where the lease does not extend for over three years and where they are taxing upon the entire value of the -- of the enterprise.</text>

            <text syncTime="3351.596" offset="13509778">I think -- I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter that the state could classify, could make reasonable classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.242" offset="13540289">And if there were a factual basis for distinguishing apart from the immunity of the Federal Government from taxation, if there were a basis that they could find a point to where this was economically or from tax-wise or from the impact on the county a different problem, then you might be able to justify the classification but when the only basis for the classification would be that we cannot tax the United States, therefore we have to tax the lessees of the United States differently than we tax the other, I think that is not a reasonable classification for the Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.995" offset="13691382">Now, if it's not a reasonable classification for the Legislature, I think equally it cannot be for the Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3402.993" offset="13715310">Therefore, how about the factor that ought to be brought to this Circuit, namely that Uncle Sam is trying to lease it, for 15 years trying to lease it with the 30-day termination, (Inaudible) classify themselves with reference to other leases or other lessors in Texas that a classification maybe based on.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="3429.229" offset="13820322">Maybe -- maybe this Texas statute have a lot of knowledge that we haven't gotten.</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="3435.360" offset="13844773">Well, we -- we have some knowledge of what's going on in Texas even if it isn't in the record, because the Texas statutes themselves recognize that the State of Texas and its municipality is -- is deep in the real-estate field and in the field of -- of leasing commercial real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.393" offset="13932962">I refer specifically for example to the provisions with respect to air fields, the municipalities, town, cities and towns of Texas are authorized specifically to develop air fields and to lease the properties which they include in the air field to private companies for commercial purposes and not only for -- for terminal uses as a matter of fact but even for the manufacture of -- of and assembly of military (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.210" offset="14088234">So that here we have Texas itself authorizing its municipalities to go into this kind, if you want to call it, of leasing of municipal property for Government purposes with tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.113" offset="14143822">We've got the Legislature specifically authorizing it for the air fields, municipalities and the air fields, and denying it for the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.193" offset="14176110">And that's not the only example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.427" offset="14185096">The -- the court facilities are handled in the similar -- in a similar way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.124" offset="14211845">Those parts of the Houston Ship channel which didn't burn up the other day are being used now for commercial purposes and many of them much of it are under lease and this too is under statute, under the Texas statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.458" offset="14277256">The State -- the municipality called the Navigation District, develops this property and makes it available to commercial shipping companies, oil companies, cotton companies for commercial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.015" offset="14339427">And some of that is -- done on a -- on a license basis and some it's done on -- on a lease basis, but it's handed over to them for -- for their actual use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.520" offset="14373491">So, you don't really -- it's not case of Texas just leasing -- raising land or agricultural land, Texas is like the other States is -- is deep in this real-estate business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.242" offset="14440364">It occurs to me that the example what happened in New York recently is -- is pertinent to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.251" offset="14464397">After the decision of this Court in the Michigan cases, the State of New York passed a law which attempted to tax lessees, users in the same way that this Court had upheld in -- for the Michigan statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.364" offset="14532838">I said the Legislature passed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.178" offset="14544123">When the City of New York and -- and the Port Authority became aware of what was going on and that their properties, which they leased for commercial purposes, were going to be subject to lease, they (Inaudible), and it affected the bonds, it affected their whole financial setup.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.291" offset="14612564">And they took themselves all in a hurry because this equal taxation was going -- was going to hit them pretty hard and the statute was -- was vetoed by -- by the Governor of -- of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.865" offset="14662823">And I think that illustrates specifically that this isn't a -- a formal matter that it's not a question of just writing into the law, this shall apply to the state properties, it's -- it's a matter of real importance to -- to these municipalities who are in the business of making this type of commercial lease and the State -- it's not just a matter of form to write a statute in a particular way, it's a matter of real economics as to whether they do want to have equality of taxes between lessees from the State and from the municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.915" offset="14807019">Texas attempts to meet this claim of discrimination on -- with three replies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.260" offset="14836381">First, it claims, or at least the School District claims, that the exemption is lost, the state exemption was lost in the case the property has leased the commercial -- for commercial uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.058" offset="14915584">And I think that this is true technically at least with respect to properties of charitable institutions which are exempt for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.164" offset="14952051">I think if they go into business, or lease the people who are in business, they do lose their exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.708" offset="14978173">But this specifically is not true with respect to towns, municipalities and states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.463" offset="15009207">Their exemption continues as long as they have not abandoned the ultimate use of this property for a governmental purpose and as long as they are using the current rentals for governmental -- for -- for state or municipal purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.154" offset="15075976">Under these circumstances, the exemption continues even though they are renting for commercial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.595" offset="15113801">And as I -- I mentioned a minute ago, this type of commercial lease is specifically recognized by the -- by the statutes in Texas.</text>
