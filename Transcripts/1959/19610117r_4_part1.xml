            <text syncTime="24.859" offset="99370">In view of the extensive consideration that this case has already received at the last term, I will not burden the Court with any detail recital of its prior procedural history.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.459" offset="161750">Case is here on appeal from a final judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.903" offset="183589">The Court's opinion is found in the record at page 249 and the judgment it entered at page 270 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.486" offset="221936">That judgment affirmed the final judgment of the Superior Court of Bibb County, Georgia, which is found at page 101 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.737" offset="262896">The Superior Court found that Section 2, (eleventh) of the Railway Labor Act, that is the statute of 19 -- January, 1951, which authorized union shop agreements to be made or permitted union shop agreements to be made between railroad subject to that Act and labor unions subject to that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.614" offset="358400">The Superior Court found that section of the law to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.616" offset="382433">It therefore enjoined the enforcement of two union shop agreements on the rail -- on the Southern Railroad, each embracing some eleven, twelve different organizations, enjoined their enforcement permanently.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.782" offset="483056">Those agreements are identical in terminology except for reference to parties with the union shop agreement that was before this Court in Railway Employes' Department against Hanson, 351 U.S. 225 in which this Court unanimously sustained the validity of Section 2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act and upheld the validity of the agreements made pursuant to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.262" offset="613042">And which, as I say, was identical to the agreements here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.457" offset="641776">Now, I would like first to address myself in summary form to the facts that were developed in this very exhaustive and voluminous record.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.903" offset="695589">The evidence in the trial court shows, and these facts are stated a little more at length in our original brief at pages 11 to 15.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.620" offset="834456">The evidence in the case shows that these unions, who are defendants in the case, in addition, to their normal and predominant function on activities of negotiating rates of pay, rules, working conditions, collective bargaining agreements of various sorts, administering such agreements, policing them, handling grievances under them.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.507" offset="950021">In addition to that, they do engage in certain other activities through such institutions as the American Federation of Labor-CIO, the Railway Labor Executives Association, Railway Labor's Political League.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.279" offset="1021074">They engage in various legislative and political activities, educational activities, and some of the individual unions support from time, legislative representatives at both state and national levels, whose function is to promote or oppose legislation pending before Congress or the state legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.755" offset="1126922">Collectively, they participate in the publication of the newspaper labor which advocates various ideas and promotes various processes and publishes news selectively addressed to people interested in labor.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.067" offset="1292225">In those magazines, they publish news of interest to their membership and advocate various political and educational objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.914" offset="1351576">The funds that are used for these purposes, subscriptions to newspaper labor sometimes which were bought by the unions, derived from the general dues, initiation fees and -- of the unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.175" offset="1448647">Insofar as assessments are concerned, although the union shop agreement and Section 2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act, both refer to membership being conditioned only upon the payment of the uniform, fees, dues, and assessments, regularly required as a condition of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.827" offset="1543210">There is no evidence in this case that any assessments have ever been levied by any of these unions for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.353" offset="1601411">Further, there is no evidence in this case that anybody -- that anybody's thinking, anybody's expression has been, in any way, controlled or coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.095" offset="1676330">There's no evidence that anybody has been required to attend any meetings.</text>

            <text syncTime="425.006" offset="1699944">There's no evidence that anybody has been required to read anything or to listen to anything or to refrain in any way from expressing himself on any subject with complete freedom in writing or orally, or any place that he may want to express himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.999" offset="1787925">There's no evidence that anyone has been required to conform to any of that similar idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.062" offset="1820212">There's no evidence that anybody has been required to profess as his, the views expressed by the individual unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.309" offset="1873189">Further, there is no claim that any of the expenditures made by the unions for any of these purposes are ultra vires the Constitution and bylaws of the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="691.743" offset="2766890">Well, obvious -- obviously the fact that the Court set the case for reargument indicates that I was not wholly successful in persuading the Court to that effect last spring.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.286" offset="2813074">But I do want to discuss the extent to which the Hanson case is applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.589" offset="2842331">Now prior to the decision of the Hanson case, I argued in that case that union shop agreements notwithstanding Section 2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act are simply private agreements between private institutions, the railroad and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.800" offset="2903144">And that the Government is not involved in their execution, they have simply that permitted them.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.959" offset="2935745">The Court didn't agree with me on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.648" offset="2946508">And the Court held in the Hanson case that the union shop agreement has the imprimatur of federal law upon it, particularly because it overrides state law to the contrary, because the Section 2, Eleventh overrides state law to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.254" offset="3028950">Accordingly, we naturally must now proceed on the premise that the making of the union shop agreement and the requirement that dues and initiation fees be paid pursuant to such agreement involves governmental action upon which constitutional limitations must bear.</text>

            <text syncTime="813.196" offset="3252767">I think it's one of the vaguest terms that has entered this kind of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.164" offset="3280562">And that brings me to exactly the next point that I want to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.618" offset="3302400">It's assuming as we must that there is this concept of governmental action involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.827" offset="3343256">We set -- in appraising it, we certainly cannot assume that the compulsion is of the same character as a statutory mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.768" offset="3387037">The -- there is no law that says, you must belong to a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.880" offset="3411487">There is no law that says, you must belong to a union if you want to work for the railroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="1310.885" offset="5243507">It does not seem to me to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.510" offset="5253956">The unions remain private institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.736" offset="5266913">The Government didn't create unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.815" offset="5279242">These unions were in existence even long before there was a Railway Labor Act to protect them in certain respects against the employer interference and things of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.379" offset="5333473">The Government doesn't authorize them to spend the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.220" offset="5352803">To be sure, in certain respects such as the Corrupt Practices Act, the Government has limited the way they can spend their money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.431" offset="5389688">But so far as the basic authority to make expenditures is concerned, that derives from the constitution and bylaws which are controlled by the majority of the membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.746" offset="5434932">The Government isn't the one who says for what they may spend their money except just the Government has seen fit to limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.859" offset="5475370">So I would urge for your consideration that the mere expenditure of money, even though acquired as a result of the union shop agreement does not have the imprimatur of federal law upon it, and that the line should be drawn as between the making of the agreement which you've held to be valid, although subject to constitutional limitations, and the expenditures of funds which does not involved the --</text>

            <text syncTime="2064.746" offset="8258978">There was nothing in the record to indicate what the union does with the additional income it gets by reason of the union-shop.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="2072.489" offset="8289907">Well, it was simply addressed to the statements you were making to us at the time that there was nothing in this to prevent a member from supporting or failing to support or refusing to support somebody else.</text>

            <label>Mr. Milton Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="2085.304" offset="8341211">I think that nothing that the union said is understood as expressing the views of every single member of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.320" offset="8381231">Now, this view was stated very clearly by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in the case that has to be argued immediately after this one, and I wouldn't take up your time by quoting them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.970" offset="8419788">We did quote it last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.065" offset="8428251">I think the view is expressed most clearly by the Supreme Court of California in the celebrated DeMille case in which -- which was very similar to this one in which this Court denied certiorari some three or four years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.307" offset="8485198">But in DeMille case, the Supreme Court of California said with respect to the contention that the expenditure of money to espouse a view with which the individual disagreed was compelling him to espouse that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.843" offset="8543295">They said similarly to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, "Payment by the plaintiff of the assessment would not stamp his act as a personal endorsement of the declared view of the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.782" offset="8591047">Majority rule necessarily prevailed in all constitutional government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.517" offset="8610064">Else payment of a tax levied for a duly authorized and proper objective could be avoided by the mere assertion of beliefs and sentiments opposed to the accomplishment thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.178" offset="8660637">In a government based on democratic principles, the benefit as perceived by the majority prevails."</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.252" offset="8688953">Now, I think that is the approach here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.377" offset="8697417">This is just like in the case following this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.566" offset="8710165">Nobody is compelled to say anything and the fact that an organization to which he is compelled to belong says something does not mean that he is saying it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.964" offset="8755827">I submit that what the -- what the appellees are arguing here in substance is that it is unconstitutional for unions to do what I think most of this Court has indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.242" offset="8808908">They not only made properly do but have a constitutional right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.721" offset="8830851">And I'm referring to the CIO and UAW cases, that is United States against CIO in 135 -- 335 U.S., and United States against United Automobile Workers in 352 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.159" offset="8896575">The majority of the union has constitutional rights too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.678" offset="8910681">They have the right to speak and they have the right to speak collectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.892" offset="8931474">In the first of those cases, four justices of this Court would have held it unconstitutional to prohibit a union from printing matters in their union publications that did not pertain to collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.695" offset="9002736">In that case it was --</text>

            <text syncTime="2251.229" offset="9004826">Did those four members base that on a record which showed that the union -- and the raised a question that whether a union could constitutionally talk of using funds that it had gotten from people who compelled to join the union, even though they didn't want to?</text>

            <text syncTime="2270.677" offset="9082671">But I submit with respect to that Mr. Justice Black, that there are other inducements than the union shop to get people -- to persuade people to join the union, for example, it is thoroughly established --</text>

            <text syncTime="2285.957" offset="9143798">Oh, you have the same kind of trouble, yes, with respect to a different aspect of the same law like Section 2, Eleventh.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.416" offset="9165636">For example, the union is the exclusive bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.704" offset="9182772">A man cannot make -- he cannot settle the terms of his employment, the union does it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.220" offset="9204820">I submit it maybe just as much of an inducement to join the union, to have a direct voice in determining what wage policies and hours policies and other conditions -- other objectives should be sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.375" offset="9249437">That's quite an inducement to join the union too, because you're -- you want to get in on the exclusive collective bargaining representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.641" offset="9278485">And yet, there appears to be no question --</text>

            <text syncTime="2322.606" offset="9290397">Do you present here to say so?</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.814" offset="9295203">I am using Mr. Justice Frankfurter's statement on that abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.083" offset="9312235">I think that is abstract in this case, going this case raises the question to whether when a man has to join the union to get a job, and he has to join because the Federal Government has passed the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.355" offset="9373362">Whether they can take the money that he has to pay in for dues and use it to support candidacies he is against?</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.771" offset="9407007">It's not a question that you put.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.208" offset="9412754">Of course, there are many inducements to join unions, which most of us realize and appreciate and most of us perhaps believe they are good, but that's not the question here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2364.009" offset="9456013">No, that -- that is not the question, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.781" offset="9463118">Just indicating there are other inducements which are perhaps too many people, more persuasive than the union thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.575" offset="9498227">Those two cases did indicate that the activities under attack, that is espousing political objectives in the union publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.111" offset="9528424">In the other case, the UAW case, it was buying TV time to espouse the virtues of a political candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.544" offset="9562175">That the unions were engaging in activities they had a constitutional right to engage in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.109" offset="9588402">The appellees must be saying here that it is unconstitutional, as to them, for the unions to engage in activities they have a constitutional right to engage in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.341" offset="9649319">I suggest also that if these expenditures violate the First Amendment rights of the appellees, then many heretofore unquestioned activities of the government would also violate the First Amendment rights of various groups of taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.519" offset="9713998">Now, I made this point in our brief last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.177" offset="9724656">I made it in oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.286" offset="9733120">Neither the Solicitor General nor the appellees have seen fit to try to answer it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2442.074" offset="9768229">The coercive power of taxation certainly is at least as great as the union shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.387" offset="9797486">In the case of the union shop, the sanction is losing a particular job with the Southern Railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.366" offset="9817443">In the case of taxation, you have to pay taxes wherever you earn money, and if you don't earn it, if you get it some place else, so long as it is income, or if you buy certain items, you pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.418" offset="9853597">In some jurisdictions if you buy food, you have to pay taxes.</text>
