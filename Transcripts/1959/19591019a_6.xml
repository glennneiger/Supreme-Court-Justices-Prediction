            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 6, Daniel J. Sentillies versus Inter-Caribbean Shipping Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.933" offset="195062">Mr. Kelner, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Milton Kelner</label>
            <text syncTime="25.616" offset="205824">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.092" offset="223692">I represent the plaintiff in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.501" offset="237380">The seaman was injured abroad ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.881" offset="250859">After a verdict before jury and the District Court under the Jones Act, the verdict was affirmed on post trial motions by the United States District Court Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.125" offset="307911">On appeal by the defendant, this verdict was reversed by the Fifth Circuit Court by a 2-to-1 decision and opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.314" offset="356603">There is a dissenting opinion written by that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.161" offset="372067">The issue presented to that Court and presented to this Court is, did the plaintiff present at the trial sufficient evidence that his fall aboard ship contributed to activate or aggravate this pre-existing dormant tuberculosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.591" offset="457749">The facts basically were these.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.763" offset="470392">This man was aboard ship as an engineer, the weather was rough, and the emergency arose whereby he had to attend to refrigeration engine in the forward portion of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.993" offset="519293">Safety lines had not been strong on his way back after having taken care of the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.824" offset="550640">The vessel suddenly fell away from under him, the -- the 20-foot wave at vessel is toasting at a 15 to 20 degree angle.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.085" offset="591705">When he fell, he fell on his left side injuring his side, his hip, his head, his shoulder, his leg.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.722" offset="634232">A wave swept over him, washing him at distance of approximately 24 feet, and unfortunately, his legs were spreadly -- was caught on the chain at the edge of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.907" offset="687000">In the process, he inhaled water.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.275" offset="704449">Before this accident, he had felt well and knew nothing whatsoever about any chest difficulties, chest complaints or tuberculosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.157" offset="751992">Immediately after this accident, he felt badly, he had a cough, a heavy cold, he felt as tough he had the flu.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.952" offset="791176">The ship was tree days out of port, the Port of Miami, and in those three days, the capital of the vessel treated him with pills, penicillin, treated him for this heavy cough, heavy cold.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.318" offset="840600">When he hit the Port of Miami, he thought all he had was a cold from being washed by the water and the blow to the side which restricted his breathing and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.367" offset="876857">And he went up to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.753" offset="882395">He was at the Hotel New York and couldn't shake the colds and went to see the hotel doctor up there.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.773" offset="906428">The doctor examined him so that he had a flu at level in his lungs and said that he needed hospitalization immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.140" offset="935894">The plaintiff returned to his home in New Orleans, went to see his family doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.002" offset="963375">Now, his family doctor had examined him regularly, no less than five or six times in the year before the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.959" offset="991169">X-rays of this man's chest take him as recently as too much before he fell, had fail to disclose any tuberculosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.690" offset="1026173">On re-examination of this X-rays, however, there was found to be a small infiltration, a small healed tubercular lesion that was missed on the initial examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.977" offset="1083329">Now, it is to be noticed that in this factual situation, the healed tubercular lesion, small one, was on the left side and the left lung.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.144" offset="1127946">This man found, received those (Inaudible) on the left side, left side of his lung.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.166" offset="1148008">The tuberculosis, when it developed, full-blown tuberculosis was in his left lung.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.948" offset="1175176">The medical testimony was that a blow to the chest can caused an inactive tuberculosis to become active full-blown and progress rapidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.259" offset="1228361">Now, what test then is to be applied to determine whether or not the blow to the chest plus this other factual background that I've given to you, aggravated or activated his preexisting dormant tuberculosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.905" offset="1302967">The cases are uniform, and there is no question as to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.122" offset="1319894">The test is that probability is the chest, namely, did the blow to the chest probably aggravate his preexisting condition?</text>
            <text syncTime="314.657" offset="1362004">Now, there are three possible test that might be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.703" offset="1378200">We might use the test of absolute certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.166" offset="1391992">The plaintiff is not required and no plaintiff has ever been required to prove any such thing with absolute certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.665" offset="1421981">The test might be possibility and possibility is not a sufficient test, so the test is probability.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.505" offset="1449357">Now, then, what proof do we have that meets this test of probability?</text>
            <text syncTime="341.798" offset="1470568">We have two doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.356" offset="1480808">One of which, eminently, well-qualified tuberculosis specialist who stated, he was one of the treating positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.188" offset="1508080">He stated, and we've quoted his testimony in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.895" offset="1526993">He stated that this blow in his opinion probably aggravated the preexisting condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.012" offset="1559385">Another doctor stated not -- not less than three times, and we've quoted that in our reply brief, that the blow probably aggravated his preexisting condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.769" offset="1610480">Now, I suggest that the proof presented to the trial court meets the test of probability and that the jury was entitled to -- to believe the proof.</text>

            <label>Mr. Milton Kelner</label>
            <text syncTime="390.029" offset="1663457">The only issue that was presented to the Fifth Circuit was the issue of medical causation, it was -- this was the sole issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.569" offset="1693654">I suggest that this opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court is self-contradictory and is a most unusual opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.380" offset="1724897">I suggest that the Fifth Circuit Court ignored the testimony of both these two doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.961" offset="1751228">And I suggest that this Fifth Circuit opinion require the plaintiff to prove, not probability but certainty, because in reading the opinion, you'll see that the Court said, “Dr. Jacobs did not eliminate all other causes, but we are not required to do that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="429.502" offset="1821341">Now, I suggest that this opinion says the test is probability.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.015" offset="1851434">In the opinion, it says, “Dr. Jacobs testified probability.”</text>
            <text syncTime="440.501" offset="1865331">Yet, we say that that does not meet the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.920" offset="1891035">Now, there is one other matter that should be mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.070" offset="1903679">The plaintiff, when he felt, sustained certain admitted injuries even a part from his tuberculosis, namely, the headache that he had for a while that a blow to the chest, the scrape marks, the bruises that he had, the injuries to the leg, to the hip.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.155" offset="1963969">How can the Fifth Circuit Court disregard the admitted proof of positive injuries?</text>
            <text syncTime="471.904" offset="1991032">In the defendant's brief, they don't even bother to try to meet this because it can not be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.249" offset="2024364">They -- the Fifth Circuit Court, by this opinion, has, in effect, attempted to reevaluate the evidence and supplant its evaluation of the evidence for that of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.628" offset="2073893">And I suggest to that appellate courts have enough to do without reevaluating and acting as a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.058" offset="2111613">If I have not proven probability by four statements in the record by doctor stating probability, then how many times must I get it into the record that we have probability?</text>
            <text syncTime="517.187" offset="2172113">I suggest that the plaintiff -- now, there -- I should mention that at the trial level, this matter from beginning to end was bitterly contested right down to the wire on every witness on practically every question.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.030" offset="2231463">And it is true that the jury could have reached the same result that the Fifth Circuit reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.672" offset="2254033">But fortunately, for the plaintiff, it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.236" offset="2268348">On appeal, the plaintiff is entitled to all of the favorable testimony and inferences in its favor, and counsel for the defendant cannot state that any of the facts I've stated are not supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.237" offset="2332296">Now, the Fifth Circuit, in its opinion, has failed to follow even its own opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.952" offset="2367195">Under the -- the test under the Jones Act, for example, as they have stated it in the Liberty Mutual Company case, 171 F.2d 723, is the same that I have enunciated, namely, a question whether the disability was approximately caused or materially contributed to by his accidental injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.756" offset="2446399">Now, in that case, as in this case, the witnesses' statements on cross-examination are somewhat inconsistent but said the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.350" offset="2480776">In the Liberty Mutual case, the witnesses' inconsistent statements present a question for jury, it is the function of the jury to reconcile or believe or disbelieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.421" offset="2529050">The opinion itself, hence the most unusual, the opinion itself, Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals opinion cites the case of Chicago Great Western Railway Company versus Smith, 228 F.2d 180.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.352" offset="2584743">If you read the opinion, you'll see that we have the same basic problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.746" offset="2598327">The doctor on direct examination stated his opinion that the acts, and it caused the plaintiff's injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.053" offset="2615568">So on cross-examination, the doctor said, “The injury could have been caused by the accident or lifting,” and he could not tell which had precipitated the plaintiff's injuries, nevertheless, said the Eight Circuit in that case but again re-affirm by the Fifth Circuit by citing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.308" offset="2680560">That was sufficient to support the jury's verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.616" offset="2693831">Now, under the Ferguson case, decided by this Court, 352 U.S. 521, the test under the Jones Act whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that the employer's negligence played any part even the slightest in producing the injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.400" offset="2768959">We respectfully submit that we have more than met this proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.329" offset="2788707">We respectfully submit that the Circuit Court of Appeals has denied this man by its verdict, has deny this man his right to a trial by jury, has taken away his jury verdict, has attempt to the act as a jury, has usurp the functions of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.828" offset="2850670">We ask that the verdict to reinstate it.</text>

            <text syncTime="698.677" offset="2898108">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.806" offset="2918588">I am most strikingly impressed by the admission of my adversary that there is no issue here as to negligence that the only issue here is involving a factual situation, and that his complaint is that an appellate court sat in reevaluation of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.977" offset="3027257">And I think it's obvious that the only reason we are here today is because the petitioner now seeks to have this Court sit a reevaluation of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.402" offset="3073024">The very thing he decries has having occurred in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.310" offset="3100609">I would like to make these comments about the -- the argument of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.972" offset="3127254">I think the Court will find several factual inconsistencies in that argument by reference to the record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.872" offset="3178872">This gentleman was about 40 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.672" offset="3190053">He was hired by the Inter-Caribbean Shipping Corporation as a general manager and the overseer of the company operations in conjunction with the management of a banana boat running from Florida and from the Gulf Coast down into Central and South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.868" offset="3270823">Mr. Sentilles was and is a refrigeration engineer, he is not a seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.316" offset="3296632">Mr. Sentilles, on this occasion, as the manager of the vessel, signed himself on and placed himself on the ship as a member of the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.285" offset="3344488">This, of course, was done without any opportunity for the company to have a physical examination of the man or to go through the ordinary and customary pre-sign on investigations and examinations that often occur when seaman first go to sea for a shipping company.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.259" offset="3424423">Mr. Sentilles is being in charged of the vessel, in charged the operations' bypass such a procedure with himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.239" offset="3464338">Now, after this accident, it became apparent for the first time through the histories that he gave to positions both prior practice and in the hospital that he had a most remarkable history, remarkable in that it was right down the line consistent with a slowly developing progressive tubercular condition in the very area that he seeks to him liability upon this defendant for.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.320" offset="3596622">It is shown by the record that for a period of at least six to eight months, Mr. Sentilles had persistent nights which -- persistent at a recurring colds that he was unable to shake off, a deep and persistent hoarseness, a general tired feeling which the doctors refer to his malice and most significantly for some eight years prior Mr. Sentilles had been a -- a confirmed diabetic.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.643" offset="3725981">And I might a diabetic whose condition was not adequately kept under control by Mr. Sentilles and the words and then the testimony of his family doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.638" offset="3773942">And I think that the Court will find also in a reference to the record that upon retrospect and upon examination by qualified tubercular man, the X-ray's in 1950 and in 1952, before this alleged incident in 1953, showed a developing progressing tubercular condition in the lung.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.667" offset="3865997">Now, it's true that the family position, an admitted general practitioner without much experience and diagnostic procedures for tuberculosis did not read these films in 1950 and 1952 as reflecting tuberculosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.122" offset="3935901">But it is highly significant that the experts and the merchant marine hospitals in New Orleans, the tuberculosis men, the chest men when they saw these films and examined the X-rays in conjunction with the man's history and statement and with the entire record before them, found an enlargement and a constantly progressive development being reflected in these films.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.726" offset="4034226">It is highly significant also that one of the own -- one of the plaintiffs and the petitioners own witnesses, and I might interject here that the defendant and respondent was at the trial and still is content to rest its case on this issue with the plaintiff's own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.959" offset="4107160">There is no medical testimony was adduced at the trial by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.221" offset="4124296">So that everything before Your Honors today was brought and injected into the record by the plaintiff-petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.191" offset="4156165">But it is highly significant that one of the doctors stated that he himself TB man had made an extensive survey and had found that diabetics such as Mr. Sentilles or in his own words inordinately susceptible to tuberculosis, perhaps, five times as great as a non-diabetic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.169" offset="4248012">And so, we now go into the medical evidence to see just what was developed by the plaintiff at this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.132" offset="4283852">We say that the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit most aptly and correctly characterizes this testimony for if there was ever a case where a failure existed, with reference to prove, we believe this is it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1687.051" offset="6851584">And yet, when we present him with our post trial motions, he did not agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.394" offset="6868929">But upon appeal, the record had been tried to -- prepared, it was not available for the trial judge at the time we had our post trial motions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1708.213" offset="6936221">And it's our feeling that this case -- as a case on the books, certainly, is not inconsistent with any prior decisions of this Court, it doesn't circumvent any established policy of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.997" offset="6987316">We can see no reason why the matter should be reversed on the law on the facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1746.792" offset="7090552">I have only one comment to make, Mr. Beckham, and I tried this case in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.339" offset="7112704">His argument today is the same summation he gave to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.747" offset="7126392">It was a very final event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.944" offset="7131199">It's a -- very final now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.027" offset="7135483">But I still think it's a question for the jury to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.001" offset="7163382">The question was raised as to the judge's dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.167" offset="7179995">You'll notice that in my briefs, I did not mention the judge's dissenting opinion because I could find no case to sustain that dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.106" offset="7219806">In fairness to this Court, I should mention that I checked this carefully as I could for limit of my limited ability and found no case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.654" offset="7250004">Did this dissenting opinion present a very interesting problem?</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.436" offset="7269125">Is this question so different from every other question that we require special rules?</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.477" offset="7289292">Or is this a matter of proof like any other item of proof?</text>
