            <label>Mr. Paul R. Conaghan</label>
            <text syncTime="13.838" offset="158699">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.805" offset="190568">At the time for adjournment yesterday afternoon, Mr. Justice Black was discussing with Mr. Jackson the case of Sanitary District versus United States in 266 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.894" offset="282937">I proposed first to present an analysis of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.724" offset="330271">This was an -- unanimous opinion by Mr. Justice Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.157" offset="360051">The Illinois statutes permitted a diversion from Lake Michigan of 600,000 cubic feet per minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.956" offset="411146">The Secretary of War by permit allowed a diversion from Lake Michigan of 250,000 cubic feet per minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.580" offset="453674">The Sanitary District, 1913, asked the Secretary of War to divert from Lake Michigan 10,000 cubic feet per second, considerably more than 250,000 cubit feet per minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.540" offset="517517">The Sanitary District -- this application for a permit was denied but the district persisted in diverting more water than permitted by the Secretary of War.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.255" offset="580420">And then the United States brought the suit in equity to restrain the State of Illinois and its subdivision, the Sanitary District from taking more than 250,000 cubic feet per minute from Lake Michigan and diverting it to the Des Plaines River and Illinois River to the Mississippi River basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.697" offset="702151">Now, the Sanitary District in that case denied the right of the United States to determine the amount of water that should flow through the channel to the Mississippi basin and also deny the right of the Secretary of War to determine the manner of the flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.377" offset="804864">Mr. Justice Holmes stated in his opinion at page 426 that the evidence is sufficient that evidence is necessary to show that the withdrawal of water on a scale directed by the statutes of Illinois threatens and will affect the level of the Lakes, and that is a matter which cannot be done without the consent of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.501" offset="941328">Now, Mr. Justice Holmes proceeded to "The first and third clauses of Section 10 of the 1899 statutes," which I would refer to as Section 403, U.S. Code annotated, 33 Volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.284" offset="1036518">The Court then stated at page 429 as now applied, it concerns a change in condition of the lakes and the Chicago River admitted to be navigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.763" offset="1098376">Now clearly, in making that statement, Mr. Justice Holmes was referring to the third clause of Section 10 or Section 403.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.934" offset="1155114">But then he continued --</text>

            <text syncTime="443.273" offset="1876511">On the same point, because the Wisconsin and other Great Lake states joining in that case complained to the Court that the State of Illinois and the Sanitary District was not complying with the provisions of the permit issued by the Secretary of War, and that as a result, the level of the Great Lakes was going down.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.259" offset="2012453">And they -- they complained about this because it was -- so they claimed ruining commerce and destroying the shores and materially affecting navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.475" offset="2085282">There is some language in the Sanitary District case which I would like to refer to that also is one page 429.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.414" offset="2157066">Mr. Justice Holmes says, “If that be necessary and obstruction to their navigable capacity,” referring to the lakes of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.674" offset="2202102">Now, the word obstruction is not within the third clause of Section 10 which I have just read, condition is there and he -- as anything affecting the condition of a lake or navigable river.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.048" offset="2267512">Obstruction appears in the first clause of Section 10 and I shall I read it.</text>

            <text syncTime="570.462" offset="2385272">Now, the reference to obstruction by Mr. Justice Holmes in the Sanitary District case, really was surplusage because that first clause must be construed with Section 9 which is now Section 401 in the code.</text>

            <text syncTime="1920.301" offset="7784573">While we're on the subject of the Sanitary District case, I'd like to call attention to the language of the Court on pages 428 and 429.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.931" offset="7835146">Justice Home was -- Holmes was explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.081" offset="7851656">In the first part, he quoted in regard to Section 10 not only the subsequent clauses referred to by counsel with just argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.924" offset="7899094">But he started out by the first -- first clause involving the creation of any obstruction, not affirmatively authorized by Congress is hereby prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.081" offset="7947682">He includes that as the language that he is considering in Section 10 as well as the later part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.069" offset="7975685">Then he says by Section 12, violation of the law is made a misdemeanor and punished and the removal of prohibited structures maybe enforced by injunction of the proper court of the United States in a suit under the direction of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.497" offset="8037334">So he's talking about the same Section 10 and the same provision about structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.344" offset="8064711">This statute repeatedly has been held to be constitutional, and then he goes on to say, there's a broad expression of policy in unmistakable terms advancing upon an earlier Act of 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.989" offset="8111313">And then he says it forbad obstruction to navigable capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.149" offset="8132002">Then he goes on to say, as now applied, it concerns a change in the condition of the lakes and the Chicago River admitted to be navigable -- navigable, and if that be necessary an obstruction to their navigable capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.344" offset="8184769">Then the Court proceeded in accordance with that under Section 10 and Section 12 to grant the injunction as grave.</text>

            <text syncTime="2029.428" offset="8221132">As I understand Mr. Conaghan, his argument is that while there was a practical factual obstruction to the withdrawal of water, that was incident to works to physical obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.619" offset="8285811">And therefore, to the physical obstructions clearly would intend -- it could have been incident to abating that nuisance, if I may use that terms, also prohibits the withdrawal of water.</text>

            <text syncTime="2100.268" offset="8504404">Now, in the Wisconsin against the Illinois, in the opinion by Chief Justice Taft, the Court deals with the Sanitary opinion and says, “The true intent of the act of Congress was that unreasonable obstructions to navigation and navigable capacity were to be prohibited.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.018" offset="8579427">And in the cases described in the second and third clause of Section 10, the Secretary of War acting on the recommendations of the Chief of Engineers was authorized to determine what in the particular cases constituted an unreasonable obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.050" offset="8639613">So it first says that obstructions that were unreasonable were absolutely prohibited unless they got Congress' consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.030" offset="8675453">And then if they were not unreasonable, they could get the permit that would authorize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.723" offset="8706278">Now, that is the proper construction of those cases and the Government's willing to rely on those two cases of this Court as to how they have applied and interpreted this Act -- these sections of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2177.955" offset="8815156">Now, they say it's not economic to take anymore of this material out of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.626" offset="8833860">And I think probably isn't economic because there isn't any question what they could precipitate or settle more by additional settling basins but it's a question of what the cost would be of doing that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.623" offset="8897912">Now, then you have to weigh it against the question of dredging and it's cheaper to dredge than to build additional settling basins to take it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.993" offset="8939395">In the first place as we set out in the appendix here in 1899, the Secretary -- of the Corps of Engineers went to the Illinois Steel Company involved in the same problem, although Illinois Steel has dredged over a great many years as the Government asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.751" offset="9002402">But back in 1899, the question was brought up and the Corps of Engineers asked that they put in settling basins because they were throwing even more material into this channel and obstructing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.262" offset="9052453">Now, of course it's -- it's a lot cheaper if you don't have to dredge either like they're saying here today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2260.707" offset="9146180">Well, I don't think there's any question but what it can -- because portable water is recognized by the people in municipal water field as having 30 to 50 particles of several solids in it per million parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.220" offset="9216293">Now, this is at least four times or more than now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.484" offset="9237295">So in order to get portable water, all your municipal systems have to do better than this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.204" offset="9264149">It's just a question of the economics of whether they want to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.760" offset="9278464">And if they can get out dredging and get out of doing it, they unload the whole cost on the citizens in taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.611" offset="9309811">And it's the position of the Government just as -- as the Committee said that it's unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.877" offset="9330918">They get the full benefit of this navigation and the tremendous sum of the United States pays to provide navigable channels and waters for this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="2392.880" offset="9674898">And therefore, they wanted a provision, felt that it wasn't covered oil.</text>

            <text syncTime="2425.796" offset="9806555">You see it was built so that it -- with it Sag channel, it would run away from the lake when originally it ran to the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.565" offset="9845635">And therefore, even sometimes when there is a lot of flood water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.527" offset="9865488">It still runs into the lake despite the engineering that they have made of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.414" offset="9885027">But in normal times it moves very slowly and that's one of the problems of settlable solids because by definition, that's whatever it will settle within a period of two minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.732" offset="9938317">But in a fast moving stream, for instance, like the Hudson or something like that, it would wash on down and get out of the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.172" offset="9968097">Although even there, there is -- there had been some problems that are -- are -- the Congress has had to deal with because the vessels that the City of New York would use in other people dealing with sanitation problems, they take them in all scows that couldn't hold the material and it would all drop out in the harbor before they got out to a great enough depth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.810" offset="10054614">And the Congress has acted in separate section in regard to that.</text>
