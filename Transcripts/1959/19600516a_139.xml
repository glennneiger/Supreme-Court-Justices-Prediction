            <text syncTime="34.738" offset="242291">This case is here from the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.749" offset="258382">The question is whether the petitioner -- the question is whether the petitioner was lawfully held ineligible for suspension of deportation because he refused on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination to testify in the suspension proceeding whether he was or ever had been a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.407" offset="385024">The petitioner is a Korean.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.576" offset="397667">In 1928, he was admitted to the United States on a student's visa and he went to school in college here and received bachelor's and master's degrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.958" offset="455241">By 1937, he was ready to return to Korea and rejoin his wife and child.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.282" offset="488469">In that year, however, war broke out between Japan and China.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.354" offset="524831">Petitioner was unwilling to return to Korea, which, of course, at that time, was part of the Japanese empire, because he thought that if he'd return to Korea, he is a technician, would be put to work for the Japanese war machine.</text>

            <text syncTime="127.590" offset="613752">He was ready to go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.589" offset="621693">But if he went back, it would have meant that he would -- would have been helping the Japanese war effort against China and he was anti-Japanese.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.091" offset="663698">So he continued in school for another year up until July 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.697" offset="694209">And after July 1938, he stopped attending school and took full-time employment in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.088" offset="731721">And in July 1938, the same reason that it induced him not to go back to Korea in 1937 still existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.531" offset="765471">In 1938, he didn't want to go back because of the Japanese-Chinese War, so he continued on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.349" offset="804760">Now, that made him deportable because he had overstayed his student's visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.096" offset="831718">So, deportation proceedings were instituted against him and this culminated in an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.836" offset="886680">And this order found him deportable for overstaying his status as a student.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.140" offset="915937">It also granted him the privilege of voluntary departure and this he did on a finding by a hearing officer and which was an essential finding for granting the privilege that he had been a person of good moral character for the preceding five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.232" offset="992319">But by this time, we were at war with Japan and departure was impossible, so the petitioner stayed on (Inaudible), and he worked in defense industry as a chemist.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.199" offset="1168175">As I was about to say, the Government hired him.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.840" offset="1182699">He stayed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.598" offset="1185729">First, he worked in defense industry as a chemist.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.506" offset="1197432">And as a matter of fact, the FBI cleared him to work on a secret government contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.062" offset="1227630">And in July of 1945, the Office of Strategic Services recruited him as a volunteer for a projected hazardous mission.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.136" offset="1271933">He was recruited by the OSS, a group of men, Koreans who are to be trained to be dropped as American spies in Japanese occupied Korea.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.254" offset="1332433">He was trained for this mission, but just as his group was scheduled to depart overseas, Japan surrendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.956" offset="1371199">So he never did go overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.366" offset="1384887">Everything was conspiring to keep him here.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.606" offset="1397844">So in September of 1945, he left the Office of Strategic Services and he returned to private employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="339.939" offset="1463150">He was now anxious to return to Korea because the war was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.690" offset="1482167">Japan had been defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.708" offset="1490213">And he wanted to get back to his native country.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.601" offset="1505782">But although the war was over, exit permits were still required.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.614" offset="1525844">And they were required until late 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.492" offset="1541308">So he, on several occasions, applied to the State Department to get an exit permit and he never received a reply and never got the permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.046" offset="1583522">As a result, he was still here in the United States on July 1, 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.508" offset="1617377">On that date, Congress liberalized the statutory provisions for suspension of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.573" offset="1657710">Among other things, the Act of July 1, 1948 dropped the racial restrictions which previously had excluded Koreans, among other nationalities, from any possible consideration for suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.136" offset="1727927">So that as a result of the July 1, 1948 amendment, for the first time, he had a chance for suspension of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.152" offset="1772022">And in June of 1950, the Immigration Service, on its own volition, ordered the deportation proceedings reopened so as to allow him to apply for suspension of deportation under the liberalized legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.369" offset="1852897">Now, by this time, the petitioner didn't want to return to Korea.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.506" offset="1877347">The Syngman Rhee Regime was then in power in Korea.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.287" offset="1896469">The petitioner had become the editor of a Korean language newspaper in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.912" offset="1931055">This newspaper was an anti-Rhee paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.012" offset="1947460">And the petitioner was afraid that if he went back to Korea, he would incur physical persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.523" offset="1977448">So he didn't want to go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.727" offset="1986330">And now, that the suspension possibility, for the first time, became available and the Immigration Service reopened it so as to permit him to apply for suspension, he took advantage of the opportunity and he did apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.731" offset="2254346">Now, the suspension statute, under which he applied and which is the statute which is applicable here, was first enacted by the Alien Registration Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.109" offset="2311816">And this added Sections 19 (c) and 19 (d) to the Basic Immigration Act of 1917 and Section 19 (c) was amended by this liberalizing legislation that I referred to of July 1, 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.111" offset="2399796">Now, Section 19 (c), as amended, prescribed certain conditions before a deportable alien is eligible for suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.632" offset="2449951">If and when these conditions are met, the Attorney General then has discretionary power to grant or deny suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.073" offset="2499688">If the conditions are not met, the Attorney General does not have discretion to grant suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.798" offset="2530513">So far as the petitioner here was concerned, the relevant conditions of eligibility under Section 19 (c) where that they have resided in the United States for seven years, that he have resided here on July 1, 1948 and that he proved that he proved that he had been a person of good moral character for the five years preceding his application.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.427" offset="2649109">But in addition, Section (c) says that except as provided in section (d) or subsection (b) and section (d) or subsection (d), Section 19 (d) says that the suspension provisions of 19 (c) are not applicable to aliens who are deportable under certain specified statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.372" offset="2764884">And among these various specified statutes was the anarchist deportation statute of 1918.Now, after the petitioner filed his application for suspension, but before it was enacted upon, this anarchist deportation statute of 1918 was amended by the Internal Security Act, the McCarran Act of September 23, 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.065" offset="2891630">And the McCarran Act amended the anarchist deportation statute so as to require the deportation, not only of aliens who were -- who were or had been anarchists, but also of aliens who were or had ever been members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.340" offset="2972714">Now, the effect of this, so far as this case is concerned, is that it automatically enlarged the scope of Section 19 (d) so as to withhold from suspension the suspension provisions of 19 (c), persons who are deportable on account of Communist Party membership.</text>

            <text syncTime="784.098" offset="3239790">Now, hearings were held in 1950 and 1951 to determine whether the petitioner should be granted suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.270" offset="3280436">And there's no question but that the petitioner met the resident's requirements of Section 19 (c) for eligibility for suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.641" offset="3325889">An evidence was introduced at the hearing bearing on the requirements of eligibility that the applicant proved good moral character for the five years proceeding the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.469" offset="3389210">And the evidence on this subject included good character affidavits from persons who were well acquainted with the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.606" offset="3425782">It included the petitioner's own testimony about his history.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.483" offset="3445321">It included a letter from the Office of Strategic Services which praised him for his service with the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.496" offset="3481370">It also included a report of a field investigation by the Immigration Service and a report by the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.195" offset="3520136">These reports disclosed that petitioner had no criminal record and that no derogatory information about him have been discovered at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.369" offset="3564857">And the fact is that the record contains no evidence of any kind which adversely reflects on petitioner's character.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.764" offset="3606444">All the evidence is to the effect that he is and was a person of good moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.698" offset="3634134">But during the hearing, the examining officer, he was the equivalent of a prosecutor, as distinguished from the hearing office, during the hearing, the examining officer asked the petitioner if he was a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.742" offset="3706337">Now, it has not suggested that this question was asked because the service had any information that petitioner was in fact a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.340" offset="3752730">The question was asked out of the blue as it were.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.461" offset="3773210">Now, when petitioner was asked this question, “Are you a member of the Communist Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="923.844" offset="3798706">His attorney objected on the ground that the question violated the First Amendment and the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.374" offset="3836844">And on the advice of counsel and on those grounds, the petitioner refused to answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.504" offset="3869341">When the hearing was resumed at a later date, the examining officer asked the petitioner, toward the end of the hearing, if he then wanted to answer the question, “Are you a member of the Communist Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="957.354" offset="3932766">If petitioner said, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="959.050" offset="3939558">He would decline to answer again.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.814" offset="3954604">This time, he just mentioned his privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.347" offset="3968711">He didn't say anything -- he didn't incorporate the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.346" offset="3988773">Then, the examining officer asked him whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.511" offset="4017403">And on the advice of his counsel at his deportation hearing, the petitioner again -- the petitioner refused to answer the question as to the past on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.849" offset="4082813">Now, the hearing officer denied suspension of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.463" offset="4105174">And from there, an appeal was taken to the Adjudications Division of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.964" offset="4127222">That was then no longer, but at that time, they had this intermediate administrative appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.521" offset="4153448">And the Adjudications Division denied suspension, then the appeal went to the Board of Immigration Appeals and the Board of Immigration Appeals denied suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.823" offset="4194617">Then, the petitioner brought an injunction suit in the District Court in Los Angeles to review the deportation order and the order denying suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.048" offset="4239548">And the District Court sustained the denial of suspension and the Court of Appeals affirmed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.919" offset="4263058">So there have been five different levels of decision here, three administrative levels and two judicial levels.</text>
