            <text syncTime="38.886" offset="258905">This is a case in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.902" offset="274996">It arose out of an occurrence in October 26, 1956, where two men were drowned in the Detroit Harbor Basin, who were alleged as crewmen of a yacht known as Sis, while returning from their shore leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.039" offset="367574">Each men left a wife and three children, and the only persons present at the scene of this occurrence were members of the crew or members who were employees of the owner of the yacht.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.471" offset="465272">In an effort to get information, the plaintiff in this case filed a motion for to -- for discovery depositions as to one of the parties and two or three of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.736" offset="558268">The lower court granted said motion and I must point out that there was a local admiralty rule in this Court and the respondent then took -- sought a mandamus and prohibition writ in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit to prevent the taking of said depositions, oral and pretrial for discovery purposes only and Judge Lynn Parkinson wrote a -- an opinion, holding that the writ of prohibition and mandamus should issue, which was issued, preventing the taking of the oral discovery depositions and further held that the local Admiralty Rule for this District, Rule 32 was void in that it exceeded the power of the local court.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.351" offset="840808">This Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.135" offset="851884">I -- I might point out one other thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.795" offset="866513">This is an admiralty because of a limitation action.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.624" offset="885844">Previous to the limitation action being filed, a Jones Act suit was filed by one of the deceased -- decedent's representatives and the -- then the limitation action was filed and an injunction was issued preventing the proceeding under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.374" offset="976854">So that the question we have is whether or not, oral pretrial discovery depositions are permissible in an admiralty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.148" offset="1039966">The question is only -- is one of procedure but it affects the whole of the admiralty bar because it would -- if the Court so holds in accordance with the Seventh Circuit, it will mean that it's going to change the practice and procedure of the admiralty lawyers throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.004" offset="1159398">I say this because the following district courts in the following states have similar admiralty rule -- local Admiralty Rules pertaining to depositions, pretrial depositions, as similar to the one we have in our State, New York, Pennsylvania --</text>

            <text syncTime="1945.110" offset="7883839">De bene esse also applies to taking evidence for trial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.617" offset="7921873">In the Carpenter versus Winn case, this Court held that trial does not include the pretrial matters or matters preliminary to trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1971.895" offset="7990941">If we were trying to take a deposition rule for evidence, Rule 46 and the de bene esse statute would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.660" offset="8021974">However, where we take a pretrial oral discovery deposition, which is not used as evidence but is a matter preliminary to trial, we are in no way talking about a trial or we are talking about evidence for a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.685" offset="8082160">What we are talking about is a discovery procedure which does not affect any substantive right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.106" offset="8111835">And as long as it doesn't affect any substantive right, then we know that we do not need a special statute or a special power and the Court then has the right to take it under Rule 44 in 2071 and 2073.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.510" offset="8189367">Now, of all the cases that have been decided, we have categorized them into four branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.590" offset="8221759">The first, the cases decided prior to there being the local rule are where a local rule was not taken into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.766" offset="8262405">In those cases, counsel cites three cases; one the Mulligan case, two the Mercado case and three the Kelleher case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.751" offset="8310366">Now, on the Kelleher case which was in 1950 and after the others, the judge who wrote the decision in that case denying the right for an oral deposition became the judge who wrote -- headed the committee for Rule 46 which is now their local rule and which is followed to this day in the practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.846" offset="8402735">All these have been Southern District New York cases that counsel has cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.876" offset="8430843">In the second category, decisions basing the right to take the pretrial oral discovery depositions because of Admiralty Rule 32 (c), we cite the Brown versus Isthmian, the Bunge, the Ballantrae, and the Galperin cases which appear in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.335" offset="8540662">In this case -- in this situation, the judges took the attitude that Section 32 (c) written as it was has sufficient basis to infer the right to take oral pretrial depositions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3723.109" offset="14995832">I point out that it has been explicitly decided by this Court that it isn't a good idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.046" offset="15027597">This Court may at anytime change its mind, but it hasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.870" offset="15050898">If it changes its mind, it will change it, one assumes, in the way appointed by Congress for the exercise of its legislative function rather than as part of the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.017" offset="15107427">This Court having already, in an earlier case cited in my briefs, rejected a suggestion coming from none other than the Attorney General of the United States in an opinion by the Chief Justice that a rule which the Attorney General regarded as nationalistic in admiralty law, the -- rejected in favor of the civil practice in the exercise of the judicial function, and the reply being that is not the judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.865" offset="15230830">The judicial function is to know the law, to find the law, to enforce the law, but the legislative function is to make the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.542" offset="15273566">And when this Court acts under the legislative function that Congress has committed to it in the manner that Congress has prescribed, that's one thing but not in the exercise of a particular case, not to change the rules in the middle of the game, if that isn't the dirty word when discovering, discussing discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.725" offset="15382235">It's inconceivable that counsel should make such a distinction as he undertakes to make, I say it's inconceivable, I retract and apologize.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.411" offset="15424972">Counsel has undertaken to make a distinction between taking depositions on the one hand and the use of depositions on the other and he has undertaken it under the Mercado case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.863" offset="15478784">What the Mercado case held was based on some hard law according to what His Honor, Judge Clark, called the ordinary ground rules of judicial decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.015" offset="15543463">And that law was -- that the existing rules of this Court and the existing statutes to which the de bene esse were inconsistent with what was attempted to be done in deposition discovery practice in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.836" offset="15642728">Now in that case to be sure, they had used the depositions below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.301" offset="15684524">And that is something that is covered by the de bene esse act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.955" offset="15715244">But equally and in the first section of the de bene esse act, the taking of depositions is covered, covered by a carefully considered elaborate quote which says “Just when you can take depositions,” that statute applying in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.244" offset="15808345">You can take some them when a witness resides more than a thousand, a hundred miles in the place of trial, bound on the voyage to seas, he is bound out of the countries or something of that kind, in those circumstances you can take, but you take them high, you take them de bene esse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3957.394" offset="15932897">What does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.984" offset="15955257">De bene esse is defined by Bouvier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.860" offset="15974797">The examination of the witness de bene esse takes place where there is danger of losing the testimony of an important witness from death by reason of age or dangerous illness, or where he is the only witness to an important fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.052" offset="16043551">In such case if a witness be alive at the time of trial, his examination is not to be used, but you can't take it unless there's danger of losing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.572" offset="16109693">The examination in certain cases, the courts will allow evidence to be taken out of the regular course in order to prevent the evidence being lost by the death or the absence of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.159" offset="16167999">This is called taking evidence de bene esse.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.869" offset="16186807">Now it is the de bene esse acts that are preserved by Congress for admiralty and for admiralty alone, and to take the witnesses' testimony for any other purpose or under any other conditions and those that are prescribed by the statute of the United States -- is inconsistent with the statutes and since when could District Courts of the United States make rules that changed federal procedural statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.833" offset="16414699">My friend says that it isn't inconsistent because it doesn't affect a substantive right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.069" offset="16471646">I'm not prepared to engage in a semantic fencing match as to the meaning of the words, procedure or substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.877" offset="16534862">I prefer to go directly to the substance of the situation and that is that where you have a court say to a man, drop your ordinary affairs, go to a lawyers office, sit there as long as we think we want you too or have a use for you, but answer everything he asks you.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.908" offset="16662967">And so that lay not only with reference to framed issues but if he thinks he can maybe find out something that would equip.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.331" offset="16700688">When you do that to a man, you invade what from the time of Coats institutes has been known as common right.</text>

            <text syncTime="4363.372" offset="17556877">Coming directly to that which of course is the next obvious step in the discussion, counsel relies on what.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.658" offset="17590000">He relies on Rule 44.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.702" offset="17602226">What does Rule 44 say?</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.361" offset="17612779">Rule 44 says that in matters not provided for by these rules, that's number one, the District Courts can regulate their practice provided their regulations are not inconsistent with the rules of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.351" offset="17708805">Now first thing I wish to point out is that the two limitations, first, that the matter must be one not provided for by this Court's Admiralty Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.224" offset="17776306">But even in matters not provided for by this Court's Admiralty Rules, it is possible for a District Court to strike off in some directions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.017" offset="17807444">It would be inconsistence with the policy of the rules of this Court and therefore the second proviso is that there are two distinct limitations upon the rule making power of the District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.958" offset="17867212">That is Rule 44.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.987" offset="17875362">That is not a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4445.499" offset="17885393">That comes as a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.784" offset="17898559">That's a rule of this Court and certainly this Court did not undertake to exalt the power of District Courts beyond those powers which the Congress which created them had given.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.860" offset="17966791">And therefore, we must find behind that rule a statutory authority and that statutory authority is the statutory authority presumably that existed when Rule 44 was adopted which was before the current Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="4489.095" offset="18059786">Under a statutory situation which expressly, explicitly and in terms confided to this Court the power to prescribe the mode of taking discovery to the District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.221" offset="18148289">Indeed the intention of Congress by making that provision one of giving power to this Court was so clearly designed to create uniformity, national uniformity of practice in that regard, that it is conceded of all people even by Judge Fee and referred to by petitioners in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4541.858" offset="18270856">And when Congress passed the new Judicial Code, it said that this Court -- the constitutional court and the only one and all courts, the statutory courts could do what, for they could make rules for the regulation of their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4566.636" offset="18369912">But such rule shall not be inconsistent with rules of practice prescribed by the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.925" offset="18423097">This is no housekeeping rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4584.089" offset="18439711">This is a rule of vital importance as evidenced by the fact that under the statutory situation on which- - under which Rule 44 was adopted, the power to prescribe them to taking discovery was given to this Court, the only Court whose rules operate generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4606.650" offset="18529991">As evidence to gain by the fact that this Court has over the years, ever since 1844 specifically legislated as it had the power to do by these national rules with respect to the mode of taking discovery.</text>
