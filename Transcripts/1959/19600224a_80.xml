            <text syncTime="18.085" offset="175731">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.237" offset="192345">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Florida which so interpreted the Florida Sales and Use Tax Act as to require Scripto Incorporated, the appellant here, to act as a dealer and collect the use tax of that State on sales of its Adgif products, which is its advertising specialty line, to consumers in the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.506" offset="305403">Having so held, the Supreme Court of Florida, then held that the statute as thus construed and applied did not violate either the Commerce Clause or the Due Process Clause of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.081" offset="367679">Scripto Incorporated is a Georgia corporation which has its principal office and place of business in the City of Atlanta, where its manufacturing plant is located also.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.487" offset="417311">Scripto has not qualified to do business in the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.614" offset="433821">It has in the State of Florida, no office, warehouse, distributing room or other place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.390" offset="460884">It owns no property, no inventory, no stock of goods and no bank account in the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.462" offset="501217">Adgif Company is not a separate corporation, but is a division of Scripto Incorporated and Adgif likewise has its office in Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.656" offset="546043">Adgif devotes its activity to the sale and distribution of mechanical writing instruments with advertising material imprinted thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.469" offset="597243">There are no employees of Scripto and no activity of Scripto in the State of Florida which has any relation, whatever, to the distribution or sale of the Adgif line of merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.085" offset="655757">The sole activity in Florida which generates orders resulting in Adgif sales is the activity of independent commission brokers who represent not only the Adgif division of Scripto, but other manufacturers as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.560" offset="749589">That's right, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.380" offset="760874">Those advertising specialty brokers have a brief form of written contract with Adgif Company and that contract is -- is in the record in this case at page 19 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.981" offset="835271">By the terms of that contract, Adgif Company exercises no control whatever over these advertising specialty brokers.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.935" offset="867140">The contract merely provides for the rate of commission to be paid, the brokers, the conditions under which the commission is to be paid, is -- does not require that they devote any particular amount of their time to the solicitation of orders to Adgif sales or that they not represent others as well as Adgif.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.780" offset="950523">It provides expressly that the intention of the parties is that the broker shall not represent or hold himself out as a representative of Adgif Company, that he has no authority to make any collections or deliveries or to incur any debts for Adgif, that his sole authority is to solicit orders subject always to the right of Scripto, Adgif Company in Atlanta, to either accept or reject those orders when they are received.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.036" offset="1071522">The contract expressly states that no relationship of employer and employee is intended that the salesman is an independent contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.436" offset="1117080">When this advertising specialty broker receives an order and forwards -- forwards it to Adgif in Atlanta, if Adgif, in its discretion, sees fit to accept that order, the order is consummated by delivery of the merchandise to an interstate carrier in Atlanta and delivery is completed at that time, therefore, be Atlanta that has expressly provided in the order forms which is the next exhibit following that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.531" offset="1229511">That title shall pass in the City of Atlanta when property is delivered to the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.353" offset="1252812">Shipment is made directly to the customer in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.166" offset="1268067">The advertising specialty broker has nothing to do with any deliveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.718" offset="1286248">Payment for the merchandise is made directly to Adgif in Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.630" offset="1305893">The broker is not permitted and does not make collections.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.349" offset="1332746">Now, Scripto in addition to its Adgif sales, sells its regular line of merchandise through wholesalers throughout the country for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.706" offset="1386245">That is the line of merchandise which you see at the -- at the corner drugstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.681" offset="1410069">Now, those -- the distribution and sale of Scripto's regular lines which I would like to refer to it here, is completely separate and distinct from the distribution and sale of its Adgif line.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.504" offset="1461373">Scripto does employ one employee salesman who resides in the City of Jacksonville, Florida and whose sole authority and function is to solicit orders and promote business by these wholesale jobbers for the regular Scripto line.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.784" offset="1526471">It is a stipulated fact in this case that Adgif sales do not arise by reason of any activity of this employee salesman and that those sales arise solely by reason of the solicitation activity of the independent brokers who solicit the Adgif orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.399" offset="1616959">That is a -- a stipulated fact and I might mention that there are no disputed facts actually in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.178" offset="1672129">I -- I think not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.906" offset="1682996">I think that -- and the Supreme Court of Florida in deciding that Scripto was a co-dealer, within the meaning of Section 212.06 (g) of the Florida statute, said that, “It is so only because of this solicitation activity of these independent brokers and not by reason of this completely unrelated and unconnected activity of the Scripto employee salesman.”</text>
            <text syncTime="425.665" offset="1805981">It is our position that -- that amounts to a construction of the Florida statute to that effect by the Supreme Court of that State and that it is binding on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.394" offset="1852897">And that the only question before this Court is whether a state may constitutionally require an interstate seller who has no place of business, no employees within a state, whose interstate sales arise solely by reason of solicitation activity of independent brokers who represents other sellers as well, whether such a state under those circumstances may constitutionally require this out-of-state seller to act a tax collector for the use tax arising out of those sales to Florida consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.741" offset="2014333">It is appellant's further contentions that this statute as construed and applied in this case, imposes a direct burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.003" offset="2079431">Now, we concede that it is a use tax which we're dealing with here, rather than a sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.256" offset="2112345">In other words, that the incidence of the -- of the tax imposition is on the Florida residents who uses or consumes the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.296" offset="2156544">We concede that the State of Florida has the constitutional right to tax used by its citizens of tangible personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.042" offset="2187577">This Court has long ago decided that, but what we challenge is the direct imposition upon Scripto of the duty of acting as a tax collector and we submit that from the Florida statute, it is abundantly clear that this is a burden which is imposed for the privilege of engaging in business in the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.996" offset="2291336">And I would like to direct the Court's attention in that connection to Section 212.12 of the statute -- on page 29 of the statute which is in the appendix of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.694" offset="2358105">The pages of the appendix are separately numbered from the brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="575.469" offset="2405230">I mean, you say -- you said a minute ago that this makes Scripto a tax collector for -- well, does it merely -- is it merely using Scripto as an agency for collecting or does it has paid us out of its own pocket?</text>

            <text syncTime="896.728" offset="3690245">That -- that the states here -- that this State is by this construction of its statute regulating and impeding interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.940" offset="3735176">Even if the Court, however, should consider that this is not a direct imposition on interstate commerce, we would like to point out that the burden imposed by this from tax collection duty here is unreasonable and that it bares no relationship whatever to any privilege or benefit derived by Scripto from the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.390" offset="3840920">There is no need for relationship whatever to any need of the State of Florida to collect its taxes in this manner and that the imposition on the appellant, Scripto, is beyond all proportion to any benefit derived by the State of Florida from collecting its taxes in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.570" offset="3933602">This Court has recognized that there must be some local incident, some local activity however minute, from which the obligation which the State seeks to impose arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.846" offset="3998804">And as a result of which the out-of-state corporation derives some benefit from the State before that State has the power to burden the interstate transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.700" offset="4062124">For example, in General Trading Company and in the International Shoe Case, this Court found that solicitation of orders by employee salesman even though a very minimum connection with the State imposing the obligation, was nevertheless, a sufficient nexus or connection to permit the State to impose an obligation arising directly out of that specific activity which the Court clearly pointed out in the International Shoe Case or as the basis for that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.113" offset="4203813">But here, there is no activity of Scripto in the State of Florida in relation to its Adgif sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.488" offset="4233279">It is not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.082" offset="4239653">The only activity there in relation to those sales is the activity of independent brokers who are themselves, Florida business, who are themselves protected by and derived benefit from the laws of the State of Florida and who maybe and presumably, are required to discharge certain obligations in return for those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.862" offset="4326797">I would like to point out that this statute expressly conflicts that a broker who represents an out-of-state merchant who refuses to register and collect this tax, is himself made the dealer and required to collect the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.475" offset="4389282">Therefore, the State of Florida here under the terms of its own statute has a means of collecting this tax from the 10 independent advertising specialty brokers who solicit the Adgif orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.637" offset="4437870">They are by the terms of the statute, required to register as dealers and collect the tax and Scripto does not do so, so far has not lost anything by the interstate -- by reason of the interstate immunity of Scripto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.782" offset="4510490">I would also like to point out that the danger and in fact the existence of possibility of discrimination against interstate commerce is inherent in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.581" offset="4589693">The various section of the Florida act which defines the term dealer and which was the definition which the Florida court held to apply here, which appears -- appears at page 15 of the appendix to our brief, “At the defining dealer to mean and include every person who solicits business by representatives or by the distribution of catalogs or other advertising matter and by a reason thereof, receives and accept orders from consumers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.093" offset="4711737">And this -- as it goes on to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.449" offset="4717171">“And such dealers shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter from the purchaser and no action either in law or in equity on a sale or transaction as provided by the terms of this chapter maybe held in the State by any such dealer, unless it would be affirmatively shown that the provisions of this chapter had been fully complied with.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.143" offset="4799927">And that is the only class of dealer against whom the Florida statute imposes this penalty of denial of access to the Florida courts, is the dealer defined in that section which is obviously out-of-state dealers, because it as a dealer who gets business by reason of solicitation of orders by representatives, catalogs and so forth.</text>
