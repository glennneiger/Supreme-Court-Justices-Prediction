            <text syncTime="1386.673" offset="5650056">Everyone's approaching this as the registrars are performing a state function, in accordance with their state policy, as they understand it and has it has been explained to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.312" offset="5688613">The statute itself sets up a subjective test whereby a witness is -- is asked about what any section from the Federal or State Constitution means.</text>

            <text syncTime="1411.730" offset="5750262">And the registrar is told how to handle misspellings and applications, and how they should not help Negroes fill applications up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.975" offset="5783280">That's told to them not by stray individuals, but by the Chairman and the counsel of a joint legislative committee, which was set up for that purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1891.428" offset="7669112">This means that the crime has been completed in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.523" offset="7681442">I need not remind you that proceedings before a grand jury are secret and no affiant need fair reprisals, if he can establish his innocence for the satisfaction of such grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1910.363" offset="7744867">On receiving that letter, the Commission reaffirmed its policy of maintaining secrecy as to its complaints until the actual holding of the executive session.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.139" offset="7787917">And that is the fear of such retaliation against these complainants in advance to the hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1996.683" offset="8090102">Pardon me, I -- I apologize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.662" offset="8098043">Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Court, I -- I want to say that we have two cases for argument today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.298" offset="8136600">One is No. 549, the appellees are all registrars or voters of State of Louisiana, that the Attorney General represents in federal matters, by virtue of an act of the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.888" offset="8198875">The other case is six individuals who were subpoenaed by compulsory process to attend this proposed hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.033" offset="8231476">There is no connection between either one of these particular cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.326" offset="8252688">I wanted to make that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.256" offset="8260420">Although the suits were filed simultaneous, because of necessity, they're completely independent of each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.299" offset="8288528">They were consolidated for argument before the three-judge court for our convenience and ordered consolidated for argument here for convenience of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.377" offset="8324890">And I wanted to make that particular observation, because there are certain defenses both in equity and law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.685" offset="8354147">And certain constitutional defenses that the registrars or voters claimed they're entirely different from those of the individuals who are in the other lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.771" offset="8410467">I want to say this, at the outset that we have no quarrel whatsoever, with the Commission's right to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.610" offset="8445785">We have no quarrel whatsoever, with their right to determine facts or patterns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.731" offset="8470340">What we do have quarrel with is the fact that when an administrative agency or fact-finding body, or whatever you call it, turns out to be an accusatory body, that the persons who are under compulsion and who are subpoenaed to testify, have the traditional safeguards which the Sixth Amendment and the Constitution gives to them, and the other amendments give to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.231" offset="8580263">And that Congress, itself, when it created the Commission on Civil Rights, had no authority to waive those safeguards, unless it was expressly stated in the particular Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.237" offset="8628328">Now, that is the position that the registrars or voters states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.672" offset="8650062">And I say that regardless of how idealistic and how wonderful the motives of the Commission maybe, and how fast they have to act to determine these particular rights, that that is no excuse to disregard the right of cross-examination, apprisal, confrontation and the traditional safeguards that are so inherent in our justice and in our system of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.960" offset="8759254">And that is why this particular suit was filed and the temporary restraining order was sought in the Western District of the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.968" offset="8799274">And it was because of the absence of those traditional safeguards and the harm that would come to the reputation of these registrars which is something that is basic in our democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.803" offset="8850578">Because of that irreparable damage that the Western District gave us a temporary restraining order and placed this case before a three-judge court on the issue of constitutionality, of the creation of the Commission itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.641" offset="8909928">And let me say herein now, that the order or the judgment of the Western District of Louisiana did not stop the Commission from operating in any respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.582" offset="8961651">It only said that you cannot subpoena these registrars and force them to testify until you give them the right of cross-examination, apprisal, confrontation, and the traditional safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.018" offset="9023404">All of the other witnesses that the Commission had it in Shreveport could have been heard and we would've had no objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.994" offset="9055378">In fact, they could have conducted their hearing even with those registrars, if they had complied with the court order and given them the right of cross-examination and the other rights that I'm referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.809" offset="9118595">And in this particular argument, I'll refer to them as the traditional safeguards for -- in order to conserve time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2294.064" offset="9279613">Louisiana law says that records of a registrar or voter can only be inspected by a registered voter of that particular parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.200" offset="9316185">They maybe copied upon the application of 25 registered voters of the particular parish or photograph and so forth, and failure to comply with that particular statute of Louisiana, results in a criminal penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2320.921" offset="9387029">We advised Mr. Tiffany of this particular conflict and we asked them that they meet with us in an error of agreement, but they chose to disabort -- they chose to avoid that and to go right ahead and hold their hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2341.317" offset="9468635">That Act was on the statute -- has been on statutes of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.543" offset="9481592">Its absence the Constitution of 1921 and has been passed on by our courts and our Supreme Court on several occasions, as being a law of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.451" offset="9525164">Now what -- what I want to come to are the facts in this particular case, because they are very, very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.417" offset="9557034">Every session of this Court that -- that it is held by the Supreme Court, you are called upon to pass upon these basic human rights, which is so dear to our democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.556" offset="9601546">And in each instance, you have gone carefully into the facts and the circumstances to determine whether those rights were violated or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.734" offset="9638327">Now, the facts in this particular case, I'm not going to go over them because they are contained in my affidavit which is found at page 142 of the record and the subsequent correspondence which is attached thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.282" offset="9692453">You will note that in January, Mr. Tiffany came to Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.941" offset="9711156">We had a very pleasant conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.887" offset="9718888">I advised him of every act of the State of Louisiana with reference to the registration of voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.032" offset="9743548">He told me that he saw no particular reason why we should have a disagreement and that they would investigate, and that they had particular complaints that charge these registrars with depriving certain individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.445" offset="9793181">And incidentally, I might say this, that I learned more about the proposed hearing that was scheduled to be in Shreveport today than I could ever find out from the Commission or any of its representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.364" offset="9844799">I wish that we have had that information in Shreveport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.634" offset="9857860">We may have been better able to have chartered our course and necessarily proceed with judicial dignity for an application for a restraining order but we never had that information much of that today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.767" offset="9914389">Today was the first time that we found out that Negroes were the only complainants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.813" offset="9930585">The -- the subpoena which was served upon these registrars says, that certain persons have been deprived of the right to register and vote by virtue of race, creed or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.356" offset="9972799">We didn't know whether they were white, black, yellow, red or green.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.307" offset="9988577">We didn't know that until today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.389" offset="9996936">And we don't know yet whether they were just on a right to register or whether it may have been for religious reasons or others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.363" offset="10024835">In other words, all of these information was kept away from us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.713" offset="10046255">As a result of our conferences, Mr. Tiffany told me that they would investigate all of these particular complaints and that after this inquiry, after this particular investigation, if they decided to hold a hearing, they would certainly do so.We both met that with our governor during the conference of the National Association of Attorney Generals at which I was host in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.917" offset="10139042">We met with our governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.941" offset="10147088">We decided then that it would be a good idea to have these interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.473" offset="10165269">Well, naturally, we thought that the interrogatories would be pertinent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2530.410" offset="10225037">And we received 315 interrogatories which reminds me of a government addition of a (Inaudible) catalog that has all kinds of questions in there that calls for opinions, that calls for matters entirely unrelated to the subject matter of such a fact-finding as the Commission chose to assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.792" offset="10314585">Many of those questions were certainly incriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.578" offset="10325661">It would have been dangerous to answer those particular interrogatories and then have that particular information at a hearing, because slander, incriminatory remarks and -- and other things could have crept into there, which would have violated these registrars' rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.610" offset="10389817">And besides, and I assure this Court that I was trying to cooperate to the best of my ability, and that I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.369" offset="10416880">And besides, the conditioned precedent for us -- on the receipt of the interrogatories was that they'd be absent in 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.915" offset="10451048">And number two, that after the receipt of the interrogatories, the Commission would hold a hearing anyway, if in his judgment, it decided to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.272" offset="10484485">Yet, counsel would have -- you believe that they were trying not to have a hearing and they want us to answer interrogatories what I say as -- I mean the registrars to answer interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.590" offset="10521684">And then if they decide the whole hearing, they will continue to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.285" offset="10536521">In other words, hold the hearing for what?</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.178" offset="10544044">Exposure purely for exposure's sake, because the Commission investigates these complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.701" offset="10570167">It determines what the facts and the patterns are and they have done exactly that in this particular case, because as a result of these complaints, they have determined the facts and have published to report, which says that I didn't cooperate, which is not so, which accuses Louisiana of bringing a road block, which is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.649" offset="10645922">And which even contains slander -- slanderous remarks about the lack of cooperation of Federal Judge Dawkins and the Western District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.568" offset="10677687">Of course, that's done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.078" offset="10683643">We can't do anything about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.144" offset="10691897">But that's an example of what we've been faced with in the handling of these particular facts, and then, in my negotiations with Mr. Tiffany, over whether to answer the interrogatories or not and all that's right in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.493" offset="10749367">He says, “Well if you have an objection so stated.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.072" offset="10759711">But then there was a release that came up from the Commission from Washington which said, that the Commission was going to hold a hearing in Louisiana anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.030" offset="10787506">So we just took the attitude, well, if you're going to have for hearing, come on let's have the hearing and get it over with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.982" offset="10807254">And as I said before, we had no objection to a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.237" offset="10820315">But a hearing how, according to rules of the Commission, rules which were not authorized by Congress, rules which were adopted in the form of a resolution, and in the midst of all these controversy, the Commission adopted a resolution in Atlanta as follows, “The Commission from his first meeting forward, having considered all complaints submitted to it as confidential, because such confidentiality is essential in carrying out the statutory duties of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.850" offset="10958764">The Staff Director is hereby instructed not to disclose the names of the complainants or other information contained in the complaints to anyone except the members of the Commission and members of the staff assigned to process study or investigate such complaints.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.400" offset="11012995">I defy anyone in this Courtroom to show me why Congress authorized such a resolution, or such a policy-making part on the part of the Commission, it is not in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.430" offset="11057089">The Act says that they will investigate right here, that they will investigate allegations in writing, under oath or affirmation, that certain citizens are being deprived of the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.931" offset="11111111">The Commission also adopted rules, the same ones that are in the Act, which we say are not sufficient and which Congress did not have the authority to do because it didn't go far enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.817" offset="11154683">In other words, Congress committed a “boo-boo.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.603" offset="11165759">Number 3, on page 3 of these rules, “In addition to the statutory of provisions, the Commission has adopted the following supplemented rules or procedure,” and then they go on with quite a few “which gives the Commission discretionary features, which gives them judicial finding features, which gives them adjudicatory features, which gives them the right to subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.292" offset="11256560">And we were talking a minute ago by the testimony in executive session.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.493" offset="11273383">You can only get one if the Commission decides to give you one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.228" offset="11284250">That's in the rules and only if you pay the cost of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.625" offset="11297834">There's no positive statement that the Commission has got to give you one, upon request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.621" offset="11317896">And then they come down and in G, they say, any witness desiring to read the prepared statement has got to submit more than 24 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.494" offset="11349347">And then they would decide after.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.024" offset="11355512">The Commission will decide, well, if they'll read or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.981" offset="11367320">Discretion again, policy again, which is not authorized by Congress, the Commission shall decide whether written statements or documents submitted to it shall be placed in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.210" offset="11404204">Again, the right to judge, we could've placed all kinds of written statements in there, 100.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.316" offset="11428655">And the Commission says well, no, we're not going to put that in there, because we alone reserve the right to determine the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.639" offset="11453942">They could take the testimony of one man as against 100 witnesses that we might present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.291" offset="11476511">Now, they might let us present them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.520" offset="11485497">And at the hearing in Shreveport, let me say that it was for one day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.853" offset="11498768">It was a public hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.074" offset="11507649">24 witnesses were subpoenaed by the United States Marshal, under compulsory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.363" offset="11528861">The ballots of the witness were subpoenaed by the Commission's own investigators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.549" offset="11549550">Again, a design of secrecy, again, a stark chamber proceeding, where we had no idea of the charges that we were going -- these registrars we're going to be faced with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.322" offset="11596675">We had no intention what it was about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.600" offset="11605765">We could prepare no defense, even under the rules of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.523" offset="11625514">So how could we, in all fairness, and with the traditional safeguards, that these registrars are entitled to, who are reputable people, most of them ladies, honest citizens of the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.677" offset="11674102">And the law has to assume that they are doing their duties, unless it be to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.721" offset="11694268">And with the benefit of that assumption, and with the benefit of the assumption of innocence until proven guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.442" offset="11717151">How could we defend these particular registrars in any sense of fairness or in any sense of justice?</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.519" offset="11745468">And yet, the Commission says that they want to develop the facts objectively, in order to make a report and to set a pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.139" offset="11771904">This record is replete, with cooperation on my part in the Board of Registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.102" offset="11791757">Where if any registrar was not doing his duty as prescribed under Louisiana statutes, we wanted to know about it, because we would fire them and we would prosecute them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.448" offset="11829164">The people that's on our brief of counsel here, of the District Attorneys to the various districts and these particular parishes, they're honest people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.043" offset="11863542">They wanted to find out the facts too, but every time we turned around, we were met with secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.059" offset="11887574">We were met that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.356" offset="11900844">Develop is a result of policy decisions of the Commission, which were not authorized by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.194" offset="11924146">And, of course, this Court has said many times that the denial of a right to cross-examination and to have these particular privileges, the act of Congress creating that administrative agency must to be expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.121" offset="11979839">That is in the Administrative Procedure Act, which we say governs the conduct and the affairs of this Commission, because Congress created the Administrative Procedure Act, healed it to eliminate overzealous administrators, such as the Commission here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.604" offset="12041801">Well, what the Commission wants to do, as a practical matter, is say come on down in Louisiana, we're going to be nice and good friends, but what's a little constitutional guarantees among friends?</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.196" offset="12084120">I can't hold that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.994" offset="12091329">I've got to protect the registrars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.632" offset="12097912">That's my duty as prescribed by my legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="3146.482" offset="12689324">And let me show you -- where is this stipulation here, which was filed between the Government and myself, as attorney for the registrars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.240" offset="12732374">On page 169, the Commission on Civil Rights received 67 written allegations prior to February the 27th under oath or affirmation, from certain citizens and so forth, and that they had been deprived of their right to vote because of color, race, religion, and national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.787" offset="12802487">And that these were received sometime prior to February 27th, a number of which alleged generally that the plaintiffs in suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.256" offset="12836446">And that -- that's the appellees here, the registrars through their acts and deeds had caused such deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.246" offset="12864345">Immediately, that makes them suspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.027" offset="12875525">That accuses them of violating the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.691" offset="12886183">And then the next allegation in this stipulation that after the Commission received these -- after the Commission on Civil Rights received these complaints, investigators of the Commission was sent to the State of Louisiana and investigated the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.109" offset="12951803">Now, that is admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.280" offset="12956505">There's no doubt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.112" offset="12963819">And those facts have to be kept in mind when you -- when you consider the rights that these registrars here assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.781" offset="12994539">And those facts, takes this case away from Groban and takes it away from Anonymous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.198" offset="13024214">Because in Groban, the -- the Court there was -- that is -- instead that that was a private hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.579" offset="13053680">This was to be a public hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.372" offset="13060890">In Groban, it was a private hearing which was authorized by an Ohio statute of some 30 years standing, which had declared it to be the public policy of the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.961" offset="13099238">And they were not suspects in Groban.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.528" offset="13109478">All the Fire Marshal was trying to do was to investigate causes of fires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.814" offset="13134660">But here, we have investigated the complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.969" offset="13151274">And they say that these complaints deprived these people of certain rights to register and it then -- it becomes accusatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.277" offset="13192443">And -- and I -- I'm not arguing with Groban, I have no -- I have no quarrel with Groban or Anonymous, but I just say that they are not applicable to the particular facts here, because here, they had conducted an investigation as in Groban.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.137" offset="13267884">And now, they were, by compulsory process, bringing these registrars to find out from them through their acts and deeds why they deprive these particular individuals of their right to vote which is a violation, as I said before, of federal and state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.213" offset="13336221">And in Anonymous, and -- and I might say that -- I might say here, that in Groban, this is a distinguishing feature of Groban in -- in my humble opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.987" offset="13375300">Mr. Justice Frankfurter and Mr. Justice Harlan said, “If Ohio legislature would directly, explicitly or by obvious design to have secret inquisition of those suspected of arson, we would have a wholly different situation from the one before us.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.978" offset="13427336">This is not a statute directed to the examination of suspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.862" offset="13442800">The aim of the statute is expeditious and expert ascertainment of the causes of fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.170" offset="13464012">And in Anonymous, there they were determining not attorneys, they were determining the activities of ambulance chases, under a statute or a policy of the State of New York and Mr. Justice Harlan wrote that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.107" offset="13523780">And, of course, they said, “That as a result of the authority of Groban, as a matter of fact, said Groban is controlling here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.597" offset="13553768">And the constitutional claims are far less terrible than in Groban, because the proceedings were conducted by an experienced judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.048" offset="13579577">In other words, Groban and Anonymous have no application here.</text>
