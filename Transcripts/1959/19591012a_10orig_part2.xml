            <label>Mr. James P. Hart</label>
            <text syncTime="55.057" offset="323584">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.294" offset="340511">In opening the argument for the Gulf States, I would like to state first our general position.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.667" offset="374053">We submit that the Submerged Lands Act transfers property rights to all of the Gulf Coast States to three leagues from their coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.320" offset="420655">The Government seeks to nullify what we contend is two thirds of that grant by implying a limitation to one league or three marine miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.730" offset="474258">We say that the grant in the Submerged Lands Act is not subject to such an implied limitation that the measure of a transfer in the Act is the State's historic boundaries as defined in that Act and that questions of foreign policy and international law are irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.929" offset="551058">In the alternative, we say that if international law particularly as interpreted by the United States in its foreign policy, at the relevant times, is to be considered that the boundaries of the States at the time they became members of the Union or as approved by Congress, were valid boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.426" offset="641128">With the permission of the Court, I would like to restrict my argument to our primary contention which is that the measure of the grant in the Submerged Lands Act is the historic boundaries of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.733" offset="694314">And that matters of foreign policy and international law by which the Government contends, a national boundary at three miles was fixed or beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.227" offset="748231">Mr. Dougherty and Attorney General Gremillion will argue the application of foreign policy and international law to the boundaries of the States in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.494" offset="797341">In presenting my argument that the Submerged Lands Act under which the States claim the rights that are involved in this case, measures the grant by the historic boundaries of the States as defined in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.365" offset="860871">I would first like to direct my argument to the terms of the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.171" offset="884067">The Act is copied a little more fully or portions of it on pages 333 and following, of the Government's main brief and I would like to refer to those sections as set out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.753" offset="946343">The Title II of the Act is copied on page 333 and the point I would like to make in that connection is that the title shows that it is an Act to confer property rights on the States in the submerged lands, that is beneath navigable waters, within state boundaries and it confirms the jurisdiction and control of the United States, seaward of state boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.003" offset="1059401">The granting clause in the Act is Section 3 which is copied on page 335 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.790" offset="1090539">That section begins by saying that Congress finds it to be and declares it to be in the public interest that title to an ownership of lands beneath navigable waters within the boundaries of the respective States and the national resources in such lands and waters are confirmed, transferred and established to the respective States.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.512" offset="1197432">The Court will note that the transfer is made on the basis of lands beneath navigable waters within the boundaries of the respective States.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.213" offset="1244244">And those terms are defined in Section 2 which is copied on page 334 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.468" offset="1277262">Lands beneath navigable waters are defined in that -- in subparagraph (2) of paragraph (a) of Section 2, to mean, “Lands covered by tidal waters extending seaward to a line three geographic miles distant from the coastline of each such State.”</text>
            <text syncTime="318.975" offset="1379244">I pause there to remark that the outer limit is a line three geographical miles primarily as stated in that Section and, and this is an additional grant, to another line.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.457" offset="1433161">“That is the boundary line of each such State where in any case, such boundary as it existed at the time the State became a member of the Union.”</text>
            <text syncTime="345.862" offset="1486869">And I might say the word is not as it was created or as that became, but as it existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.302" offset="1512573">“At the time the State became a member of the Union, or as heretofore approved by Congress, extends seaward or into the Gulf of Mexico beyond three geographical miles.”</text>
            <text syncTime="365.327" offset="1564714">The term “boundaries” is defined in paragraph (d) of Section 2 in three ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.421" offset="1593031">It says that boundaries mean the seaward boundaries, all the boundaries in the Gulf of Mexico or in the Great Lakes, first, as they existed at the time such State became a member of the Union, or second, as heretofore approved by Congress, or third, as extended or confirmed pursuant to Section 4 hereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.530" offset="1689475">Now, I'd like to pause there to say that I would like to discuss Section 4 on the moment, but at -- at this time, I want point out that the boundaries defined or -- or boundaries, historic boundaries that is, boundaries which are defined by historical facts as to what boundaries existed at the time the State became a member of the Union or as approved by Congress before the passage of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="470.692" offset="1986121">Is it your position that the legal effect of the Act of Admission to the Union is an immaterial circumstance in determining what the State's boundary was at the time of admission?</text>

            <label>Mr. James P. Hart</label>
            <text syncTime="489.817" offset="2062608">Yes, in the sense that it's argued by the Government that there was a shrinkage of the boundaries at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.496" offset="2093328">Unquestionably, when Texas became a member of the Union and the other States were admitted, there were changes in their legal relations.But the boundaries which had been fixed before the final Act of Admission and which continued in effect up to that time, also continued to be their boundaries as state boundaries.</text>

            <text syncTime="541.146" offset="2267930">(Voice overlap) but what are the boundaries of Texas today in the Gulf of Mexico?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_p_hart" startTime="544.183" stopTime="989.901">
            <label>Mr. James P. Hart</label>
            <text syncTime="544.183" offset="2280155">I think the boundaries of Texas today are three-leagues in the coast because that was the boundary that was fixed at the time we ended the Union and it has not been changed otherwise with the consent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.793" offset="2322578">And I think the consent of Congress would be necessary to change those boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.993" offset="2363329">I was speaking of the last -- I was getting to the last clause in Section -- subparagraph -- in paragraph (b) of Section 2 and I would like to mention that.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.268" offset="2404394">It says that, “In no event shall the term boundaries or the term lands beneath navigable waters be interpreted as extending from the coast line more than three geographical miles into the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean, or more than three marine leagues into the Gulf of Mexico.”</text>
            <text syncTime="595.250" offset="2484328">Now, the Government has argued in its brief and it -- it is correct in doing so that this clause was added as a clause of limitation on boundaries that extended more than three miles from the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.371" offset="2540857">But the significant point is, for these States, that the limitation in the case of the Gulf of Mexico was placed at three leagues from the coast whereas, it was placed three miles from the coast in the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.705" offset="2606164">The Court will note that the Gulf of Mexico is mentioned specially in both of these paragraphs that I've just referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.957" offset="2655169">It's mentioned at the end of subparagraph (b) in connection with boundaries that extend beyond three miles from the coast and in the last part of paragraph (2) that I've referred to, it is mentioned in connection with the boundaries which extend not more than three leagues into the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.988" offset="2739284">We submit being a recognition of a special situation, both historically and geographically, on the Gulf of Mexico which will be argued by counsel to follow me.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.714" offset="2778258">But the point is that Congress specifically said that the grant may extend as much as three leagues in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.688" offset="2814098">Now, I would like to refer to Section 4 of the Act which is copied on page 337 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.040" offset="2859551">That Section does three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.614" offset="2877837">In the first sentence, it confirms the boundary -- the seaward boundary of each original coasting State a three geographical miles from its coastline or in the case of the Great Lakes to the end of national boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.268" offset="2940426">And I would like to pose here to say that this is the only place in the Act that is in this Section that the national boundary is mentioned as the measure of the grant to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.007" offset="2987447">That is in connection with the international boundary which of course is the national boundary in the Great Lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.202" offset="3012211">Everywhere else in that, the measure is the state boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.071" offset="3031646">Now, the next two sentences of Section 4 relate to States who are admitted after the formation of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.300" offset="3064560">And it provides that those States are granted permission to extend their boundaries if they have not already done so, the three miles from the coast and that any act of the State by its laws or otherwise which showed an intent to so extend its boundaries, is confirmed by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.707" offset="3134151">Now, the last sentence is the one that is particularly applicable to the States involved in this case, because it deals with historic boundaries to use that shorthand phrase as boundaries are defined in Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.727" offset="3198307">And it is our position that this part of Section 4 and Section 2 should be construed together to see what Congress meant by -- in Section 2 by boundaries as they existed at the time each State became a member of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.891" offset="3270928">The last sentence in Section 4 says that nothing in this Section is to be construed as questioning or in any manner prejudicing the existence -- the existence of any State's seaward boundary beyond three geographical miles, if it was so provided by its constitution or laws prior to or at the time such State became a member of the Union or if it had been heretofore, approved by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.319" offset="3396629">Our point there, if the Court please, is that Congress had in mind when it said, “Existed at the time a State became a member of the Union,” numbers which had been provided and which were then in effect as provided by laws or the constitution of a State prior to the final Act of Admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.019" offset="3495476">We think that Congress must have had in mind the process of admission which is not a single final Act of Admission, but as a -- the history of this and other States shows, there's a process which includes several steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.480" offset="3569246">In the case of the four States who were territories before they were admitted to the Union, process of admission includes an Enabling Act which sets out the boundaries of the State and provides that a constitution, a state constitution shall befall.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.626" offset="3641866">The second step is the formation of a state constitution and these States provided in their constitutions for their boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.338" offset="3672691">And the third and last step is the Act of Admission, itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.628" offset="3689932">Now, Congress there used the words prior to or at the time of admission, because part of the -- the -- part of the legal acts which fixed these boundaries were acts which occurred before the final Act of Admission that is prior to the admission.</text>

            <text syncTime="1683.216" offset="6836224">But I would like to point out that as the counsel for each State will argue, the boundary which existed at the time of a State's admission to the Union or as approved by Congress, can be readily identified by reference to the Acts of Congress or to the laws or the constitutions of the States so that there is no difficulty in carrying out the effect of the Act, by referring to these legal documents which will be discussed at length by counsel for each of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.346" offset="6976763">The -- we submit, if the Court please, that these boundaries as set out in the State statutes or the Acts of Congress or the State constitutions and approved by Congress by its Acts of Admission either expressly or by a reference, are legal boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.077" offset="7083656">And they are the boundaries which are referred to and defined in the Act as the limit of the grant of property rights to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.025" offset="7123466">They are legal boundaries because they were provided by the competent legal authorities at the time before and at the time of admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.526" offset="7157426">And they had the effect of describing the perimeter of the State which was involved in that admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.355" offset="7216776">In determining further, these boundaries are legal boundaries as the Government argues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.250" offset="7252407">We submit that the Court should bear in mind if any test is to be applied, although then, simply that these boundaries were so described in these -- on the statutes and constitutions, the Court should bear in mind that this is a question, not -- the subject matter of this suit is not foreign relations, but is property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.098" offset="7351777">That is rights in the submerged lands and the natural resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.966" offset="7367241">And in the second place that the boundaries are state boundaries and that any test is to be applied as to their validity, then it should not be a test which -- which would be applied to a power, which in any event and anywhere, can be exercised only by the National Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.540" offset="7441533">In effect, what the Government is trying to say here, I submit, is that these state boundaries must be tested by what the National Government would do in applying its exclusive power over international relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.288" offset="7508511">We submit that that in any event, is not a proper test of the validity of a state boundary.And in that connection, I would like to mention the case that has been referred to here, the Skiriotes case, Skiriotes against Florida, 313 U.S. 69, where the question was the validity of a conviction in a Florida court, of a man who had taken sponges at two leagues from the Florida Gulf Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.029" offset="7651453">And the validity of that conviction was attacked on the ground that the Act occurred beyond the territorial limits of Florida and the statute said that these certain acts shall not be committed within the territories of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.735" offset="7718327">This Court in a unanimous opinion by Mr. -- by Chief Justice Hughes said that in -- “Under these circumstances where the defendant in the case was a citizen of the State and the question was the enforcement against him of a police regulation, that considerations of international law and the extent of the territorial waters of the United States were beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.734" offset="7838281">And all elements with regard to treaties or with regard to treaties or with regard to the limits of territorial waters of the United States, as they have been described by the Court in the Cunard Steamship Company versus Mellon and in diplomatic correspondence and statements of the political department of our Government is thus, beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.978" offset="7923336">We say, bearing in mind -- first of all, that these boundaries are valid boundaries which in the definition of this Act, because they are the boundaries which were prescribed by the statutes and constitutions of the States at the times that Congress designates in this Act, that that -- when that is found, that that's all that is necessary to make these boundaries, the lines to which these grants go in the submerged lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="2688.919" offset="10859081">One of them was opposed by Senator Anderson of New Mexico, who was one of the leading opponents of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.969" offset="10895235">And he said in -- I quote part of what he said here, the full quote is on page 25 of our joint brief.“My substitute does try to follow the three-mile limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.386" offset="10940897">Whereas, the Holland resolution does not do so, instead, the joint resolution sets a line as far as 10 and one-half miles off the shore.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.097" offset="10979767">His amendment was defeated and all similar amendments to tie the grant to foreign policy in the form of the three-mile limit were defeated showing and we submit that Congress deliberately chose to measure this grant not by questions of foreign policy, but by simply fixing lines which it thought were fair lines with the transfer of property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.154" offset="11072031">The President took part in the legislative process and we submit that his statements are therefore, relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.545" offset="11097527">He urged the passage of the Act to historic boundaries before the Act came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.679" offset="11122082">While the Act was being considered, about 20 Senators wrote him a letter asking him to state his position on the Act and stating that any grants beyond three miles would embarrass and obstruct the United States and its foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.633" offset="11193866">The President answered restating of what he had said in public speeches that he favored the grant to the States to their historic boundaries and by way of illustration of what he meant, referring to the submerged area extending to Texas submerged area extending three marine leagues seaward into the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.700" offset="11286131">He urged the passage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.293" offset="11300551">Surely, President Eisenhower was aware of the three-mile limit policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.137" offset="11323956">And if he had thought that the Act in anyway violated their policy, we believe that he would not have urged this passage when as he specifically said, he thought that the effect of the Act was at least as to one State to give rights out to three miles -- I mean, to three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.602" offset="11413817">The -- and we -- we think that it -- that what the Court says -- said in the case of Alabama against Texas, has some relevance particularly since that case was handed down less than a year after the passage of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.096" offset="11483721">The Act hasn't been passed in May of 1953 and the decision in Alabama against Texas being handed down in March of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.753" offset="11522382">While, certainly, the point was not decided, we submit that reading the opinions in the case, indicates clearly that it was assumed by all parties at that time that as to at least some of the Gulf States, they got rights out to three leagues in the Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.781" offset="11586539">In fact, in one of the opinions -- dissenting opinions, it stated that some States got about 10 miles indicating what the intent of Congress was if everybody understood it, at that time, closed to the passage of the Act about five and a half years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="2951.479" offset="11909308">We submit that it's clear that Congress did not mean that -- that foreign policy would be a limitation on the boundaries as to they're existing because it refers to the kind of boundaries that I've mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.640" offset="11965942">Now, we submit that -- that since the Act by its terms does not contain this limitation and since it was clearly not the intention of Congress that the grant should be limited by a foreign policy, that the States are granted rights out to three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.465" offset="12053191">We further submit that considerations of construction of statutes properly lead to the conclusion that this Act should be construed so as to give it full effect including the provisions in the Act for -- or relating -- referring to boundaries beyond the three miles and out to three leagues in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.536" offset="12161546">As I said before, the Government repeatedly conceives that the Congress had the power to make a grant to any line that it wanted to choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.596" offset="12225808">That that line could be all the way out to the edge of the Continental Shelf, if Congress had chosen to place it that far, that since this is a matter of a division of property rights in an area in which it is conceded, that the United States has exclusive jurisdiction and control according to the convention in the Continental Shelf that was adopted at Geneva that year, it -- it has sovereign rights by a reason of being the coast of the State adjacent to the Continental Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.943" offset="12367182">That -- that since that is the situation that whether the control which the United States has over these rights in the Continental Shelf is to be exercised by the National Government or by the States, is a matter of domestic distribution of powers which does not concern other nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.433" offset="12445132">So, we say that it is not necessary either for -- with regard to the purpose or the effect of the Act to -- to imply or to read into the Act a limitation upon the grant which is not found in the Act itself nor -- and which we submit, would be contrary to the intention of Congress as shown by the congressional debates.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.031" offset="12639483">As -- our position is this, that the term “boundaries” is a word that is used as a geographical expression which was well-known and in current use before this question of the limit of territorial waters arose for -- and that is pointed out by Mr. Dulles (ph) in his letter on page 343 of the Government's brief that the term “territorial waters” was not in use at the time Jefferson wrote his letter in 1793.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.096" offset="12791724">But obviously, the term “boundaries” was used because it was used for example in the Treaty of 1783, the Treaty of -- of Paris, which is copied on page 6 and 7 of our letter reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.696" offset="12842193">In other words, it states what the boundaries are and those boundaries include a boundary in the Atlantic Ocean which is determined by drawing lines 20 leagues into the ocean, due east, from the boundary of Florida and Nova Scotia and then wanting the line along the ocean to see what islands are included within that boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.265" offset="12924426">The question of the extent to which the -- the Nation will exercise the powers which go with territorial waters as that term has come to be recognized since that time, is a question of foreign policy which is -- which may vary from time to time and which does not necessarily depend on boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.171" offset="13016064">We submit that -- that boundary does not by any means -- is not by any means confined in its meaning to the limit of territorial waters which will be determined by considerations of foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.421" offset="13081057">Another example is the use of the word, “boundary” in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.</text>

            <text syncTime="3284.788" offset="13242493">Three leagues from land, it's not simply a call to go up to the beginning point, but that is the beginning point of the boundary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3366.441" offset="13569128">But that is a question of foreign policy which was decided as such and not necessarily with reference to any boundary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3404.389" offset="13720952">Another example was the boundary that was fixed of a session to Alaska by Russia in 1867, which fixed a western limit of that session out in the middle of the Bering Sea.</text>

            <text syncTime="3754.612" offset="15121847">Now, we have presented to the Court the opinions of Professor (Inaudible) of California and that we think the leading -- British sea law expert, Professor Columbus and we have an addition to that presented to the Court and this is on the general international law point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.916" offset="15187048">A tabulation beginning at page 199 of the Texas brief showing by opinions of publicists and diplomatic correspondents that throughout the period from 1763 to 1899, three leagues was mentioned as one of the approved limits or one of the possible limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.456" offset="15277223">We challenge directly, specifically, the contention of the United States that the United States has never at any time for 150 years as the Solicitor said this morning, departed from its present conception of the three-mile limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.741" offset="15358307">It seems to me sir, Your Honors, that the Solicitor General has -- is -- is trying to superimpose on the first half of the United -- of the 19th century conceptions as to the content of the territorial sea that were developed in the last half of the 19th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.027" offset="15439496">And that order -- in order properly to -- to evaluate this case and Congress directed the Court's attention to the state of international law and if you will, the state of foreign policy determinations of the United States if it be conceded arguendo that that is what's wanted to control this case, at the time that these States became members of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.034" offset="15535522">If they had intended present foreign policy to control, then if the answer was simple, but they said at the time that they entered, that determined a critical date and an earlier time in the progressive development of international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.478" offset="15601246">Now, may I call Your Honors' attention to the development then of this policy during the critical period from 1793 until 18 -- and 1868 when Florida's boundary was approved by Congress and direct your attention to that period regardless of what -- as later said about that period -- look -- let's look at the evidence as to the state of affairs during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.220" offset="15708244">Mr. Jefferson's letter which started this discussion is set forth on page 77 of the joint brief, the large green brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.411" offset="15757040">Now, he simply fixed provisionally in all premise, he simply fixed provisionally the area of the -- of adjacent waters in which the -- the infant republic would undertake to protect foreign shipping from belligerent acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.880" offset="15822869">He recognized in the course of that, that three leagues had some authority even then at that -- in its favor and it did, as a matter of fact, at that time because it had been suggested as the limit to the members of the Continental Congress who negotiated the peace treaty with Great Britain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.653" offset="15882010">Now, the next thing we did, we selected -- we -- we implemented his policy, but we also declared a fully custom zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.253" offset="15916387">Then, when we got up in the early part of the -- of the 19th century, the problem of impressment of seamen came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.820" offset="15946689">It was a critical thing ending up in the -- in the War of 1812 as you know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.704" offset="15966229">At that time, Mr. Jefferson who was President, just preceding the war, remembered his earlier reservation and said that the limits of the United States for protective purposes ought to be the gulf stream and he actually made such a -- a tender to Great Britain at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.381" offset="16032893">That would be as I understand it, some 50 or 70 miles off the coast of what was then the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3986.706" offset="16050239">Now, that was the foreign policy of the United States, the policy of broad limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.560" offset="16081586">At the time that Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama joined the Union, then Attorney General Gremillion is going to speak -- he will speak to you in a moment about the special physical characteristics of the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.436" offset="16141145">But I want to simply point out here that the Gulf of Mexico is a very shallow Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.210" offset="16168208">And the -- and it -- and it's physically not possible and this was recognized throughout the early part of the 19th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.800" offset="16198614">It was not physically possible for ships that sail the Atlantic and the Pacific to approach nearer than approximately three leagues in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.837" offset="16230693">So, the policy that was adopted in this area, which I will submit, is a reasonable policy based on that physical fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.650" offset="16269981">Now, what did the United States do?</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.774" offset="16278444">And here, I wanted to draw this parallel for Your Honors, during this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.896" offset="16298924">First, what did the United States actually do and what I think, what is the effect of the Government's contention?</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.339" offset="16324733">The United States did a series of acts during this period with specific respect to the Gulf of Mexico that it didn't do any place else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.246" offset="16356394">First of all, it admitted four States with Enabling Acts expressed in terms of leagues, three and six leagues in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.385" offset="16388890">The next thing that happened was that a -- an infant republic, Republic of Texas, declared a boundary, an all purpose boundary if you will, three leagues at sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.300" offset="16440613">There was no protest of this boundary on the part of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.352" offset="16456808">As a matter of fact, the United States proceeded to recognize that boundary and then, acquiesced in it for the entire life of that Republic and without protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.823" offset="16494634">And we will draw parallel in a moment that the minute a -- a statute was passed in Russia on the -- on the North Pacific, the United States was quick to protest.</text>

            <text syncTime="4255.146" offset="17123976">Down there, after -- with that boundary statute on the books, we fought a war.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.617" offset="17141844">The United States went to war to sustain a portion of that boundary and President Polk mentioned that Boundary Act in his warmest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.180" offset="17176116">The United States after the war instructed its peace commissioner to follow that Boundary Act in the peace negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.571" offset="17209657">And every draft from the Secretary of State furnished domestic trust, directed that that Boundary Act be followed and it was specifically referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.904" offset="17246960">We have the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo which it's admitted is still the international boundary of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.983" offset="17275277">You -- Your Honors have -- have seen the map that appears on page 1 -- 102 of the green brief, perhaps at page 102, where it clearly shows that as recent as 1912, the International Boundary Commission stated specifically the international boundary line begins three leagues at sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.340" offset="17356779">I don't understand that the Solicitor General disputes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.491" offset="17373288">Thereby, Treaties and International Act since that time, that boundary is the present boundary of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4325.429" offset="17405053">Now, the -- Mr. Tate in his testimony admitted each one of the facts that I have just stated to you that there was no objection to the boundary at the time and that for that reason, these Acts in the Gulf of Mexico are an exception to the general policy of the United States during this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.225" offset="17496273">And he also regarded the Florida Constitution also as an exception to the United States during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.550" offset="17525530">So, we have a series of Acts beginning with these gulf state boundaries occurring during this period that relate to the Gulf of Mexico at the same time for -- other things are going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.410" offset="17577044">Now, I see, the Solicitor General and here's on the other hand, the Solicitor General says that the -- I've given you the evidence for it as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.949" offset="17611212">Now, here's the evidence against it as -- what -- which the Solicitor General brings forward to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.984" offset="17635349">First of all, he adverts to a Treaty with Algiers in which we agreed with the day of Algiers that he would -- we -- he would protect our shipping under the guns of his corps.</text>
            <text syncTime="4392.401" offset="17672965">It seems to me, that's certainly within the Jefferson policy and at -- at least was more restricted, it was appropriate to the Mediterranean and that's fine, it doesn't prove anything about the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.993" offset="17715388">Next, he inversed to the Treaty with Great Britain in 1880, now, there's a wealth of diplomatic correspondence and one of the better respites that John Quincy Adams ever had, he had about that treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4414.620" offset="17761886">But the full effect of that renunciation has to be understood in the light of the fact that in 1883, we negotiated and got far on the Northeast Coast, the right to fish right up to the shores.</text>
            <text syncTime="4430.214" offset="17824266">And we -- we partitioned that right with Great Britain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4433.595" offset="17837746">After the War of 1812, Great Britain contended that the right had been terminated by the war and that we had no further right to fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.118" offset="17871809">The -- at the Treaty at -- at against, our commissioners refused to exit to that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.386" offset="17896887">Shortly thereafter, our -- our vessels were stopped 60 miles from shore and we -- and we've entered into negotiations to try to settle this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.182" offset="17940146">Frankly, what happened was a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.830" offset="17950699">We agreed to renounce the right to fish three miles, the narrowest limit we could get, off of the southern part of that coast, Coast to Prince Edward Island, in exchange for the right to fish right up to the shores on the Coast of Newfoundland and the coast of what is now Labrador, what is now Quebec.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.596" offset="18029798">If this thing had been a well settled principle of international law, you would have seen this written throughout this negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4488.641" offset="18057906">Instead, this is expressed in terms of a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.391" offset="18072952">And our negotiator says, what we gave up was the area where fisheries -- where the fisheries were not in favor of the fisheries we were interested in, the crab fisheries which were farther away from the shore than nine miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.897" offset="18130944">As late as 18 -- 1887, Francis Wharton of the State Department recognized that this was a policy limited to the Northeast Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="4517.591" offset="18173785">It was born and compromised, it was a fight that ended -- did not end until 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="4522.508" offset="18193429">Now, the next thing that the Solicitor General brings forward is the controversy over the Russian Ukase case of 1821, where Russia announced the claim to exclude fishing and exclude any contact with the natives from -- for 100 miles at sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.779" offset="18274513">Without detailing that correspondence, what John Quincy Adams simply told Russia was that 100 miles is too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.658" offset="18310040">That's -- that's an inadmissible claim, but he did not attempt to set a boundary at a reasonable distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.532" offset="18333550">He did not say the three leagues was an improper boundary, he negotiated for and got the right for American fishing to go up to the shore and use the shore, all the waters of the pacific except where there were settlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.773" offset="18394467">Now -- and he made a prompt protest to that boundary at that suggestion as soon as it came to his attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4581.104" offset="18427800">Now, the next one is the Falkland Islands controversy in 1832.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.022" offset="18451414">This correspondence can also be understood only by careful reading of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.521" offset="18477432">What it -- what actually -- the United States was -- was complaining about was the fact that there was no right of an exclusive fishery on a desert and uninhabited island.</text>
            <text syncTime="4608.880" offset="18538872">They had -- they said they had -- had been enjoined -- in enjoyment of the fisheries for 50 years and they used the shores, they used all parts of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.087" offset="18571682">And here, the Buenos Aires Government was excluding them without notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4621.554" offset="18589550">And they complained about this fishery, but what they -- they actually denied what is the concept of the territorial sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.028" offset="18627480">They actually said that the only purpose that any sovereign could have in limiting fishing close to the land was a revenue purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.462" offset="18661230">Now, that's not fixing boundary in the Gulf of Mexico, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.023" offset="18679515">Now, the only other things that I have discovered in the Attorney General -- I mean, in the Solicitor General's brief are two isolated statements dealing with the territoriality of ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.620" offset="18721834">Again, they are not fixing boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.487" offset="18733328">They didn't talk of sea limits in any of this discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.881" offset="18750882">This is -- I mean, talk of boundary, they talked in terms of sea limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.171" offset="18764048">And the jurisprudence of the United States at that time is inverted to in the Jefferson letter, near the end of it that the States were the competent ones to fix boundary, or Congress was confident to fix boundary, but Congress had a fixed boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.715" offset="18822248">Now, it seems to me that view -- viewing these two sides of the coin together, you've got a separate policy by the very action of the political departments of the United States, a separate policy for the Gulf of Mexico than what you have in their -- on these isolated instance is that each of these other isolated instances is being treated on an ad hoc basis specifically for that purpose without any intent on the part of the -- the Secretary of States that go beyond the matter in which he's dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.441" offset="18957145">Now, I'd like to deal for one minute about the matter or the situation of the Secretary of State in conclusiveness of the statement of the Secretary of State in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.613" offset="19009808">We are faced here for the first time to my knowledge where the Court being asked to take the word of the Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.966" offset="19043244">Now, the present Secretary of State as to what policy was 100 years ago and what the intervening policy, we do not doubt that the Secretary of State has the right, as a political matter, to state the present policy of this Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.184" offset="19104057">But it seems to me that the reason for the rule that -- that requires this Court to -- and this Court has held it requires it to follow the policy of the political departments is completely lacking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4763.514" offset="19157452">What are the reasons that are assigned for that rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.988" offset="19167274">First of all, here, the sources are immediately available.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.756" offset="19182425">The same source is available to this Court as available to Secretary of States, as a matter of historical research.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.011" offset="19207398">There is no objection now to showing diplomatic correspondent, that's been raised in some cases.As a matter of fact, the Government itself publishes diplomatic correspondence 15 year -- up to 15 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.481" offset="19261315">The facts are of those of the United States' own position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.833" offset="19274689">We're not having to build into the -- and the foreign correspondence and to correspondence of the British Government and -- and get documents that are beyond the reach of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.673" offset="19318053">Now, finally, and with specific reference to what the Solicitor General says, I -- it's -- it's my position, Your Honor, that there is no clear and present danger that if this Court finds that the attorney -- that the -- the Secretary of State in arguing as an advocate in some of this cases in the past, has overstated his position about what the history of American policy is that there will be any objection or any difficulty created in -- in the field of foreign affairs to that matter, has specifically been passed on by Congress, Congress inquired of the Department whether whatever it did in this area, would affect the conduct of the present foreign policy of the United States and Secretary -- and the Assistant Legal Adviser, Mr. Jack Tate said, “No, it won't.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.315" offset="19528600">Furthermore, it seems to me, it's implicit in this Court's holding in Alabama versus Texas that if Congress, speaking arguendo, if Congress had granted 10 miles to some State -- nine miles to some States, that it would not constitutionally affect the conduct of the American foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.433" offset="19621073">It seems to me that the reason for that is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.724" offset="19634239">The three-mile limit is a -- is a limit concerned with the handling of the waters and the -- and the Solicitor General and -- and with rights in the waters, with fishing rights in the waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.107" offset="19679796">And essentially, that's what's -- what has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.847" offset="19694738">And actually, it's the subsoil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4901.239" offset="19708322">The question of the subsoil rights has been removed from -- from this litigation because everybody now admits that the United States owned the -- owns these and the State Department admits that United States owned these rights and it -- it had the right under its constitutional power to convey them and to make any division between the United States and the -- and the States that it saw fit to make.</text>

            <text syncTime="5006.751" offset="20130356">The word boundary -- if -- if Congress showed to define as a boundary in this area, an area outside of what the department happens at the moment of policy could claim as the limits of territorial water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5021.341" offset="20188766">Then, Congress had the right to give that boundary to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5027.250" offset="20212381">And I -- and I say that the history of the Act shows that it was the intention of Congress to give the States granted in where -- well, an area out to the boundaries that they've -- they -- they were able to show that they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.842" offset="20290748">And it's my contention, sir, that those boundaries are on effect -- the -- the determination if you will, sir, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.019" offset="20331499">Determination of that question needs to be (Inaudible) by the position of the United States in foreign policy because everybody admits and admitted throughout the legislation of Congress that that did not concern the matter.Congress, in the Submerged Lands Act, severed paramount rights and the conduct of foreign policy from property rights in the subsoil.</text>
            <text syncTime="5086.023" offset="20447483">So, Congress had the power -- had the right to give this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="5146.035" offset="20687496">The United States recognizes the Treaty as setting the boundary between Texas and Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.438" offset="20717171">But he goes on to say that that does not necessarily control -- I think that the State -- we, the State Department, have not had to pass on the question of what are the territorial waters of the Treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.365" offset="20772864">He -- it seems to me that he understands that there is not necessarily a connection between the two, although for many purposes, they are the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="5181.082" offset="20827721">May I go on to say, sir, that it does not seem to me that there's any practical necessity for following the State Department policy in this matter of boundaries based on what were the boundaries 100 years ago, because it will not -- there's no clear and present danger that it will embarrass the present conduct of the foreign policy to say that inconsistencies occurred in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5212.251" offset="20952377">That's really what I'm intending to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="5216.820" offset="20970663">That if -- if this Court should hold that there has been -- there have been inconsistencies in the hand -- management of foreign policies in the past and they haven't always, as the Solicitor did said, feud to the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="5232.003" offset="21031372">That determination will not embarrass present foreign policy because that's been presented to Congress and it's been presented to this Court and has -- have been decided to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5244.139" offset="21079960">Now, let me mention hereon to say simply this, that the events after 1845 are relevant only with respect to whether or not, the policy had become so strong after 1845, that -- that Florida's boundary could not be approved by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5266.856" offset="21170761">It seems to me that the determining factor there is here -- this approval by Congress of the Florida boundary was not done in a corner, it was done with Mr. Seward who may -- gave a fairly clear statement of this present foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5283.395" offset="21236903">In 1862, he was still Secretary of State, he was seating right there in Washington and again, he was silent on this policy which brings me simply to point out to Your Honors that this -- that the circumstance in this whole history that convinces -- that is -- it's more convincing, it's convincing to me that the Solicitor General can't be right as to what the people then understood about foreign policy, is the circumstance that the man who supposedly formulated this policy and who knew it better than anybody that's now alive did not protest at the very time these Acts were going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.243" offset="21432299">If you -- it's a -- it's a matter of fact that Mr. Jefferson who's founded it and Mr. Adams who was the peace commissioner, Mr. Madison, Mr. Monroe, none of them raised any question about these three and six-league boundaries -- boundary stated in that term in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="5350.406" offset="21505024">That John Quincy Adams and Clay and Gallatin and Rush who were against and Adams and Richard Rush who negotiated the Treaty of 1818, John Quincy Adams and Middleton, who had negotiated with Russia on this matter of the Ukase of 1821 that Francis (Inaudible) who was the man intimately involved with this matter in the Falkland Islands, that Daniel Webster who wrote on this territoriality of ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.410" offset="21621008">And John C. Calhoun was all around in an active public life at the time that Texas was recognized that nobody said anything about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5407.865" offset="21734797">Why did Mr. Seward saying what he had said to Spain, why didn't he say something -- why did he draft the -- the Alaska Treaty including these broad water boundaries instead of -- as we probably would under the Solicitor General and the State Department would today, define the islands where they -- a belt of -- of territorial waters going around it?</text>

            <text syncTime="5474.848" offset="22002813">I'm going to continue the argument made by Judge Hart and Mr. Dougherty on the grounds that are common or joint to all of the defendant States in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5486.049" offset="22047535">My argument is confined to two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5489.032" offset="22059551">Number one, that geographically and historically, the Gulf of Mexico presents a special situation in which a three-league boundary has been recognized and established for all of the Gulf States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5500.316" offset="22104586">And the second is that Congress has the power to recognize and establish the coastal boundaries of the States irrespective of conflicting theories of international law and prior practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5512.027" offset="22151502">And Congress did thus just that in the passage of the Submerged Lands Act and exercised that power in favor of the contentions made here by the Gulf States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.279" offset="22196537">This covers pages 88 to 145 of our joint brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5527.485" offset="22213360">Some references had been made to portions of that brief previously and I'm going to -- of course, with 167 pages to cover in 30 minutes, that's -- that's -- and I can't go through in its entirety, I'll more less going to hit the high points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5541.825" offset="22270621">As far as the geographic situation that was faced by the Congress when it adopted the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.435" offset="22313148">Any well-scaled map of the North American Continent will show that the Gulf of Mexico is landlocked except from the Florida Strait in the western extremity, Florida Strait is right here in the western extremity between the Peninsula of San Antonio and Yucatan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5568.944" offset="22379186">This water body is exactly what its name connotes, namely to track the water extending from the ocean or a sea into an indentation of the coastline of a country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5579.011" offset="22419414">Soundings appear on both of the early and recent maps of the area, which show the shoalness of the waters from many miles seaward from inland.</text>
            <text syncTime="5587.502" offset="22453373">The shoalness of the waters is particularly reflected as early as 1705 when the geographer for the (Inaudible) of France prepared a -- a map.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.230" offset="22492244">And of course, this was after the discovery of La Salle in 1682 and after the taking of the possession of the Louisiana territory by the Iberville in 1698 and 1699.</text>
            <text syncTime="5608.900" offset="22538951">This map is attached to all the map appendix, the map's I'm referring to Map Appendix 5.</text>

            <text syncTime="6066.339" offset="24368776">And I had his very words here in which he says this, “By the definition of lands beneath navigable waters, Senate Joint Resolution 13 recognizes that area within the three-mile limit or within such greater distance as a State's seaward boundary, existed in the Gulf of Mexico or any of the Great Lakes at the time such State became a member of the Union or -- is here -- heretofore approved by Congress, is within the territory of the States and the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6096.066" offset="24487685">This assertion of congressional policy will confirm the fact that such an area is within the jurisdiction of the United States and therefore, it is subject to legislation by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6107.874" offset="24534915">I would like to further point out that that -- on that particular point, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, that in the Submerged Lands Act, Congress again recognized that and restated it when it enacted into law Section 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="6123.689" offset="24598131">The United States retains all the navigational servitudes so forth and rights in and power and regulation and control of lands in navigable waters for the Constitution of purpose of commerce, navigation, national defense and international affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6140.464" offset="24665213">So if there was any doubt about that, it was removed from that portion of the Submerged Lands Act itself, then we go a little farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="6148.672" offset="24698023">And we have as further proof of that, another Act of Congress, the OCS Act in which Congress in Section 4 says this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6157.002" offset="24731355">And the OCS Act as Your Honors well know, “Brings the authority of the United States Government to extract the natural resources from whatever boundary the State has in the Gulf to the edge of the outer Continental Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="6169.867" offset="24782869">For instance, in the case of Louisiana from where this black line isn't exactly the 254 to where the red line is, the outer Continental Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="6177.522" offset="24813484">So therefore, they say only two people can take these resources from the subsoil.</text>
            <text syncTime="6181.846" offset="24830725">And that's either the State or the Federal Government and Section 4 of the OCS Act says, “The Constitution and laws of the civil and political jurisdiction of the United States are extended to the subsoil.</text>
            <text syncTime="6193.568" offset="24877641">It didn't open above territorial waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="6195.867" offset="24886836">To the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf and to all artificial lands and so forth for development and moving to the same extent as if the outer Continental Shelf were an area of exclusive federal jurisdiction located within a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="6213.076" offset="24955695">So, I think that that made the matter very, very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="6217.364" offset="24972831">I also think that it made it very domestic as was set on the floor of the Senate by the gentleman that sponsored the passage of it and of course, as you know, the Act that was passed undoubtedly, I think the Government even conceived that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6233.192" offset="25036152">And also, in face of the fact that there were four amendments in the Senate in which they attempted to limit everyone three miles and to say so exclusively that was an amendment by Anderson, by Senator Madison, by Senator Monroney and by Representative Yates in the House and all of those who are conclusively defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6252.360" offset="25112848">And inserted in the Act was a specific turn not more than three marine leagues in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="6260.318" offset="25144613">And where did that come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="6262.003" offset="25151404">That came from every historic act of possession and control and dominion in the Gulf, Acts of which I would like to tell you about in just one second.</text>
            <text syncTime="6271.649" offset="25189961">But one of which, the United States is a party to, has been a party to, is still a party to and continues to recognize.</text>
            <text syncTime="6278.151" offset="25215979">And that is the International Boundary Commission opposite our brief in page 102, reproduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="6284.422" offset="25241057">Here is the wording, “International boundary begins three leagues -- begins three leagues from land and opposite the mouth of the Rio Grande.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6293.187" offset="25276165">And then it marks off to make sure what league is, it says one marine league.</text>
            <text syncTime="6300.035" offset="25303542">So, I submit to this Court that Congress was deliberate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6304.056" offset="25319633">Congress was positive when it put those clauses into the Submerged Lands Act and the OCS Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6311.368" offset="25348890">It took all of those historical facts into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="6315.072" offset="25363623">It considered the 16 special Acts of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6317.761" offset="25374386">The 12 Treaties in the conventions and the Presidential Proclamation, the boundary map, all of which were referring to boundaries in excess of three miles seaward.</text>
            <text syncTime="6328.145" offset="25415973">I have those, I'm not going to repeat them, they're all in our joint brief at the pages that I referred Your Honors to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6335.102" offset="25443767">I'm going to briefly run across some of the history because that is the next portion of the argument assigned to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="6343.008" offset="25475427">Congress therefore, was not being frivolous in recognizing boundaries in the Gulf in excess of three miles.Congress treated the Gulf as a special situation by reason of the prior established boundaries of three leagues which I mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="6355.865" offset="25526836">In so doing, it adhered to its policy of treating uniformly and consistently, all coastal States of this Union from a regional standpoint, those bothering on the Gulf, those on the Atlantic and the Pacific and those in the Great Lakes, because as Your Honors -- as Mr. Justice's well know, in the Great Lakes is that the boundary would be to the international boundary line.</text>
            <text syncTime="6378.452" offset="25617220">Prior to the original 13 colonies, Spain, France and Great Britain maintained dominion and control over the submerged lands in the Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="6388.223" offset="25656299">La Salle issued his proclamation in 1682.</text>

            <text syncTime="6400.422" offset="25705096">And it included all of the seas, the harbors, the ports and adjacent straits in the sea or Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="6407.614" offset="25733831">When France ceded this land and water territory into Spain in 1762, France ceded everything, except all that it claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6416.287" offset="25768521">As Spain likewise continued to maintain that -- the same claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="6421.601" offset="25789733">France, as I have mentioned previously, not only claimed under La Salle's proclamation, but according to the procession asserted by the Iberville.</text>
            <text syncTime="6429.121" offset="25819826">Spain ceded the Florida, south and east of the Mississippi River to Great Britain in 1763.</text>
            <text syncTime="6434.826" offset="25842709">And shortly thereafter, King George made his proclamation which said that the seaward boundaries of East and West Florida which is now opposite Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, he said, “Including all islands within six leagues of the coast.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6449.464" offset="25901223">Then, in 1783, Great Britain ceded all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6453.156" offset="25915956">And I mentioned that word purposely that she had to Spain.</text>
            <text syncTime="6456.531" offset="25929540">And when Spain came along and retroceded the Louisiana territory to France, it was again described as the same area which it had previously received from France and Spain.</text>

            <text syncTime="6491.248" offset="26068407">Well, I -- I don't quite follow your question, but giving it the -- the imports that I agree, that -- that I understand, I don't think that that's the question here, that the question of the breadth of the territorial sea is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6508.552" offset="26137579">I'm only trying to show to Your Honors that that -- for instance, that clause at last sentence of Section 4 of the Act, that wasn't put there in the Congress haphazardly, it means something because the Court, in my humble opinion, has to construe the whole Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6523.843" offset="26198706">And when it says prior to, I mean that it has to consider all, and that Congress consider in passing this Act, all of the historical acts of possession exercised by these former territories which led up to the use of the word “league” as a measurement in the sea because France and Spain always used the term “league”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6549.476" offset="26301315">And that is terrifically important, if Your Honor please, when it comes to Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, because our Enabling Acts in each case which were passed in Louisiana some eight years before, in Mississippi a year and a half, Alabama, the same thing, Florida, quite some while before -- those Enabling Acts all said that it will be having a perimeter barrier and that will include all islands within three leagues of the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="6577.617" offset="26413850">In the case of Louisiana, three leagues from land, in the case of Florida and six leagues from shore in the case of Mississippi and Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="6585.852" offset="26446764">And I'd like to point this out to Your Honors, that when start off by three leagues from Louisiana then out the Mississippi, just out in order to make it uniform, exactly these six leagues from shore in the case of Alabama and Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="6596.971" offset="26491277">So, the Congress of the United States, when it admitted these territories, it tried to establish a uniform boundary in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="6606.370" offset="26528893">And it almost certainly did as near as could be done at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6612.842" offset="26554702">Because then, we weren't worried about oil in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="6617.056" offset="26571630">The only thing we were fighting about then was land and what the inhabitants would receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="6623.389" offset="26596916">And when they said all islands, if there were people on those islands, our country, the United States growing with migration, wanted the possession of all of those lands and the possession of the intervening waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="6636.627" offset="26649893">The fact which the Government now concedes as far as Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana are concerned, is something which was not conceded when we argued this case on April the 8th.</text>
            <text syncTime="6645.721" offset="26686255">So, coming to the answer of your question, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="6650.852" offset="26706735">When -- when -- and I don't disagree with your decision in California, Texas and Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="6655.622" offset="26725857">I -- I'm not even intimate to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6658.208" offset="26736201">But I am saying this, that to determine what our boundary was prior to or at the time we were admitted to the Union, we are granted the right and this was shown by the debates and the history of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6671.785" offset="26790536">We are granted the right to show this Court our historical acts of possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="6676.930" offset="26811120">What -- what the territory of Orleans consisted of and what it consisted of at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6683.384" offset="26836929">In other words, the wording as -- as it comes to the particular Act as they existed at that time, because there were many physical matters that came into being to form as they existed at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6698.291" offset="26896488">You take for example the Treaty with Spain in 1819.</text>
            <text syncTime="6702.341" offset="26912684">John Quincy Adams told Spain, “We reserved at the mouth of the river Sabine right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6708.948" offset="26939120">We want the -- we want the shore on the east, you can have the shore to the west, but we want all the islands.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6714.347" offset="26960750">And Spain bulked a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6715.742" offset="26966392">Spanish Minister was de Onis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6717.940" offset="26975169">And John Quincy Adams says, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6720.640" offset="26985932">He says, “My offer to you is withdrawing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6723.531" offset="26997530">It is no longer obligatory on this Government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6726.726" offset="27010278">Later, the Treaty with Spain was concluded in 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="6730.980" offset="27027310">And what did it state then -- say then?</text>
            <text syncTime="6733.122" offset="27035878">It said, “From the mouth of the river Sabine on the Gulf of Mexico in the sea.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6739.398" offset="27060955">That was the -- at that time that was the southwest boundary of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6745.228" offset="27084257">And when Texas came along in 1836, and defined its boundary as from the Sabine river, three leagues from land, it necessarily became the southeastern boundary of the Republic of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="6757.617" offset="27133889">So, where did that come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="6759.640" offset="27141935">Where did that history originate?</text>
            <text syncTime="6761.864" offset="27150817">It originated from the -- Spain, France -- I mean, France, Spain, France again, from the territory of Orleans, our Act of Admission, our Enabling Act, Louisiana's Act of Admission, the Act of -- the same of Mississippi, the same of Alabama, the same of Florida, the same of the Republic of Texas and it was recognized as an international boundary by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.</text>

            <text syncTime="6805.207" offset="27324165">It is my contention that under the Submerged Lands Act, Alabama can only claim three leagues from our coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="6811.339" offset="27348720">But when -- I say this, that when the Enabling Act of Alabama and Mississippi was passed, that they were talking about the land around Biloxi, the Gulfport and Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="6822.711" offset="27394173">When they said six leagues from shore, they meant 18 miles into the Gulf of Mexico, pass ship by -- of Horn Island and all those particular areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="6831.930" offset="27431058">That's my contention insofar as little States were concerned and that Congress, three leagues from coast all out at three leagues in coast I assume, practically even off the (Inaudible) Island with similar distance from Horn, Cat and Ship Island.</text>

            <text syncTime="6865.285" offset="27564492">Well, I can't very well cover the remaining portion of my argument in that time, so I'll come to pages 142, 143 and 144 of the joint brief and call the Court's attention to that and to assert Submerged Lands Act as enacted with the approval -- with the approval of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="6886.538" offset="27649546">That was intended to settle this policy matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6889.119" offset="27659891">And that settlement should be allowed to stand because the plain purpose of Congress should not be thwarted because other solutions or alternative means of settling these matters were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="6899.711" offset="27702209">The very self -- same argument made to the Solicitor General to this Court to date was made in Congress and Congress rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6906.287" offset="27728541">It rejected it in favor of a three-league boundary in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="6910.735" offset="27746304">Because only the United States, only the Congress of the United States can fix a boundary in the Gulf of Mexico or anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="6918.501" offset="27777337">Only the Congress has that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="6920.642" offset="27785906">And Congress acted pursuant to its authority and no further argument is needed that the Congress and the President had made it clear as I said previously that no one but the United States and the several States composing it, can take the minerals of our Continental Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="6936.212" offset="27848182">And it remains a domestic question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6938.870" offset="27858840">Senator Cordon stated this prior to the adoption of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6942.829" offset="27874722">And I say that if this -- this disposition must be made, if -- if the Court comes to this question that if it must be made on the basis of a territorial boundary, then logic, sense and the proper application of the recognized rules of statutory construction requires that the Submerged Lands Act be considered as declaring the extent of the national territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="6966.141" offset="27967927">In other words, if there is a national boundary in the Gulf of Mexico, it has to be three leagues from coast because that power is Congress' power and it had affected that boundary by the passage of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6979.517" offset="28021426">And I submit that all that's needed to give so simple and reasonable proposition is to construe the Submerged Lands Act and its (Inaudible), the OCS Act in the proper light and in the effect intended by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6995.864" offset="28086836">And on that point and I say again, furthermore, it is beyond dispute that the United States now has a national boundary in the Gulf of Mexico, three leagues from coast as established by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 and ratified by the Gadsden Treaty several years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="7014.785" offset="28162487">I thank Your Honors.</text>
