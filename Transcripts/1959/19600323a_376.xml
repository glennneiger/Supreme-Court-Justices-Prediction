            <text syncTime="26.241" offset="208332">Mr. Elman.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="26.941" offset="211153">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.456" offset="233200">This case, which is here from the Sixth Circuit and the next case, the Stanton case, which is here from the Second Circuit, also presents the question of distinguishing between gifts and income for federal tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.491" offset="333302">As Mr. Rauh pointed out unlike the Kaiser case, these two cases present the issue in the more familiar general context of payments in commercial and employment relationships and they do not involve the special differentiating factors as to strike benefit payments upon which Mr. Rauh has relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.298" offset="436537">The facts of the Duberstein case are extremely simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.415" offset="453047">They are not in dispute and indeed, they are based entirely upon the testimony of the taxpayer himself and his account.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.288" offset="488573">Mr. Duberstein is the president of an Iron and Metal Company in Dayton, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.319" offset="524622">That company did business with another corporation in New York City, the Mohawk Metal Company of which the president was Mr. Berman.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.846" offset="578748">And the transactions between these two companies were usually conducted over the telephone, conversations between these two men.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.922" offset="623052">And occasionally, Mr. Berman would inquire of Mr. Duberstein if he knew the names of certain customers who used chemical products which were sold by the Mohawk Company but not by Duberstein's company and if Mr. Duberstein had such information, he would furnish it to Mr. Berman.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.960" offset="739244">He testified and we accept his testimony entirely that he gave this information pituitously without any hope or expectation of payment or reward.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.204" offset="788146">Nonetheless, in 1951, as Mr. Rauh has told you, he received from the Mohawk Company, a Cadillac for which the company paid $4250 and the ultimate question in the case is whether that's a gift or income to Mr. Duberstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.971" offset="871215">Now, the circumstances in which that Cadillac was given were described by Mr. Duberstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.738" offset="918340">And again, I wish to make it clear that we accept this testimony and all the implications of it entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.616" offset="953866">Mr. Berman called Mr. Duberstein on the telephone from New York and he, Mr. Berman, told that due to the fact that the information I had given him was so helpful that he felt he wanted to give me a present and I told him he didn't owe me anything and he said, “Well, he had a Cadillac car as a gift.”</text>
            <text syncTime="232.472" offset="1033279">Now I should send to New York to receive it which I finally did.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.357" offset="1048848">I told him he owed me nothing and I didn't expect anything for the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.165" offset="1068074">I didn't intend to be compensated, but he insisted that I accept this Cadillac car.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.202" offset="1096182">On cross-examination, he was asked whether he thought he would have gotten this car, had he not given the information to Mr. Berman.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.957" offset="1139231">His answer was, “I don't think so.”</text>

            <text syncTime="273.815" offset="1198582">Had you not given him this information, would you still have gotten this Cadillac car” and the taxpayer answered, “I don't think so.”</text>

          <turn speaker="philip_elman" startTime="328.289" stopTime="615.079">
            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="328.289" offset="1416547">No, he wasn't -- he wasn't asked that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.253" offset="1424384">I think I should say, in fairness to Mr. Duberstein that when he discovered in 1954, he did not show it on his income tax return, he treated as a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.471" offset="1465240">He found out about this thing apparently the first time, three years later in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.297" offset="1488541">The Internal Revenue Service was auditing Mohawk's return in New York and they discovered that Mohawk had deducted the cost of this car as a business expense, treating it as a payment in the nature of a finder's fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.577" offset="1553638">At that point, the Internal Revenue Service again had look at Mr. Duberstein's return and inquired of him as to the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.921" offset="1599091">And Mr. Duberstein's account on his instructions got in touch with Mohawk's account and asked why it was, that Mohawk had taken this deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.879" offset="1654888">Apparently, Mr, Duberstein was not only surprised.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.046" offset="1663561">He was quite (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="392.072" offset="1671711">This had been done and the accountant testified, this is on page 21 of the record that he had talked – he -- Mohawk's accountant that is, had talked with Mr. Berman, explained to Mr. Berman that the Cadillac was recorded as a gift, it would not be deductible as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.913" offset="1763035">Mr. Berman wanted to know how it would be deducted and presumably the accountant told him it would be deductible if it was treated by the corporation as its business expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.041" offset="1803577">Now, I think it might be pointed out here that from the Government's standpoint, form the standpoint of just the revenue involved getting additional taxes, we would be in a more advantageous position if this were, in fact, a gift from Mr. Berman personally as individual capacity to Mr. Duberstein because in that event, even though Mr. Duberstein would report it as income, he would treat it as a gift assuming it was a valid gift on the analysis which I propose to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.486" offset="1953311">Berman, of course, could not deduct it, personal gifts are not deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.021" offset="1971493">The corporation could not deduct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.659" offset="1986017">And as a matter of fact, if the -- since the corporate funds were being used for this purpose, there might -- would it be a proper case of treating that $4250 which was used for that purpose by Berman so that he could make a gift in his individual capacity to Duberstein, he would be using corporation funds and there would be a constructive distribution to him on which he would pay tax so the corporation couldn't take the deduction on the money that was used to pay the car and neither could Berman.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.817" offset="2126660">Now, so that, as I say, the question is to whether it's gift or not, it doesn't really depend on whether Government is going to benefit it from a tax standpoint and it shouldn't depend on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.626" offset="2181831">Now, on these facts which are undisputed, the Tax Court held that it was not a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.228" offset="2212237">The Court of Appeals reversed the Tax Court and held it was a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.273" offset="2228433">And although they both reached opposite conclusions, both Courts stated the question in precisely the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.580" offset="2269706">And you will find a regular pattern through the gift appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.988" offset="2303352">The opinions are all pretty read in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.366" offset="2316831">The question whether it's a gift depends upon – is a question of fact depending upon the intention of the donor.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.837" offset="2346715">If he intended to make a gift, it's a gift and if he did not intend to make a gift, it's not a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.231" offset="2368345">Generalizations cannot safely be made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.150" offset="2379943">Each case turns upon its own particular facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.036" offset="2391542">Therefore, we have to look to all the circumstances in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.483" offset="2409305">And that formulation of the issue in terms of looking to the intention of the donor, did he or did he not intend to make a gift has we believe contributed to a good deal of the confusion that one finds going through the hundred odd cases that have been decided in this broad area.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.420" offset="2533021">The intention of the donor to make a gift that is the test.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_elman" startTime="617.824" stopTime="813.059">
            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="617.824" offset="2574712">Well, Mr. Justice Black, we suggest that the intention to make a gift, looking to the donor to see what his state of mind was in relation to this payment requires and we think that the decisions of the lower courts as well as this Court have really made this inquiry although they haven't put it in precisely the terms in which we have had them on, it really requires an inquiry into the reasons for the payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.004" offset="2739388">The difference between a Christmas cheque to an employee and a Christmas cheque to a son does not lie in any difference as to the intention of the donor to make a gift in the sense that he intends to give everything for legal and beneficial interest in the property being transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.557" offset="2837608">The intention to make the gift language is taken from the property law where the -- where for purposes of distinguishing between a gift and a loan or a gift and a trust or sale of (Inaudible) A transfers something to B and the inquiry and its controlling its decisiveness, did A intend to make a gift?</text>
            <text syncTime="705.029" offset="2923499">Now if that were the -- if that were the test for tax purposes, you would have no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.733" offset="2950353">Every time there was a gift in the property in contract law sense that would be it.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.611" offset="2973863">There would be no need to go any further, but if there's anything that's clear and there's somewhat confused field, it is that the property contract law definition of gift cannot control and it's never been thought to be controlling because obviously, there are many categories of voluntary payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.995" offset="3071352">They're not merely payments by employers and employees, but there are many categories of voluntary payments, gifts in the property contract common-law sense, which are treated as taxable income to the recipient, not merely bonuses to employees but such a common place of gratuities as tips and bonuses, honorary and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.075" offset="3179708">And how do you -- what's -- how do you differentiate that kind of “gift” which is taxable to the recipient from the kind of gift which isn't and that -- and you can't answer that question by saying, “It's the intention of the donor to make a gift”, because in all cases, he intends to make a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.041" offset="3255568">If a head waiter shows you to a fine table in a restaurant, you can say to him, “I am so grateful and I want to show my appreciation for your courtesy and your kindness, I'm going to give you $5 and I intend this to be a gift.”</text>
            <text syncTime="803.707" offset="3318157">Now, the intention -- the intention to make a gift is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.398" offset="3328920">There maybe even an intention that the -- that the waiter should not have to pay income tax on it, that's immaterial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1322.763" offset="5394474">Now, we do not contend and we could not contend that there's anything in the Federal Tax Law that prevents corporations from making gifts, they're not charitable – the leading case in this area is the case decided by the Supreme Court of New Jersey not to argue when Mr. Justice Brennan was sitting there, the 18 Smith case, which recognizes that corporations too sharing the benefits of our society may properly be called upon to share in the burden and a corporation where it may properly do so under -- under the applicable state law may make a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.941" offset="5575137">But when you're dealing with a -- dealing it with a corporation which is making a gift not to the Red Cross or not to the victims of a disaster but to an employee or to someone who has rendered a business service of value to the corporation, then you have -- then as -- then you don't have to worry too much about the issues of fact or the triers of fact because if you have really a double barreled presumption, the presumption which almost all these cases recognized that where -- where a payment is made from an employer or an employee, there's a -- the presumption is but it's not a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.878" offset="5754859">And the second perhaps most important presumption, more important presumption in this context is that corporate -- officers of the corporation, trustees of the corporate funds, they are fiduciary, it is a bridge of trust for an officer of a corporation to make a gift of the corporation's property to a friend for personal reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.063" offset="5851617">Ordinarily, it is presumed that the corporation directors and officers do not engage in such breaches of trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.965" offset="5879202">They are not committing a misuse or ways of the corporation's assets and that therefore, when they do make a payment where it is conceivable that motives of a personal nature entered into it, you -- you are entitled to presume unless the taxpayer should undertake to show that the officers who made them this gift whether the breach of trust and it's been -- usually corporate funds for that purpose is really practical to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.908" offset="6027055">In the absence of any attempt by the taxpayer to make such a showing, there's a reasonable basis for the presumption that the expenditure was made for a proper corporate purpose and a proper corporate purpose is to further the business interest of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.169" offset="6088077">And if that in fact is so – the presumption at least carries you that far in the absence of the evidence to the contrary, there is really no difficulty so far as trying these case are concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2296.693" offset="9290167">Now, if Your Honors please, while Mr. Elman has given the facts in this case, and then very fair there are one or two things that he hasn't said that I think ought to be said in order to clarify the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.476" offset="9393298">Duberstein and Berman, Berman was the head of Mohawk were friends and as Mr. Rauh said, they have frequent business dealings with each other and frequent conversations over the phone and they were very friendly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.962" offset="9487235">And every once in a while, Berman would ask Duberstein if he knew of somebody that handled a certain product that Duberstein didn't handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.988" offset="9543346">On this particular day, in this particular instance, Berman said to Duberstein, “Do you know of anybody who might be interested in buying so and so,” mentioning materials and Duberstein said, “I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.846" offset="9626728">Why don't you try so and so and so and so, because I haven't any idea whether they can use them or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.620" offset="9661837">Now that's the last of Duberstein heard about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.415" offset="9697050">Until months and months later, now mind you Duberstein didn't contact any of these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.463" offset="9729233">He had absolutely nothing to do with trying to see what (Inaudible) material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.285" offset="9752534">He didn't talk to any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.782" offset="9758490">He didn't write any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.115" offset="9763819">He had no communication with any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.761" offset="9782418">And the telephone call comes from Berman and he said, “I got a Cadillac car and I want to give you as a gift.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.163" offset="9811989">And Duberstein said, “I don't want a Cadillac, sir I've got two cars [Laughter].”</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.057" offset="9843649">I got a car from myself a Cadillac and I've got a car for my wife and he said, “But you got children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.479" offset="9865279">You could always use the car and I want you to take the car.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.175" offset="9880116">So he took the car.</text>

            <text syncTime="2799.654" offset="11302013">For 15 years we've been going by the usual and accepted way of doing businesses as far as gifts were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.960" offset="11355199">Now, if there is to be a clarification and the gift is to be by motive and not by intent then it's for the Congress to say, and not from the Supreme Court of the United States just as in (Inaudible) cases, where people who were giving gifts for answering questions on the television and weren't paying taxes on them, they didn't come to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.473" offset="11469302">They went to the Congress and the Congress passed Section 74, which cured that situation and which made all of these gifts taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.820" offset="11514650">And that's what ought to be done in this case if there's any question of the Solicitor General wanting motive taken for intent and wanting clarifications and all that sort of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.360" offset="11556864">This Section is very clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="2869.517" offset="11581419">It needs addition of the things that they want should be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.436" offset="11609109">And exclusions from gross income include gifts, requests, and devices, the value of the property acquired by gift request, devise or inheritance etc.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.665" offset="11670026">Now, that's very plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.378" offset="11676923">Now if there's to be an enlargement of that, then it is for the Congress of the United States to say and not for the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.656" offset="11717987">Now, getting back, I had all of these various distinctions that I was going to make in the various cases that have been cited but I am not going to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3036.477" offset="12249318">And we've gone so far as to say that the taxpayers' affirmative evidence made itself contain the necessary challenge and furnish the material for such analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.762" offset="12306369">We find that the taxpayers' evidence clearly and distinctly offered proof that the Cadillac car was in fact a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.884" offset="12342941">It was not challenged by contrary proofs or destructive analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.093" offset="12375751">It maybe contended that in such a case as this, we should add suspicion into presumption of correctness to aid the Commissioner's assessment of the deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.998" offset="12431339">This we cannot do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.048" offset="12439594">This matter should be decided on evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.280" offset="12452446">In the case of Landsberg versus the Commissioner -- versus the Commissioner supra, Judge Simon's characterized such attitude as follows that most the Board's finding rest upon mere suspicion upon an inference and generosity of the kind here involved is so rare that it must necessarily from that fact alone be suspected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.474" offset="12553279">We hold that the taxpayer met his burden of proof that the Cadillac was a gift and the decision of the Tax Court is accordingly reversed.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="3126.007" offset="12607404">Mr. Elman, you may take your final minutes now.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="3127.783" offset="12614510">Thank you (inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.500" offset="12621406">Mr. Kusworm referred to the Pot O' Gold case, a case in the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.143" offset="12639901">I would like to take a minute to discuss the problem with that case raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.635" offset="12657873">In that case a radio show picks a name out of the telephone directory at random and called you up if you are home, you got $900 and the Tax Court said, “That was a pure case of the recipient receiving something for nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.352" offset="12720776">He did nothing at all and therefore it was a gift.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.420" offset="12737076">Now, that something for nothing test has been much relied upon by the taxpayers in this area and I think it would -- might be worthwhile to say just a few words about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.234" offset="12780335">It's taken from the opinion of Mr. Justice Reed in the American Dental Case in 318 U.S., which was a cancellation of indebtedness case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.251" offset="12820355">And that case itself has been very substantially limited if not overruled in the subsequent Jacobson case where Mr. Justice Reed dissented on the ground of this Court, it was being overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.529" offset="12873540">But apart from that, the something for nothing test which focuses on what the donee did is wholly inconsistent with the intention of the -- of the donor to make a gift test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.046" offset="12935607">Intention test whatever its defects as a formulation that at least focuses the inquiry on the man who makes -- who makes the transfer on his state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.592" offset="12989733">The something for nothing test says, well it doesn't make any difference what the intention, motive and so on whether it was a selfish interest, business interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.385" offset="13028916">If the man who receives has received something for which he has given nothing, then to him it's a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.818" offset="13058696">Now those cases, Pot O' Gold and similar cases were all decided before Glenshaw.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.840" offset="13082728">In the Glenshaw case, this Court held that a windfall maybe income.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3250.645" stopTime="3258.328">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="3250.645" offset="13105925">Isn't it true also that the Pot O' Gold case was expressly corrected by the 1954 statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_elman" startTime="3258.328" stopTime="3312.656">
            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="3258.328" offset="13136645">Yes, the 1954 Code does take care of prize and that kind of a prize would be taxable, but we think the Pot O' Gold was wrong under the 1939 Code for the simple reason, that a windfall and a gift are not synonymous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.454" offset="13213236">In Pot O' Gold or in any other situation where somebody has received something for nothing, it's a windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.221" offset="13244270">Take the purest case of a windfall, a literal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.971" offset="13255241">A man is walking down the street and the wind blows a hundred dollar bill in his direction, he reaches out, puts it in his pocket, he looks around, there's nobody in sight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.002" offset="13291395">Is that a gift, certainly not?</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.170" offset="13300067">Its not even a gift in the property law says because the original owner of the bill may be still looking for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.289" offset="13320547">He's not intending to make any gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.700" offset="13330160">And even -- even where -- even where the gift again in quotation mark --</text>

            <text syncTime="3315.742" offset="13366314">I don't -- I can't cite any cases but the treasury cases (Inaudible) to this and I think that under the rationale of Glenshaw it's income then it is certainly not a gift.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3326.491" stopTime="3330.277">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="3326.491" offset="13409364">It didn't tell the -- it didn't tell if it has lost it and comes around again.</text>

          <turn speaker="philip_elman" startTime="3330.277" stopTime="3410.303">
            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="3330.277" offset="13424515">If it's -- if it's kept under a claim of right and is unrestricted use in enjoyment, I take it the decision of this Court say it's income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.634" offset="13457951">Now, this point that there is -- that there is nothing done by the recipient has -- has attributed -- contributed to a good deal of confusion in this area particularly in the Widows Bonus cases because there the widow has herself not rendered any services and the courts said, well she hasn't done anything, she's -- it's something for nothing as far as she is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.799" offset="13566516">And the courts I must confess have been -- have been seriously rather restraining this area by the rulings of the Commissioner himself who we think was responsible for this by initially making an erroneous ruling which the courts followed and then withdrawing it when it was too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.609" offset="13637778">Now, if the something for nothing test is -- is accepted, as I say, it would not only be in the face of everything -- of all the case law in this field which focuses on the situation from the donors our position, but it is also as a matter of analysis wrong because it confuses gifts and windfalls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.503" offset="13725341">Thank you very much.</text>
