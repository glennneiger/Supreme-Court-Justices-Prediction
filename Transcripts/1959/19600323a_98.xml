            <text syncTime="57.523" offset="333511">Mr. Collins, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Elmer B. Collins</label>
            <text syncTime="68.449" offset="377187">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.881" offset="386905">This is a direct appeal from United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, a direct appeal from the summary judgment issued by that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.039" offset="459525">The basis of the summary judgment being as I construe the Court's decision that Union Pacific Railroad Company, appellant here, in furnishing and performing for shippers, the slow service or a fast service or any and all shippers, whichever service they elect, without any tariff specification or publication of either type of service, necessarily violates the Interstate Commerce Act, Section 6, paragraph 7 and Section 1 of the Elkins Act in furnishing the slow service.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.144" offset="695986">The Court then issued an injunction enjoining the Union Pacific from performing the slow service without tariff publication or unless and until the railroad had a tariff lawfully on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission specifying the slow service or offering in published tariff form the slow service, but of course not the fast service, and specify an additional or extra charge for the slow service.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.729" offset="886262">Now we will discuss two propositions or contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.757" offset="934431">First that the furnishing of either a fast or a slow service by a railroad, and in this case Union Pacific in particular, does not without tariff publication which is never been required, which is not expressly required by statute or by any rule, order or regulation issued by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.006" offset="1055431">Furnished both or either, a slow or a fast service of the same published tariff rate, under those circumstances, does not violate either the Interstate Commerce Act or the Elkins Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.073" offset="1099630">I further contend that if there is anything wrong, however, in such furnishing of service without extra charge for the one service or tariff publication for the one service, then it involves matters that are so purely administrative.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.985" offset="1203284">That they belong within the primary jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission and should be dealt with by that Commission instead of trying to cure the problem, which I will shortly explain --</text>

            <text syncTime="307.929" offset="1335045">It does a very curious thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.519" offset="1341419">The -- the holding of the Court, the conclusions of law of the District Court are flatly to the effect that the slow service violates the Elkins Act and Section 6 (7) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.397" offset="1408920">The Court then after making those flat conclusions of law, which one would think would completely nullify the slow service, as the Court believe what it was saying, nevertheless, issues an injunction which says that “You're enjoined from performing a slow service unless you file a tariff with the Interstate Commerce Commission and have it lawfully on file there specifying the slow service and naming special charge for it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="359.683" offset="1542144">The Court, however, refused to dismiss the complaint and remand this matter to the Commission, so we can have a doubt there with all other railroads that performed both slow and fast service.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.194" offset="1600136">Now, I'd like to have this map, these maps brought in here in the hope that you can at least see the black line from the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.079" offset="1647679">The maps are in the record in this sad looking form and they require -- require quite a bit of doing to unfold them.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.352" offset="1692818">They can be unfolded and examined closely.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.561" offset="1705566">I want to give you the background of this whole situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.984" offset="1763349">Well, that's -- that's -- that puts the case in its true light if we can -- even if you we can't see them, I'll explain it [Laughs] by pointing to the northwest corner in the map.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.659" offset="1830013">There, I should say first that we have always had in the railroad business what is called “roller traffic”.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.238" offset="1876302">That's the traffic that originates at its point of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.961" offset="1899186">The producer knows no buyer, but he knows the general area within which he generally finds the customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.331" offset="1924681">So he turns it over the railroad and started rolling, as we call it, and then transfer a buyer while it's in -- it's moving for its destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.857" offset="1974836">That is a practice that is as old as railroads themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.304" offset="1996570">If he finds a buyer, he reconciles the carload or carloads to the new found customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.024" offset="2039515">This case involves lumber roller traffic and the mills are in the northwest or even in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.457" offset="2085177">There are all of these mill lumber rates from that territory to the east.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.141" offset="2111927">About 1930, the Interstate Commerce Commission in two decisions lifted or gave the long routes which are shown here in black down to Texas and to the -- through -- well through El Paso, through Denver, allowing the longer routes to participate at the same purpose tariff rates on lumber, which applied over the direct routes, and I am pointing right through the center of the (Inaudible), which is the line of the Union Pacific in red towards Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.761" offset="2338461">The -- by allowing the same rates to apply over the very long routes and some of them are 4400 miles long as compared with the direct Union Pacific routes or the routes in which the Union Pacific participates are 2200 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.701" offset="2422157">Roller lumber naturally went to these long routes that the Commission made the statutory adjustment to enable them to haul that traffic.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="591.261" offset="2468446">Does that made a part -- as part of this roller service?</text>
            <text syncTime="595.428" offset="2485060">Is that what as to what the Commission did in that at that time?</text>

            <text syncTime="2791.967" offset="11271189">That I think appropriately brings me to the question with respect to the primary jurisdiction that of course was raised in the District Court after the Commission undertook its investigation of the tariffs filed by the six other carriers and the point that was made to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.052" offset="11343600">Well, that having undertaken this investigation, the Interstate Commerce Commission had superseded the jurisdiction of the District Court for further proceedings by that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.329" offset="11396681">At this point, the case was at the answer stage, would be futile and useless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.963" offset="11419251">And that for that reason, the Court should dismiss the government's complaint and let the Commission go forward with the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.455" offset="11457181">Our answers to that are, first, that as I've already indicated, that the Union Pacific of course is not a party to the proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission and that the issues, the questions that the Commission itself will resolve in the pending proceeding are totally different than those that were considered and determined by the District Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.690" offset="11554147">I refer of course to the fact the Commission is concerned with whether or not there are undue advantages or preferences according to shippers who are in a position to take advantage of the exemptions embodied in the proposed tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.334" offset="11628753">And whether or not the -- the practice that they proposed to adopt and follow will be an unreasonable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.646" offset="11653935">Now, we are of course, in this case, are not in the least concerned with whether given the tariff provision providing for this type of service, describing the privileges and facilities that are made available to the shipper as to whether they are reasonable or unreasonable is not a matter that the District Court concerned itself with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.882" offset="11742856">Nor are we concerned with whether or not it is an undue preference or an undue advantage accorded to particular shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.604" offset="11773785">The Elkins Act, of course, outlaws any advantage and prohibits any concession, rebate or discrimination whereby property is transported at less than tariff rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.824" offset="11830627">So, we have that element to the dissimilarity of the issues in the -- in the Commission proceeding and -- and the issues that are before the District Court or were before the District Court in this Elkins Act proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="3469.850" offset="13982804">The -- you'd be amazed that the number of people who -- who picked and choose between three types of service, passenger service, same pullman fare, same railroad fare.</text>

            <text syncTime="3492.954" offset="14075173">So where -- but while the pendency of the proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission is -- is not the solution that I asked for, as you just referred to, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.790" offset="14150510">So, I want the Commission, and the Union Pacific wants the Commission, to stop piecemealing and biting off bits of this problem and saying to me, “Now, you come and file a tariff with the Commission and we'll kick it out, that will be a view of justice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.092" offset="14223757">It said that to these other six railroad but it's now reopened them for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.862" offset="14246849">But they held at their tariffs providing for 15-day hold service is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.494" offset="14265344">I say to this Court that the only question involved in what Union Pacific is doing actually is whether or not the freight rate we collect is reasonable for either or both, a slow service or a fast service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.645" offset="14329919">And we don't have to publish the type of service in the tariff because the law doesn't say so expressly and neither does the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.816" offset="14358653">I have set forth in the Union Pacific's brief a rather nasty little accusation against the Commission, which I dislike to make but it's the truth that they have piecemealed this -- their dealing with this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.824" offset="14422706">At first, they -- they opened up additional securities routes, then they -- they issued order 9, 10 which stopped anything but the fastest service that a shipper could -- the railroad could give.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.753" offset="14478399">And they've done the other thing that I've recited in their brief and then I quote from former Justice -- the late Cardozo's observations of -- of -- and basis on which he repulse the Commission for piecemealing and putting off until tomorrow the work it should do today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.760" offset="14542451">Now, if there anything wrong in what we are doing, let's have it out before the one tribunal that has the authority to apply, to cover the whole situation and provide uniformity of practices among the carriers, readjust between the securities routes and the direct routes so that none of us would be starved out of this traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.513" offset="14629386">The Commission has full investigative power and if anybody is dissatisfied of what it does, we will then -- can get judicial review of whatever it says if we feel that that's necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3757.727" offset="15134281">You don't refer to the Great Northern case that Justice Brandeis's famous and well know decision that technical questions can't be dealt with by courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.349" offset="15172733">It must be remitted to the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3809.404" offset="15340962">At page 13 of my brief, I quote some of the things that -- that moved apparently, the District Court to conclude that there was a violation of the Elkins Act here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.358" offset="15396760">He says that the slow service can trip the use of truckage and cars to provide a storage facility for transit lumber shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.819" offset="15430614">Well, every time we furnished a car or used or trucks or an engine or any of our transportation property, we are furnishing just what he's accused of doing there with our slow service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.095" offset="15479724">We do it for the fast service, we are required to furnish those things for the published tariff rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.390" offset="15504906">Now, he says further, it puts -- added an operational problems in cost fluctuations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.579" offset="15529671">In the Kirby case, the horse case, that the Government relies on them very fully, the time serviced was the normal -- was -- was not the normal, but was an intentional service to one shipper or one carload of horses and it was branded, the fast service, mind you, which they here say is normal, was branded in that case, and held by this Court to be in violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.143" offset="15639907">So what is our standard, what -- what must we do unless the Government itself is going to say how many times they can stop a train or how slowly move the traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.503" offset="15689435">The Court goes ahead and decides questions that are clearly within the Commission's administrative functions, says that, “We -- we suffer excessive per diem cost for use of foreign cars while these long routes down through Texas do the same thing and much more so, that we also have it -- the service also has a tendency to unbalance dependence, annual per diem offsets and it enables roller lumber dealers to a hard payment demurrage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.508" offset="15845439">And it also puts the” -- he says, “puts the slow lumber shipper in a better competitive position in the market.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.444" offset="15893191">Well, if it isn't the Interstate Commerce Commission's duty to decide whether this rate is reasonable for both services or whether this slow service unduly advantages the competitive situation of the slow lumber shipper, I can't imagine what the Commission's function is, and I thank you.</text>
