            <text syncTime="150.876" offset="706853">In granting the strike injunction in this cause, the district judge imposed certain conditions upon the issuance of the injunction which were protective of the interest of the employees, the defendants, and protective of the interest of the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="411.956" offset="1751228">Now, to us, this review involves the somewhat startling proposition which was approved by the Court of Appeals that a court of equity, while issuing an injunction against the strike of railroad employees, is without power to further exercise its equitable jurisdiction, to impose conditions protective of the interest of the employees against whom the injunction was issued and the public which has an interest in the settlement of labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.593" offset="1917785">Now, I think, Your Honors can best appraise and understand the question involved in the cause, in the context of the facts, which I think I can state to you in brief compass.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.426" offset="1985076">For 25 years, there were in effect, on the respondent railroads, intradivisional runs between the points of Wichita Falls, Texas, and Forgan, Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.930" offset="2055084">There were five terminals which are illustrated by the fingers on my hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.039" offset="2075564">Two runs ran from Wichita Falls to a place named Altus, one run from Altus to Elk City, one from Elk City to Woodward and one from Woodward to Forgan.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.099" offset="2119764">Those runs had been established by the collective bargaining agreements entered in -- into by the employees, which provided also that the runs that had been established and the terminals through which they ran could not be changed without notice given under the agreements and without notice or without notice given under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.948" offset="2227179">These agreements were -- were negotiated by the employees to prevent an arbitrary and unilateral action on the part of the railroad companies to change these -- just these runs.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.904" offset="2282977">Now, in violation of the agreements, on October 2nd, 1958, the carriers issued two general orders that new interdivisional runs would be established and that certain home and away-from-home terminals would be abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.820" offset="2354657">The employees asked that the orders be cancelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.387" offset="2368972">They asserted that the action of the respondents was contrary to the Railway Labor Act and contrary to the terms of the collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.296" offset="2408573">When the carriers refused to cancel their notices, the employees invoked the services of the National Mediation Board and despite the fact that the National Mediation Board took jurisdiction of the dispute, the respondents put the general orders into effect on October 19, 1958, approximately two weeks and a half after the orders were issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.726" offset="2502301">Now, the orders have this effect upon the employees whom I represent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.998" offset="2523408">Two terminals were abolished this one and this one.Home and away-from-home terminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.247" offset="2556322">The runs were made to run from Wichita Falls to Elk City and from Elk City to Forgan, Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.616" offset="2597804">The man who lived here and the man who lived here, were obliged either to travel to this point or this point, to perform their work or to move their homes from the same places to distant points.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.690" offset="2674082">An uprooting of their homes, a dissolution of family, social and religious ties were entailed by the -- by the general orders issued by these railroad companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.473" offset="2717236">In addition, the employees who have these two places, as away-from-home terminals, had their way from home terminals changed and modified and they were obliged to solicit and seek new porters living away-from-home for their turnaround runs and finding new places to eat and all of the dislocations would go to a traveling man, when he finds that his place of -- of performing his work has been changed to another location.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.692" offset="2846177">In addition to that, 10 employees were immediately furloughed by the action of the carrier in issuing these general orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.861" offset="2890794">The number of crews that had been operating between these points was reduced from five to three.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.382" offset="2920887">Now, their submissions made to the National Railroad Adjustment Board, which had not been made at this time, but which come into the case at a later point, do not involve anything other than a -- a request for disposition by the Adjustment Board of the question of whether the agreements have been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.346" offset="3012733">They do not involve the question of whether these employees are entitled to any compensation or paid for time lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.676" offset="3046066">Now, obviously, no payment in money, whatever compensate these men for the time that they must spend in travelling from their home terminals to new places to report for work, for seeking for the hardships and the burdens that they endure in moving their homes, severing their social and family and religious ties, and in seeking new places to sleep and new places to eat at newly established way from -- away-from-home terminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.572" offset="3181693">I emphasized to you, if Your Honors please, that nothing that the Adjustment Board can do -- can possibly compensate my clients for the hardships imposed upon them by the general orders of the railroad companies.</text>

            <text syncTime="916.630" offset="3769866">Now, when the -- when the employees went on strike on November 6, a temporary restraining order was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.075" offset="3823679">On a hearing on the preliminary injunction which took place in December of 1958, Judge Davidson, the -- district judge as I've told the Court before, issued the strike injunction, but imposed upon it the conditions that the status quo ante, the status quo which existed so far as working conditions were concerned which, as I say, existed before the issuance of the general orders should be restored or in lieu thereof or an alternative, if the railroad company elected.</text>

            <text syncTime="974.028" offset="3999535">Now, on December 10, which was just about a week before the hearing on the preliminary injunction, the carrier had elected to submit this matter to the Adjustment Board and to another -- a number of other disputes, committees, and national committees, which submissions are not involved in this case inasmuch as the review is limited only to the issuance of the injunction as a result of the Chicago River decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.835" offset="4154702">Now, the district judge apparently regarded the Chicago River case as requiring the issuance of this preliminary injunction despite the belated recourse to the Board, but he did not regard the case as prohibiting his exercising the traditional powers of a chancellor to protect all the litigants as well as the public in the injunction case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.402" offset="4256998">Now, the Court of Appeals regarded the Chicago River case apparently as requiring the issuance of the -- in strike injunction and as prohibiting the imposition of any protective conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1071.270" offset="4388446">Now, I submit to you that the imposition of the condition does not involved passing upon the merits of the contentions between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.904" offset="4483009">Certainly it doesn't involve passing upon merits of the contention between the parties in this case, any more than it does in any other case where a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order is under consideration by the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3311.321" offset="13348655">And I have to get some of this from a dissenting opinion of Judge Rutledge but it appear -- appears from what what the majority opinion says and what the dissenting opinion says that for a while, until there was a hearing in the case, there was a temporary order issued which prevented that transfer of work from the O.R.C to the B.R.T men.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.745" offset="13450324">The decision in this case was that no court could invade the jurisdiction of the Adjustment Board, that the thing for the O.R.C. is due, would be two of the Adjustment Board and find out and let the Board see, whether its contract gave it the right to these jobs or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.066" offset="13539662">And if they did have the right, then maybe the court in the exercise of its equity power, to protect what the sum in substance or it was that until and unless they went to the Board and got a decision of the Board that, they were entitled to the work, rather than the B.R.T., that no court, including a court of equity, give -- to give them relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.485" offset="13637360">Justice Rutledge, in a long dissent, expressed the thought that these men ought to be protected until the decision of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.919" offset="13679052">But apparently, the other members of the court thought otherwise, because he was the only one that raised that particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.984" offset="13711339">In the (Inaudible) case, which reaffirmed in the Pitney case, also written by Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.716" offset="13746239">The -- and not only reaffirmed that, Pitney case, but they said no court, state or federal, can invade the jurisdiction of the Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.587" offset="13793677">Now, we understand that that simply means that this Adjustment Board has been set up to decide these questions and that the no court can interfere in anyway with respect to any part evidence, you'd have to take it then, that's been decided.</text>
