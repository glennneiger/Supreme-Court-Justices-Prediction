            <text syncTime="14.240" offset="56947">Mr. Greene, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold H. Greene</label>
            <text syncTime="16.524" offset="66038">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.102" offset="80353">This is an appeal from the judgment of the District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia in which the Court granted the writ of habeas corpus to the appellee and declared Article 2(11) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice unconstitutional in so far as it applies to civilian dependents versus accompanying the armed forces who are convicted or tried for noncapital offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.990" offset="179931">The appellee was the wife of the soldier stationed in Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.277" offset="197068">In May of 1957, both the appellee and her husband were accused and charged under the Uniform Code with unpremeditated murder in violation of Article 118(2) of that code.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.133" offset="252447">In two specifications, it was alleged that the appellee and her husband killed their one-year-old son.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.968" offset="279824">Subsequently, the charge was reduced from unpremeditated murder to manslaughter in violation of Article 119 of the Uniform Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.380" offset="321515">And the appellee -- both the appellee and her husband pleaded guilty to that charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.745" offset="346906">The appellee did, at the time of the trial, object to the jurisdiction of the Court on the ground that she was a civilian and therefore not subject constitutionally to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.530" offset="402077">This objection was overruled and pursuant to the plea of guilty that both the appellee and her husband were found guilty and the appellee was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.658" offset="446589">The judgment and the sentence were approved by the convening authority and by the Board of Review and ultimately by the Court of Military Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.814" offset="483161">A habeas corpus petition was filed in the Southern District of West Virginia where the appellee was incarcerated and the Court held, as I stated, that Article 2(11) was unconstitutional as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.620" offset="542407">Now this case, of course is like the case – like the two cases before this Court in Covert and Krueger in that involved the dependents, persons accompanying the armed forces except for this fact that here a noncapital rather than the capital offense is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.871" offset="619416">And the problem here is whether this difference, this distinction should make for a difference in the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.608" offset="646374">The problem can really be broken down in two questions first, where the capital and noncapital distinction can be relevant at all for jurisdictional purposes, and secondly, if it can be relevant whether it should be decisive to the -- to the outcome of the case, in other words, whether the result here should be different in the result that was reached in Covert.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.125" offset="724428">On the first issue, it's argued by the appellee that jurisdiction is a matter of fixed content which cannot, in any event, be varied depending on the gravity of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.890" offset="767478">Well, that may well be true as a general matter, although it isn't entirely in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.845" offset="787331">For example, the military for many years from 1863 to 1916 had jurisdiction over common law offenses other than capital offenses, did not -- did not have jurisdiction over capital offenses even the time of war until 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.782" offset="851069">It certainly is true in this situation and that is for these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.294" offset="885133">The problem of course here is a constitutional one.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.776" offset="899030">Now, the capital and noncapital distinction has relevance and has been held by the Court to have relevance in other types of constitutional cases and I'm specifically I'm referring to due process cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.504" offset="949917">In our view, the problem that is here involved is essentially similar to a due process type of problem, and the techniques and the approach of the due process determination should be used and this arises essentially out of the fact that the offense was committed overseas outside of the jurisdiction of the United States proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.612" offset="1038420">Now, we recognize that In re Ross and the Insular Cases which this Court discussed at length both in the first Covert opinion and in the second Covert case, cannot be read to put the proposition that the Constitution cannot in any event have any application abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.049" offset="1124101">But I think those cases do stand for the proposition that the circumstances of a particular case, the practicalities and the necessities do have relevance in determining whether any particular power, any particular provision does apply when the problem arises outside of the United States proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.788" offset="1215112">For example, in the Ross case itself it was deemed relevant that the -- it was -- it appeared necessary for the protection of Americans of Counselor Courts be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.055" offset="1260147">I'm not saying at the Ross case without more just because this was held to be true in the Ross case that therefore we could establish Counselor Courts or similar type of Courts in this situation, but it does stand for the proposition and -- as far as we can determine and has not been overruled, it does stand for the proposition that in particular circumstances, various factors such as practicalities and necessities do have a bearing on the scope and the breadth of various constitutional provisions and policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.761" offset="1406955">The same would be true of the Insular Cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.173" offset="1416673">The Court there held in these various cases that -- that, for example, jury trials need not be provided in Criminal Cases in the Philippines or in Hawaii and Puerto Rico and so on because it was said that the traditions and institutions in those territories didn't lend themselves to that type of procedural device.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.303" offset="1505176">And again, while we're not arguing if this has to be carried over as such into these cases, it does show that the approach is essentially one of determining each situation on its particular facts and on the circumstances as they arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.014" offset="1583961">So, the basic conclusion that can be drawn from those decisions is that -- that practical matters, circumstances of the era, circumstances of -- of the -- the power that can be exercised properly in the particular -- in the particular country at a particular time, do have relevance to the scope of -- of constitutional powers and constitutional provisions and guarantees generally abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.596" offset="1698377">Now, that's true generally and then I suppose assuming that the conditions here are present for the same -- in the same way that -- that would come to the conclusion would it be relevant in this situation as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.653" offset="1762534">Now, the -- that -- that type of an issue as to whether the practicalities of the situation demand and the circumstances at least are relevant to determining the scope of powers is best and can really only be determined and -- and decided by a due process type of approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.306" offset="1849156">On the one hand, the interests of the various parties have to be considered, on the other hand, the practicalities and necessities of the situation and that type of an approach, traditionally, the capital, noncapital distinction has been irrelevant factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.039" offset="1920104">I might say too that the same conclusion can be reached irrespective really of Ross or the Insular Cases simply on the -- on the problem of the content of Clause 14 itself, the clause which permits Congress to provide for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.976" offset="1999830">As was indicated, as -- as we quote in our brief from Alexander Hamilton from The Federalist, he had the view that the circumstances and necessities are relevant to the -- to the determination of the scope of this Clause 14 power.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.732" offset="2062838">Now, we don't mean to say that the Clause 14 power can be expanded at will, at the expense as it's suggested by our opponents at the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, but we do suggest that the -- the circumstances are appropriate in any -- in any given case to determine how far the power extends.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.075" offset="2148206">For example, as we read the history, the power does extend -- did extend in frontier type situations where there were no civil courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.717" offset="2190838">The power does extend and did extend in war time for civilians as -- as some of the cases hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.000" offset="2219990">So, it -- it seems to us that if those types of considerations can give content to the power and have given content to the power, then in this situation too, these -- these same considerations maybe considered and maybe relevant to determine what the content of the power is.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.723" offset="2306821">We contend of course that in a -- in a – certainly in the general way, the situation we have here overseas is analogous to the types of situations that were confronted by the British Parliament when the -- the Articles of War 1765 were passed when -- when they were talking about giving Court Martial Jurisdiction over persons who were in places where the -- where our civil judicature as it is said in the -- in the article is absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.211" offset="2436807">He -- our the civil judicature is absent as the same way as it was in Gibraltar or in Annapolis in -- at time when those articles were first enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.164" offset="2488633">Now, assuming that it is capital, noncapital, distinction can be relevant across the problem still is whether the -- whether that distinction should have a decisive impact on the case so as to cause a result that's different from that was reached in Covert and we think that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.518" offset="2561985">It has that impact and does have that significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.265" offset="2577032">In two respects, one that might be called that has negative and the other positive and negative aspect is simply the fact that here, the very important consideration that -- that was so much discussed in the Covert opinions and concurring opinions, certainly, that life was at stake and that the -- the death was irrevocable.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.128" offset="2676506">That factor is simply absent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.347" offset="2685388">That type of the factor which many times in the past has led the Court to make a sharp distinction between one type of process that may -- maybe that do appropriate in one type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.344" offset="2741290">It has led the Court to hold that the same type of process need not be given, where noncapital cases involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.919" offset="2775667">But beyond that merely negative factor of the absence of the -- of the capital nature of the case, there is also a positive factor and that has to do with the alternatives that are available to the exercise of Court Martial Jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.918" offset="2843585">Briefly, it's our view that the only real alternative to the exercise of Court Martial Jurisdiction is also attractive and palatable and desirable from the overall American interest not only of the American government but also of this -- of the persons involved themselves is a trial in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.637" offset="2926446">And that I think was the rationale in which the decision -- the ultimate decision in Convert can be explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.712" offset="2954762">In other words, it was possible to bring back to transport the few persons involved in capital cases back to this country for a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.347" offset="3001365">The -- It warranted and -- and physically and practically possible, but I think it's not realistic or practical to expect the same kind of approach in the many noncapital cases that are committed at all times overseas by the -- almost half a million persons who make up this contingent that these cases are concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.473" offset="3113796">For -- for these minor offenses, it would simply not be one that the said in motion, the elaborate apparatus that would be necessary to bring about a trial in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.540" offset="3158100">For example, the problem of witnesses alone would be a -- a staggering problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.639" offset="3186521">The -- some of the witnesses might be local police officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.439" offset="3201672">You would bring them back to the United States and they might have to wait for a considerable period of time until the trial could be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.422" offset="3229675">It would disrupt the operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.977" offset="3235840">They probably would not -- wouldn't -- wouldn't want to, wouldn't feel like abandoning their duties in their respective countries to come here to participate in those trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.975" offset="3275860">Other persons -- other witnesses might be co-conspirators or other persons who would be -- might be reluctant to come here.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.998" offset="3307938">Now, I say that in capital cases, it would be warranted to make the specialized effort that would be necessary to overcome all those difficulties, but I don't think that this kind -- some kind of an effort either can be made or would be warranted in every type of minor or -- or noncapital offense that might be committed by anyone, anywhere in the world that would be covered by this article.</text>

            <text syncTime="1996.264" offset="7985006">And so, I will address myself simply to the narrow question of whether this case should be decided differently because Mrs. Dial was charged with a noncapital offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2011.297" offset="8045087">Well, the Board of Review in this case, page 22 of the record, the Board of Review composed of three army officers gave this answer, “We conclude that the necessity for military jurisdiction over dependents charged with noncapital offenses is sufficient to overcome the requirements of Article III in the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.088" offset="8148323">Well, that's a very simple method of amending the Constitution by the sword, but I will give this gentleman a credit for being forthright, for being candid, for not shading the facts and for not omitting anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="2110.139" offset="8440477">Now, it is said there is no acceptable or practical alternative to deal with dependents charged with noncapital offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.861" offset="8479347">The fact of the matter is that Article 7 of the NATO Agreement specifically concedes primary jurisdiction to the foreign country, the host country, over all offenses committed by dependents, primary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.742" offset="8546952">Now, there is therefore a solid, practical, and acceptable alternative arrived at by solemn international agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.611" offset="8586344">What about Berlin or Mrs. Cheaps also charged originally with unpremeditated murder as was Mrs. Dial?</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.523" offset="8618005">She brought the habeas -- habeas corpus here and she was turned over to the Germans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.084" offset="8636291">And I think that the new German agreement which we mentioned will make the NATO arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.231" offset="8656875">Now, on the impact of Article VII of NATO, a noncapital crime is committed by dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.209" offset="8688744">Your Honors will not be confused by any discussion in the government's brief because they don't mention it in their brief at chief and they don't deny it in their reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.645" offset="8730540">Let me address myself to this capital, noncapital distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.464" offset="8749767">It's our position that with one narrow war time objection, which I'll come to in a great length in just a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.197" offset="8780696">With one narrow war time exception, military jurisdiction rest upon military stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.001" offset="8811938">Now, there are a whole lot of decisions here that when someone becomes a member of an armed force, he assumes new rights, he assumes new obligations, new liabilities, obligations and liabilities, so comprehensive in their totality as to constitute a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.851" offset="8887380">Now, that must mean something and only about 10 years ago, this Court had occasion to refer to the vast gulf between the civil and the military jurisdiction and it is a vast gulf because each rests on a separate head of power, one on Article III, the other on Clause 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.000" offset="8960000">And I say that that isn't a due process question at all. Due process considerations are eminently proper, where the question concerns the exercise, the mode of exercise of an admitted power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.135" offset="9016529">But due process has nothing to do with the question whether the power exists at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.842" offset="9039308">And we are speaking now of constitutional power and not of legislative judgment whether or not particular capital offenses should be triable by a Court Martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.584" offset="9082253">Now, what is the exception to the rule of states?</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.215" offset="9096777">It is the war time exception of jurisdiction over persons in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.979" offset="9123840">That is a war time jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.824" offset="9139200">It rests on the war power and there is all the difference in the world between peace and war in this connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.993" offset="9175876">In time of field in war -- in war, in time of field is where military operations are in progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.440" offset="9205760">War may be a declared war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.970" offset="9215791">It may be an actual, undeclared war such as the hostilities with the Indians or the hostilities in Korea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.945" offset="9243690">As long as there is shooting it's in the field, and war is a fact and not a legal condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.758" offset="9270962">Now, the very words of the old camp-follower article, can in the field where words that imply a condition of hostilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.966" offset="9311817">As the Judge Advocate General said, strictly speaking, “There's no such thing as a camp-follower in time of peace because if it's peaceful, you don't have a camp.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.933" offset="9351732">And it is not a basis for overseas military jurisdiction in time of peace that there happen to be no domestic civilian courts around.</text>

            <text syncTime="2403.169" offset="9612643">Now, let us go -- let us go for a minute on the "in the field” jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.622" offset="9646393">The government has quoted a passage -- rather lengthy passage from Samuel, historical account of the law of military.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.603" offset="9682338">That was quoted two years ago, it is cited I think Mr. Justice Harlan on the footnote in Your Honor's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.898" offset="9711491">Now, what it isn't quoted is the introductory paragraph from 691 which says this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.395" offset="9741479">“The second description of persons to which the article refers, namely settlers and retainers of the camp and persons serving with the king's armies in the field, though they should not be enlisted soldiers, are subject to military orders not by the letter of the Mutiny Act but by the usage and customs of war.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.536" offset="9830087">In other words, it is in exercise of the war power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.448" offset="9845760">Now, I brushed off when I dealt with the Samuel quotation, I brushed that off, “Oh that's in the field” and I went on to digging into our own history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.176" offset="9884630">But thanks to Mr. Kehoe who represents the petitioner in 1958 and it wasn't prepared to brush the matter off, he looked in to Samuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.648" offset="9930501">He got the book and he finds that after the section quoted by the government, there are three instances of trials, some brutal punishments, one of a thousand lashes, all of these three instances from the Peninsular War in Spain in the British Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.023" offset="10000091">And then, this paragraph on page 697, this article so far as it respects settlers and retainers and persons serving the armies and actual service and in the field does not attach to the same persons in camp Toemans or in barracks at home or in similar establishments which are of a permanent and domestic nature abroad where the ordinary laws have their force and are administered through the medium of the Civil Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.532" offset="10130077">In other words, even in the British service, this jurisdiction wouldn't be exercised where there was any kind of a civil court around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.288" offset="10169051">And in all of these three instances -- the four cases here, there were foreign civil courts functioning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2584.772" offset="10339056">I think the reason given was that they were giving up the consular courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.539" offset="10354103">But of course, the British don't have Clause 14 to contend with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.027" offset="10368104">They would have decided Reid v. Covert differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.750" offset="10378971">They would have decided the Toth case differently and they would have decided the Hirschberg case differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.703" offset="10402795">They don't have this problem at all but they did say way back that if there is any kind of civil court functioning, this war time jurisdiction won't be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.587" offset="10450338">Now, I think if your -- if, Your Honors look at the definitions of “in the field”, the opinions of the Judge Advocate General, and the Attorney General that stressed the limits of military jurisdiction, Your Honors will find that this is something sought to be brushed aside by the government as though it were a personal aberration of Colonel Wilkins and yet, these distinctions appear in four published editions of the digest of opinions of the Judge Advocate General, and I think this would be a good case to apply the doctrine which is expressed in opinions of this Court that the opinions of the Judge Advocate General on questions of military law are entitled to some respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.106" offset="10632359">And the Attorney General also held that this jurisdiction could only be exercised in time of war in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.829" offset="10671229">And in that connection, I must confess to an error in my -- in the Singleton brief, I accredited to Attorney General Devens the opinion in 14 of 22 which defines “in the field”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.194" offset="10728699">That was Attorney General Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.282" offset="10737058">Attorney General Devens wrote the opinions in 16 up, which says, “You can't try civilians except in time of war or in the field.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.940" offset="10783660">Now, except for this settled exception which rests on the war power, I think it's plain from the cases and the discussions that the camp, the military jurisdiction without military states and I will now proceed to set forth additional grounds where the capital, noncapital distinction is untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.707" offset="10886792">First, you cannot get it out of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.614" offset="10898390">The only place where the Constitution mentions capital offenses is in the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.072" offset="10920229">And there, the grouping is not capital versus noncapital, but capital and other infamous crimes on the one hand and all others on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.928" offset="10955651">These -- all of these cases would be infamous in the constitutional sense had they been tried in the Civil Courts and second, even that distinction by -- by the terms -- by the next Clause of the Fifth Amendment is not applicable to military cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.034" offset="11024091">Second, you cannot get the capital, noncapital distinction out of the -- out of Clause 14.</text>

            <text syncTime="2858.663" offset="11434632">And the fact -- the historical fact is that people weren't willing to trust this new government unless some boundary were drawn.</text>

            <text syncTime="2963.035" offset="11852069">Now, another capital, noncapital distinction historically, well, historically, when 1787 most -- many, many military offenses were capital that the -- the most important ones were capital and the only noncapital, capital distinction that you'll find is on records of Courts of inquiry and depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.099" offset="11948304">You couldn't use those in capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.608" offset="11962410">Under the older jurisdictional test of the scope of -- of the review of judgments of conviction by Court Martial, you look to was the Court properly appointed, did it have jurisdiction of the person, did it have jurisdiction of the subject matter, did it exceed the permissible sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3010.152" offset="12040568">But the capital, noncapital distinction would make jurisdiction of the person depend on subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.547" offset="12078184">And finally, it is untenable in the context of military law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.270" offset="12105038">The first place, Reid v. Covert when it reached the Civil Courts was a noncapital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.374" offset="12133460">It was a noncapital case when she petitioned for habeas corpus because she was to be held for rehearing which couldn't have adjudged the capital sense and that's why the prosecution is going to use the deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.120" offset="12180480">In the second place, Article 118, the homicide article has four branches of homicide one, unpremeditated murder -- premeditated two, unpremeditated; three, reckless murder, the one disregard and fourth, felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.047" offset="12244114">Well now, how can we say that you can try for Article I -- you can't for Clauses 1 and 4 but you can for 2 and 3?</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.515" offset="12286015">It's even more confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.092" offset="12300330">Among the offenses which constitute felony murder, this is 118(4) is someone engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of burglary and four other offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.273" offset="12349022">Now, burglary is denounced by Article 129 of the Code, housebreaking, which doesn't figure in felony murder, is denounced by 130.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.388" offset="12397505">The manual construing and explaining the burglary article says that a tent cannot be the subject of burglary, but that out houses in an inhabitant area can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.796" offset="12447138">In other words, if you are attempting to commit -- enter -- if you kill a person who is sleeping in a tent while you're burglarizing the tent or you want to steal something from it, it is a noncapital offense but it is – and it's a capital offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.517" offset="12522057">Now, I say it's not only ridiculous to make the very constitutional power to try at all depend on this kind of distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.246" offset="12816927">I have phrased in the brief the development of the extension of military jurisdiction for military persons in respect of civil offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.177" offset="12856633">There were certain offenses in time of war in 1863.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.446" offset="12877740">The civil felonies were not specifically made punishable in time of peace until 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.211" offset="12904803">And in the -- in an Ex Parte Mason, 105 U.S, the trial of the -- by Court Martial of the soldier who shot at Guiteau, President Garfield's assassin, he was charged under the general article as convict attending to the prejudice of good order in military discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.878" offset="12991425">In the Grafton case in the 206 U.S., homicide by assassin, he was tried by the Court Martial under the general article because manslaughter was not specifically an offense in time of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.569" offset="13042207">But what I'm saying is that military jurisdiction in those instances is a matter of legislative judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.822" offset="13075226">There's no question of the power of Congress to make punishable by Court Martial all capital offenses committed by persons in uniform, although it's never yet may imprison punishable under the Articles of War.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.223" offset="13132800">But what we're dealing here -- with here is constitutional power and I say when you go into the context of military law, you cannot find that capital, noncapital distinction as a question of, “Can we try this person at all?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.163" offset="13192568">And incidentally, it's interesting and perhaps amusing that the government's position on the capital, noncapital distinction is very different in this case than it is in the Grisham case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.582" offset="13250247">Now, here is a dependent woman charged of a noncapital case and the government says, “Oh, this is a tremendous distinction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.648" offset="13286504">And then, we have Grisham who is a civilian employee charged with a capital offense and the government says, “Oh well, it's no -- no distinction at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.805" offset="13323180">The same business, he's a civilian employee and not a dependent and therefore it's not like Covert.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.751" offset="13354945">But at any rate, the point I want to make is that when you are dealing here with the narrow question of civilian dependents, I don't think you will find any basis in history or practice for their trial by Court Martial in time of peace, after all, two incidents, two incidents in a 172 years and both of them in manuscript, one in the archives and the other at the west point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.054" offset="13464137">Now, as to the practical necessities, I've mentioned Article VII, I've mentioned the fact that they turned this mischief charged with the same offense over to the Germans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.486" offset="13501858">I might say that they have acquiesced and that the government acquiesced in the number of earlier cases holding that there was no jurisdiction and I think I will mention the Girard case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.486" offset="13549923">In the Girard case, the government came here and obtained a decision that it had power to turn Girard over to the Japanese.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.216" offset="13588793">Now, of course it did, no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.692" offset="13602691">Well now, if it was a -- a matter of national honor to turn Girard over to the Japanese, why couldn't these four people have been tried by the local court?</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.119" offset="13644382">Why couldn't Guagliardo have been tried by the Moroccan court?</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.343" offset="13657339">He was in a Moroccan jail for sometime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.268" offset="13673012">Why couldn't Mrs. Dial have been tried by a German Court just as well as Mrs. Cheaps?</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.190" offset="13696731">Why couldn't Wilson in the next case as -- which I'll come to -- been turned over to the Germans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.541" offset="13722122">And as for Grisham, he killed his -- he killed his wife on French soil, he is the self-made widower.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.585" offset="13750335">He killed his wife on French soil, he was held in the custody of the French police for two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.638" offset="13778547">Why wasn't it an acceptable alternative to turn Grisham over to the French when his only connection with the Army was that he was a civilian employee from the National -- from the Nashville Engineer District to his on six months temporary duty at Orleans, France.</text>

            <text syncTime="3498.481" offset="13993900">And -- and as Mr. Shakett pointed out, we have given up our consular jurisdiction in Morocco because we felt that it was appropriate to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.697" offset="14034756">And that was the last outpost of consular jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.379" offset="14049489">In other words, we proceed on the basis that all of these people are civilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.569" offset="14070178">We held on the extra territoriality in China for a long time saying we can't trust the Chinese Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.937" offset="14095673">We gave it up in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.703" offset="14102779">We've given it up everywhere so that I would say that as long as we permit American civilians to travel to those countries on American passports where they will be subject to the jurisdiction of the local courts, we can't say that it is an unacceptable alternative to turn over particular classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.775" offset="14203089">So, the conclusion I arrive at is that Reid v. Covert governs this case that the District Judge was right in so holding and that his judgment freeing Mrs. Dial from custody should be affirmed.</text>
