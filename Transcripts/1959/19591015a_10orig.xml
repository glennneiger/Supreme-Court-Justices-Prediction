            <label>Mr. Spessard L. Holland</label>
            <text syncTime="20.478" offset="185240">Mr. Justice Black and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.822" offset="206660">In my brief argument of yesterday, I've gotten to the point where I covered that part of the record showing that a convention was held at Tallahassee pursuant to the Reconstruction Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.638" offset="265906">Beginning in January of 1868 ending with the signature of a new Constitution on February 25th which then was submitted to the people who adopted it in an election on May 4th, 5th and, 6th whereupon the new Constitution was certified to the President on May 27th.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.322" offset="368619">The action of Congress was June 25th, 1868 by which the new Constitution of Florida along with the new Constitutions of the five other Act -- States covered in that Act were acted upon by Congress, and as we contend, were approved by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.813" offset="454614">It's admitted by the Government that Article 1, the boundary article of that constitution, covered the submerged lands off of the mainland of the West Coast to Florida extending into the Gulf, a distance of three marine leagues, and there's no argument there.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.450" offset="541132">The argument is as to whether Congress approved that part of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.393" offset="568926">Now, Mr. President -- Mr. Justice Black, it seems to me that it's appropriate to go to the facts insofar as they're disclosed by the record and I shall attempt to do so briefly in the time that is allowed to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.067" offset="647607">The President furnished to Congress on its request the two documents, miscellaneous document 114 and miscellaneous document 297 of the Second Session of the 48th Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.579" offset="709674">First of those covered simply the Convention Constitution, the one that was actually adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.422" offset="741021">The other, at the special request of the Congress, covered all three of the Constitutions which were considered by the Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.990" offset="779368">And one of which incidentally, was claimed by the Chairman of the Rock Convention which met briefly in Tallahassee following the departure of the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.853" offset="830777">It was claimed by that Convention to have been adopted, though that particular aversion was not submitted to the people.</text>

            <label>Mr. Spessard L. Holland</label>
            <text syncTime="198.592" offset="897755">The interesting fact about those three different constitutions, one of which was adopted, the other two of which were not, is that all of them had an Article 1, boundary article.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.924" offset="959091">All of them showed the same desire of the framers of the Convention and the people of Florida to extend their boundaries but all of them had a different -- each of them had a different provision from the others relative to the distance in the Gulf of Mexico off the mainland of Florida, showing rather conclusive to the Congress when that document was furnished that here had been a matter of real controversy in the constitutional convention.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="246.860" offset="1090853">Where do we find those documents?</text>

            <label>Mr. Spessard L. Holland</label>
            <text syncTime="248.695" offset="1098167">They're found on Florida briefs at the pages 18 to 27 and I had not intended to go into them in detail because of the limit of time and because I am sure the Court has considered and will continue to consider this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.514" offset="1173400">But I wanted to call attention to the fact that any argument that the Congress did not understand that the boundary represented a change and that the boundary had been a matter of very great controversy in the Convention is clearly set aside when we consider these three different versions, which were submitted by the President of the United States in a congressional document considered by the members of both Houses in their hands and on their desks when this debate took place.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="305.819" stopTime="310.602">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="305.819" offset="1326686">Does any of those drafts include the original six-league claims?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="spessard_l_holland" startTime="310.602" stopTime="577.719">
            <label>Mr. Spessard L. Holland</label>
            <text syncTime="310.602" offset="1345808">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.331" offset="1348733">The one draft that followed the Constitution of 1865 which I referred to you yesterday and uncovered islands within five leagues, another covered a limit at five leagues, and the one submitted and ratified by the people covered a limit at three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.398" offset="1436923">And I think that's important not to only showing the controversial nature of this subject in such a way that -- I am advised by my assistant that that reference should have been to the appendix of the Florida brief rather than to the principal portion, pages 18, 27 of the appendix of the Florida brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.767" offset="1530441">I think that it's important not only to show that the Congress was bound to know about this controversy, bound to know about the difference of opinion on the boundary provisions and the desire of the Convention to claim what it could properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.550" offset="1597524">But I think it's also extremely important because the -- the method of delineating that boundary which was chosen by the Convention and which was submitted to the people and ratified by the people and then submitted to Congress and passed upon there, is the limit three leagues which had already been enacted into the foreign policy of our nation in the Texas matter, because it's so evident that somebody there must have known about that situation and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.574" offset="1745690">This is only an argument on the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.999" offset="1755408">I have already stated to the Court that the records except as to the journal of the Convention are a very sketchy and I think the confusion at those times easily explains that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.284" offset="1812459">So that how could Congress have missed the fact that here was a three-league boundary being submitted after controversy and here was a boundary of which comported where the Act of United States has ratified already by the Senate of the United States in approving the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo because it's quite evident that there were persons there who wanted to go farther than the three-league limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.837" offset="1934712">Incidentally, Mr. Seward, the Secretary of State who had had some thought in the border -- in the boundary controversy prior to that time, was the Secretary of State at this time, was seating right here as adviser to the President and to the Congress and that there was no evidence of any objection from his part, nor for that matter is there any evidence or any objection on the part of any member of either the House or the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.640" offset="2049964">Now, we all know that Congress and particularly that Congress well knew the importance of boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.160" offset="2075982">This same Congress on March 1, 1867, had admitted Nebraska to statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.047" offset="2103568">This same Congress is bound to have known the constitutional provision in Article 4, Paragraph (3), providing for the admission of new states and prohibiting the inclusion of parts of any other States without the consent of those States.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.870" offset="2170859">We wonder, Mr. Justice and Your Honor -- Your Honors, whether Congress can be held to have been unconcerned at this stage about the possibility of conflicting boundaries, because they well knew that they were admitting to a representation and were acting upon the constitutions of six States, five of which were contiguous one to the other, and all of which were contagious to other States which were in the same situation that is operating under the Reconstruction Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.580" offset="2301680">And they must have well known that the boundary question was one of the important and it's impossible for me to conceive that they, with the recent recollection of the admission of Nebraska and with full knowledge that in Enabling Act, admitting states, the principal part, as a matter of fact, except the little brief formula for the admission, is the delineation of the boundary of the States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1951.365" offset="7908812">My next point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.120" offset="7911842">I want to make it only briefly is that Florida proceeded to assume jurisdiction and make use of this Submerged Land in the gulf and there's many, many indications of that not only in our statutes to which I shall not refer, but particularly to references in three federal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.305" offset="7996583">All appearing in the briefs, the case of Cunningham against Skiriotes at page 53 of the Florida brief, the case of Pope against Blanton which was a three-judge federal court, in the District Court of Florida and the case of Skiriotes against Florida in this Court where the opinion written by Mr. Chief Justice Hughes mentions the controversy but found the easier ground to decide it than to -- at that time and upon the evidence then submitted, decide where the boundary laid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.283" offset="8148511">And all of those cases though show affirmative that the State of Florida in the exercise of its own jurisdiction and sovereignty, they had statutes applying out to the three-league line and these cases all arose outside of the three-mile line and between at the time the three-league line as shown in the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.195" offset="8236178">And that purpose for that particular jurisdiction shown in those three cases was the regulation of the sponge industry which is an important industry of the West Coast of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.690" offset="8286124">I shall not labor that point but all this cases showed clearly that Florida exercised the jurisdiction and used it and claimed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.859" offset="8322800">Now, when it came to this case and I again will have to proceed more rapidly than I have expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.928" offset="8351117">The Congress proceeded very carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.420" offset="8361044">It heard the testimony of the three federal executives who are most involved in this except the President and they received a letter from him, which has already been mentioned by another in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.840" offset="8422693">But Mr. Secretary McKay of the Interior Department testified his testimony of page 30 of Florida brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.268" offset="8452472">Mr. Attorney General Brownell at page 957 of the Senate Hearings and in the Texas brief also, both of them affirmatively stating that as to the case of Florida, their boundary was out three leagues in the gulf off of the mainland coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.679" offset="8530108">And then we call the Department of State -- the Senate called the Department of State and Mr. Tate, Assistant Solicitor but testifying for the department, testified to a great caution and his testimony will be found in the Senate Hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.968" offset="8599280">But I'll refer to three places, page 1053, page 1078, page 1086 because I cannot at this time read those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.296" offset="8636583">But the substance of it was, first, that he recognized the fact that in the case of Florida and one other state, Texas, there was precedent for the carrying out of the boundaries to three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.628" offset="8681932">And he also testified, and this is the matter which I want to call especially to the attention of the Court that in this troublous case that confronted him, it could by settled without trespassing upon the foreign policy of the United States by having the Act refer only to the development and production of the seabed and not to the extension of the territorial waters out there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2205.435" offset="8925080">And the letter from Mr. Secretary Dulles signed for him by Assistant Secretary Morton makes that same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.359" offset="8960815">And in pursuance of that point, as the records here will show, the Senate Committee proceeded to amend the Act so as to make it in the alternative so that very clearly, it would cover only, might be construed to cover only the assignment of the rights of development in the seabed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.260" offset="9040436">The letter from Mr. Dulles is found on page 1088 on the -- in the record of the hearings of the Senate and -- Senate or House -- Senate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2265.582" offset="9165720">Those purposes as the Court will find were the purposes of operation of the submerged lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.285" offset="9192469">And incidentally, the Committee immediately met -- immediately met that situation by producing from the bill which had been filed as drafted by 44 Attorneys General producing various changes and amendments which may -- would make it clear that this Act could be construed as I've indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.133" offset="9291943">The Court will find on page 5 of the Senate report, the sentence which makes that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.946" offset="9319111">The measure also provides that in addition to title and ownership but distinct from them, the States shall have the right and power to manage or administer, at least develop and use such lands and natural resources in accordance at the time of the Senate Joint Resolution 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.228" offset="9384312">And whatever rights the federal government may have in such management and administration or established in and assign to the States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2505.784" offset="10126503">He said, "There is no question but that the Holland Bill simply gives to the States the lands within their original boundaries within their territorial waters at the time they entered the Union".</text>

            <text syncTime="3137.642" offset="12653902">Well, the Solicitor General has already explained our views about the effect to be given to a statement including all islands within a certain distance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3161.534" offset="12749511">And we think on the contrary, the States are trying to read something out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.600" offset="12765811">If it had simply said extending into the gulf six leagues, then certainly, they would be in the right as to what meaning of that phrase was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.783" offset="12802487">But when it says -- the addition of the word “islands” does not necessarily add to the scope of the description I think it restricts it including all islands within six leagues.</text>
