            <text syncTime="243.272" offset="1076433">Now, as I've said, Section 8 (b) (7) makes it illegal to picket, to force or require recognition of the employers to join in three situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.669" offset="1206000">But if the last section, Section 8 (b) (7) (C) I believe it is, which says that a -- when --where either of these two situations that I've just described obtains -- obtains, that the union may not picket for a period to exceed 30 days unless within those 30 days, there is a representation petition has been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.310" offset="1276635">Now, con -- it -- it is possible that under that section, picketing may go on for 30 days or more whether it's there's a representation petition has been filed, but there maybe situations where the special circumstances of the situation may make it desirable and appropriate for the purpose of effectuating the statutory policies to move against picketing --</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.807" offset="6534562">This State strikes and picketing which is equated with strikes by this Court in the Rice Milling case and specifically by other circuits under 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.829" offset="6578657">It states that picketing or strikes can be proscribed only if it specifically provided for another sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.854" offset="6614810">Section 8 (b) (1) (A) certainly does not by its terms specifically proscribe any concerted activity such as those for instance Section 8 (b) (4) which can be said to be a specific prohibition of picketing or striking, because it deals specifically with striking and picketing as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.455" offset="6693177">The Section merely states in a general way that it's an unfair practice to restrain or coerce -- restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of rights set forth in Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.800" offset="6742601">Now, for nine solid years, the Board held that the reach and the scope of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) was not to interdict or -- or condemn within the phrase coerce any aspects of peaceful striking or picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.123" offset="6827865">Perry-Norville, the NMUK decided before Perry-Norville and six cases decided after that time between the time of that first decision and now, all held specifically that regardless of how illegal the object might be, the object of union's activities to get a closed shop for instance although a closed shop was proscribed by the Act or other directly admittedly illegal objectives, nevertheless, picketing to secure those objectives could not be indicted or proscribed under Section 8 (b) (1) (A) because peaceful picketing could not be deemed and was never thought to be included within the term coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.546" offset="6989511">Now, for the first time, the Board argues -- argues flatly that because picketing has -- which we all admit, picketing has the effect of attempting to reach an employer economically and the Board then says that that may reach the employees indirectly in their economic position that the employer loses business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.351" offset="7072789">They might suffer -- in their employment conditions that by that indirect means, there has been a accomplished a coercion within the meaning of the term coerce as set forth in Section 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>

            <text syncTime="1776.883" offset="7210924">A readymade and a very traditional objective of union -- unions generally is reached by attempt by minority unions to achieve recognition and indeed, a contract with unorganized employers namely, extending the scope of organization beyond the single shop or extending the scope of organizations -- of organizations and try to bargaining to reach all the shops within an industry or within an area as a means of eliminating the competition from the -- the wage -- capital -- wage competition from the unorganized shops.</text>

            <text syncTime="2703.729" offset="10918327">Perhaps, we have to consider all of these federal laws in the labor field of the comprehensive code to see this what -- how the Congress considers and regards the various rights that are asserted from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.111" offset="10975796">As I indicated in an answer to a question from Mr. Justice Whittaker, it is traditionally since the beginning of trade union history than the customer practice of unions to seek to extend organization beyond the single shot.</text>

            <text syncTime="2744.792" offset="11082585">That principle has been upheld by this Court in the American Steel Foundries case Chief Justice when Mr. Taft was Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.892" offset="11138905">In the Apex case, Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice Roberts both dealing with Antitrust, Sherman Act and Clayton Act attempts to -- to prevent unions from picketing by -- in -- in -- the minority situations that we have here and the Court -- this Court expressed its understanding of the principle of attempting to spread organization by minority picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.523" offset="11253426">In a Swing case, this Court expressed similar views in connection by the free speech considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.617" offset="11289788">The Norris-LaGuardia Act, Section 104 and Section 113 (e) specifically protects minority picketing for recognition from the injunction process at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.818" offset="11350601">And in this connection, we refer the Court to the Fur Workers case, we have it cited in our brief, affirmed here where there was minority picketing and on that premise alone, an injunction was sought and no minority picketing for recognition and the Court denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.333" offset="11424684">And then in these same Sections to the Norris-LaGuardia Act which protected as against injunctions, the past picketing we had -- we had here before the 1959 amendments were carried on to the both the Wagner Act and to the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.587" offset="11897710">That depends on whether coercion, the term coercion as used in 8 (b) (1) (A) can be said or read to include peaceful picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.680" offset="11938043">Up to this case, it never has been -- Congress never -- up until 1959, never considered peaceful picketing as being coercive or admittedly has -- it brings economic pressure on employer and then maybe on employees and the Board for nine solid years specifically held that picketing cannot -- peaceful picketing cannot be held to the coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.029" offset="12043473">That all of it was embraced within the term “coercion” was physical violence, mass picketing, beating, things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.809" offset="12074611">And the legislative history is replete -- is very illuminating on that aspect also Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3007.240" offset="12132289">I argue this Your Honor that within the meaning of the term “coerced” as used in Section 8 (b) (1) (A) that takes violence in fact or threat of violence in the fact or some means of direct retaliation against an employer -- against union -- against nonunion people or employees something other and in addition and involving some more element of intimidation than peaceful picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.583" offset="12249736">Peaceful picketing has never in the long history of litigation on this subject and been considered per se coercive and that in the intimidatory sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.561" offset="12289651">It has been recognized as having consequences, economic consequences in bringing pressures, yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3061.887" offset="12350882">That is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.488" offset="12357360">But if -- again, 8 (b) (1) (A) was not concerned with purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.300" offset="12372616">It was concerned with means, not purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.228" offset="12384319">It was concern primarily with - -with means of interference and purposes of strikes and so on were directly on 8 (b) (4) where objectives were spelled out as being unlawful and where striking was spelled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.751" offset="12446386">Picketing was spelled out as being dealt with unlike the situation on Section 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.835" offset="12490689">Now, the -- the only reason I am reciting all this Norris-LaGuardia Act in the history and to carry on of those protection during the Wagner Act and Taft-Hartley is to show that Congress did consider minority picketing a protected activity and certainly, at the very least, if it up until that time, up to the time of Taft-Hartley, the very least it would've done if it didn't want to consider protected anymore would be to out -- outlaw it specifically and that it did not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.600" offset="12605733">And it did not do that until 1959 when it did it at great length in Section 8 (b) (7).</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.920" offset="12655052">There are two other factors in conclusion which would acquire any court to go slow and broadly extending 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.010" offset="12699460">In addition to Section 13, we had Section 8 (C) of the Act which protects the right of peaceful picketing under the Act unless specifically proscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.880" offset="12746898">Again picketing which is an aspect to free speech is not specifically proscribed under Section 8 (b) (1) (A) and finally, we have the overall considerations stressed so strongly by this Court in the Hot Cargo case that the (Inaudible) American Iron cases which is that since Taft-Hartley is the product of better compromise, better argument in which strongly contending forces were pressing for their various positions, the Court should go extremely slow and should be extremely reluctant to extend the scope of the Act merely by construction and were not clearly commanded by expressed language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.289" offset="12932577">We have no such express language in Section 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>
