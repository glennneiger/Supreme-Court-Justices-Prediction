            <text syncTime="139.786" offset="662549">Now, as a matter of fact, this particular employee was -- the evidence shows, was engaged virtually exclusively in the fabricating of the phenolic parts.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.969" offset="759202">Is it true that the term “establishment” is the crucial thing here, that one owner might have, even under one roof, several establishments, activities in one be covered and in the other not covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="181.142" stopTime="412.809">
            <label>Ms. Bessie Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="181.142" offset="827956">It could be that if these two businesses were segregable with different employees, we would recognize them as separate establishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.715" offset="870275">Of course, this Court has already decided that there must be a physical establishment that it's the single physical establishment and not the enterprise as a whole that determines whether the exemption applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.105" offset="927744">When you have the mix, as you have them here, the question depends upon whether they are segregable.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.853" offset="954807">Now, if, in this case, they have been segregable, the exemption might apply to the retail part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.931" offset="991065">As a matter of fact, the -- there was no evident here even that the custom furniture business was retail but assuming it was retail and for the purposes of this case, I think we can assume that it was, although there -- there's evidence here that might indicate it was not -- even that part of the business might not have been a retail establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.063" offset="1067656">But what the Court did here was to say that we -- we look at this business and from our general feeling about it, we think this is basic -- the basic nature of interior decorating as retail and the fact that more than 25% of the -- of the sales are of aircraft parts is immaterial because we're looking just at the basic nature of the establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.591" offset="1177788">We are interested in this case, of course, for substantial reasons beyond the facts of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.377" offset="1208926">We supported the petition for certiorari because it was a closely related question to the question decided in the Kentucky Finance case which was -- how far did Congress intend to expand the retail establishment exemption in the 1949 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.493" offset="1289383">Now, the Fifth Circuit has had a whole series of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.042" offset="1303489">I think this is about the Fifth in which it's very broad -- has been very broadly interpreting this exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.299" offset="1336613">As a matter of fact, the Sixth Circuit in the Kentucky Finance case was relying upon what we consider erroneous decisions of the Fifth Circuit under this Act, the Taylor Fertilizer case and the Boisseau case.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.157" offset="1395963">And of course, this Court reversed the Sixth Circuit in the Kentucky Finance case.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.681" offset="1418115">The Fifth Circuit is -- even after the Bekins case when this Court indicated that the 1949 amendment did not go so far as to expand the retail establishment exemption to include wholly new types of businesses, the Fifth Circuit has continued to rely on Taylor Fertilizer and these other decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.323" offset="1512678">Now, of course, Kentucky Finance came down after the Fifth Circuit's decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.233" offset="1536293">But judging from its continued reliance on Taylor Fertilizer, although we think this Court didn't explicitly reject -- overrule it, we think that the Bekins decision did discredit it and the Fifth Circuit apparently has not interpreted the Bekins decision as casting any doubt on its earlier decisions interpreting the retail establishment exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.459" offset="1645171">Now, we believe that we -- it looks as if -- unless this Court explicitly overrules these earlier Fifth Circuit cases, we think we're going to continue to have trouble in that circuit with these decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.557" offset="1705566">Certainly, the lower courts are going to continue to follow them and the indications are that the Fifth Circuit itself will, as long as this Court doesn't say something explicitly about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.731" offset="1906291">He appealed it and he put the employee to the expense of the appeal, and the issue is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.779" offset="1922487">And this decision, as I think I can demonstrate to the Court, does reflect that the -- what the Fifth Circuit is doing with this exemption and how broadly it is construing it and how erroneously we think.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.047" offset="1991555">He's construing it erroneously, I think, in virtually every respect but there are four basic errors which I think are reflected in the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.171" offset="2036067">The first basic error which is clearly reflected in the decision is very closely related to the one involved in Kentucky Finance.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.548" offset="2081520">That is, the State, in so many words in the Taylor Fertilizer case, and they have followed it in this case, that Congress, by the 1949 amendment, intended to broadly expand this exemption to include manufacturing activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.107" offset="2159783">And that -- on that score, the legislative history, and I think one of the difficulties of the Court of Appeals -- this Court of Appeals is its refusal to look at the legislative history because if there is any ambiguity in this amended exemption, the legislative history clears up that ambiguity so far as the questions that are raised in this case are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.622" offset="2285902">They clear it up beyond doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.395" offset="2296978">Now, the -- this first idea that it covers manufacturing enterprises was not only specifically taken care of by special provision in the 1949 amendment but the legislative debates, the House -- the reports -- the legislative reports specifically pointed out that Section 13 (a) (2), which is the section the Court held applicable here, “does not,” and I'm quoting from the House Report -- House Conference Report, “does not apply to any manufacturing activities since any such activities, when conducted by retail establishments, if exempt, are intended to be exempt under 13 (a) (4).”</text>
            <text syncTime="601.479" offset="2509302">Now, that was the new provision put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.884" offset="2522885">Senator Holland who was the chief sponsor of the amendment in the Senate, said the same thing that Section 13 (a) (2) has no -- has no item of manufacturing involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.024" offset="2571473">And the House Conference Report then went on to -- to point out that so far as the Section 13 (a) (4), which was a new section related to manufacturing, any business that when engaged in manufacturing, there were six tests to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.530" offset="2645452">Now, three of those tests were the same ones of the -- of the 13 (a) (2) exemption but then, there were three additional tests for a business that also engaged in manufacturing.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.080" offset="2695711">So it's perfectly clear from the face of the statute, Section 13 (a) (4) which specifically relates to this situation, as well as from the legislative history, that the Section 13 (a) -- (a) (2) exemption hadn't -- has no application where manufacturing activities are carried on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1731.413" offset="7029008">I think that this decision is -- it's clear enough what the Fifth Circuit is doing that I think it -- it invites an opportunity to -- to clarify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.148" offset="7067982">The third great error, and this is evident, reflected in all of the -- this line of Fifth Circuit decisions, is that the burden of proof of negativing this exemption in every case is on the Administrator or the employee rather than on the employer who's claiming the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.269" offset="7140498">And that's particularly important in this exemption because the amendment never would have passed, and anyone reading this legislative history can see this amendment never would have passed, if Congress hadn't been assured and reassured emphatically, time and again, by the sponsors that the burden of proving the -- this exemption in -- before the Administrator and before the courts, the burden of proving was going to be on the employer claiming it because one, the -- the objection to it, and this was a -- there was a great deal of debate about this amendment because the language seemed to be so susceptible to broad interpretation and Congress was afraid that it would be greatly -- greatly broad in the exemption or beyond the intent, and there was considerable debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.716" offset="7338193">And one of the main objections was that the -- these new tests were too vague and they would open up the way for everyone to claim the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.671" offset="7378108">And Senator Holland and Representative Lucas, Senator Holland, at least four times, stated the Administrator is not going to have this burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.526" offset="7413426">This is even apart from the general rule that burden of proving an exemption rests on the person claiming it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.850" offset="7442787">In the Conference Report of the Senate, “It is the intent of the conference agreement to place on each employer claiming the exemption the burden of showing that 75% of the particular establishment sales are not for resale and are recognized as retail in the particular industry.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.416" offset="7521050">In explanation, Senator Holland said, about four times, an employer claiming the exemption would have the burden of proving it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.856" offset="7554800">I digress at this point at another place, it says I digress that this point long enough to remind the Senate that no additional burden or duty is placed on the Administrator but that to the contrary, the burden is placed on the employer claiming the exemption to show that in fact, 75% of his sales meet these requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.649" offset="7641945">This is not a test which the Administrator has to assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.935" offset="7655111">Again, anyone claiming an exemption does it with full knowledge that the burden is upon him to establish that he meets these tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.784" offset="7690533">And Senator Lucas did the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.340" offset="7700773">He ended up one long statement to the House in which he said, “We're not opening this exemption wide.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.806" offset="7730552">He says “in any -- in any event”.</text>

            <text syncTime="1940.208" offset="7864195">The extremes to which the Fifth Circuit has gone in making the employee or the Administrator assume this burden of disproving the application of the exemption, I think, is well demonstrated by this record because, here, not only was the record devoid of any proof that this establishment was recognized as a retail establishment in any industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.823" offset="7974640">And certainly, the proof didn't show that the sales -- that 75% of the sales were recognized as retail, devoid of any proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.618" offset="8013824">In addition to that, there is undisputed proof that more than 25% of it was of aircraft parts -- to aircraft manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.609" offset="8053844">That's undisputed and respondent doesn't dispute it, although he states that it wasn't proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.262" offset="8076413">He -- he vaguely gets around it in some way which I can't figure out because even the Fifth Circuit, on amending -- in -- in its original opinion, said that 25% of it was of aircraft parts for sale to aircraft manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.420" offset="8153004">But there's no doubt on the facts of this case that the -- that the exemption test were not met and still, the Fifth Circuit says that the -- the employee failed to prove that 25 -- what part of the 25% or 30% was not for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.426" offset="8233044">Well, this brings me to the fourth basic area, and I'll treat this very rapidly, and that is the -- the Fifth Circuit's view that sales for resale do not include sales to a manufacturer for incorporation into products which shipped interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.248" offset="8312351">I think that our brief goes -- sufficiently enter that to show that the Fifth Circuit is clearly wrong in saying that this is not a sale for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.482" offset="8365328">I might -- I promised the petitioner's counsel that I would, at least, state to the Court that he has reserved or try to preserve his point that he should be entitled to additional attorney's fees for the Court of Appeals' work and the work in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.306" offset="8440560">He's handled the case in forma pauperis to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.351" offset="8456756">And I understand that he's gone to considerable expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.176" offset="8468041">And, as I said, the Government did not get into this case until after the Court of Appeals had reversed the District Court, so that he did not have our assistants in the -- in the original Court of Appeals action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.682" offset="8522062">Now, I don't know that this Court considers a question itself of these, but we -- the statute is mandatory that attorney's fees, reasonable attorney's fees and cost should be grated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.643" offset="8573994">And we think, at least, it should be remanded with directions in the event the Court of Appeals has reversed with directions to allow additional fee, if available, attorney in the Court of Appeals and in this Court.</text>
