            <label>Mr. Henry J. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">I would like to say something today to try -- Court by a misimpression.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.835" offset="130696">I think the Solicitor General may have given you yesterday when the implication was made that people who have been taken off the rolls under this challenge system would have to go back and take some different type of literacy test or different type of test as required by the constitutional laws of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.518" offset="217422">The same test is issued to anybody when they register.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.189" offset="236126">That is if they are challenged off the rolls and there is a necessity for them to reregister, they pass the very same test that they originally took.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.792" offset="286490">That is these people who were challenged assuming for the sake of argument that they were to go back and reregister, they would be required to take no more than the same test that they took previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.435" offset="341138">That test being completing the registration blank completely without blanks and thereby becoming what the Louisiana law calls a duly qualified voter.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.198" offset="400175">The whole theory of the Registrar's case, this matter has been brought up upon, is a fact that we believe that the Fifteenth Amendment does not even come into play at the basis for the Government's allegation of discrimination, should not even be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.662" offset="490036">Because the fact that these people were challenged from the rolls was because they had made a mistake in their application for registration not because of their color.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.773" offset="542490">There are no reasons in Louisiana law to challenge anybody because of their color.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.215" offset="568195">Under the Louisiana law, you must first pass a test called a literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.885" offset="598915">You pass that test by completely filling out the registration application blank.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.248" offset="628381">In this particular situation, we are faced with a Registrar who allowed his rolls to become clotted up with illegal and irregular voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.943" offset="683133">Under the Section which this case has brought 245, which gives qualified voters an opportunity to call to the attention, other Registrar, these facts, it becomes more apparent why you have a need for such a section.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.223" offset="760247">For instance, assuming that you have a Registrar who has taken office and let us assume that the same thing has happened -- has happened in Washington Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.046" offset="807581">I think from the deposition of the Registrar himself, where he admits that he believes that 50% of the white people on these rolls have similar mistakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.146" offset="864005">Of course, our position is that they don't belong on the roll.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.249" offset="876335">They are not qualified anymore than the colored people who have made the same mistakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.452" offset="905174">If the Registrar had conducted his office, we believe, in accordance with the Louisiana law, none of these people who are irregularly or illegally upon the roll, should be there.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.334" offset="972675">Now, the problem is what is the solution?</text>
            <text syncTime="220.345" offset="984795">Under Judge Wright's decree, this is what would happen, we believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.658" offset="1009977">We believe that Judge Wright's decree indicates that you must ignore these mistakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.577" offset="1037667">Ignore the mistakes that were made such as the deviation from printed materials, the miscalculation of age and the misstatements that maybe made or the misspelled words.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.129" offset="1083852">He says ignore them because the white voter has not been challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.476" offset="1109243">So then, he concludes that the only reason why these people were challenged were on the basis of their color.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.276" offset="1136515">Our contention being that you cannot, at this stage, look at the Fifteenth Amendment until or unless you can show that the only basis that these people were challenged was because of their color.</text>

            <text syncTime="273.076" offset="1195656">But if -- but if -- if 10 white folks and 10 colored folks are improperly -- allegedly, did not comply with the test called the literacy test, in -- as an object of fact, the 10 white folks stay on the roll despite that fact, but then colored folks don't, then, whatever the reason, there is a clear differentiation between white and colored.</text>

            <text syncTime="326.922" offset="1411009">Let's assume for the sake of argument that all the nine justices of the -- the State Supreme Court -- the United States Supreme Court here, all members are the voting society of Washington Parish merely for the sake of argument to demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.185" offset="1472136">And let's assume merely again, for the sake of argument, that we attempt to put the members of the federal judiciary under the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.582" offset="1505677">That is, we amend the Fifteenth Amendment right now for the sake of argument of placing a comma and adding all members of this federal judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.401" offset="1540995">I then go into Washington Parish as an individual and I say to myself, “Subjectively in my mind, I'd say, I do not care for federal judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.693" offset="1590105">And what I am going to try and do is to disqualify each federal judge from the registration rolls on the basis that subjectively, I do not like them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="382.817" offset="1634617">Whatever my reason is would be immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.197" offset="1648201">Now the Registrar, assuming that first, he does not even know what subjectively is in my mind, I then checked each one of the judges on the Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.777" offset="1838477">The ninth judge however, even though I don't like him, I cannot subject him to their challenge because he has completed his Court correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.947" offset="1875153">So subjectively, I had in my mind, to discriminate against federal judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.582" offset="1897723">But I could not bring that to a conclusion on one judge because he did not fit into any category for which I could challenge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.003" offset="1935339">So therefore, I have removed eight judges from the roll.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.867" offset="1954879">Now, the Fifteenth Amendment, even though I bear that discrimination maybe in my mind, cannot be brought into play because I cannot disqualify you as a registered voter in the State of Louisiana because you are a federal judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.206" offset="2016214">But if you make a mistake on your application for registration, which I think is enough to issue a challenge, then I can go ahead and force the Registrar to issue you a challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.933" offset="2075146">Now, what remedy do you have?</text>
            <text syncTime="495.247" offset="2084342">You can come in and you can traverse the challenge as difficult as it may seem to traverse the challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.150" offset="2116002">But once you traverse that challenge, the challenger has no right at all to keep you off those rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.978" offset="2151320">The Registrar must put you back on those rolls and then, it is up to the challenger to go into the local court and determine whether or not, he had a right to determine that you spell Louisiana, L-U-Z-I-A-N-A.</text>

            <text syncTime="869.634" offset="3581889">Now, what he did, in my opinion, is that he ignored that particular provision of the registration law of Louisiana and because he ignored that, he then came to the conclusion that the only reason why these people were challenged was because they were of a particular color.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.805" offset="3654614">In addition, he seems to take the position that under 245, which gives each party, either white or colored, a chance to -- to get people off the rolls under a challenge.</text>

            <text syncTime="911.610" offset="3749804">He ignores the fact, in my opinion, that the machinery in the State would allow him, in my opinion anyway, to do something and insofar as the Registrar.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.583" offset="3793690">The reason why I say that Mr. Chief Justice is that, Mr. Thomas, who was a Registrar of Voters, was in this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.863" offset="3830784">Some 10 years ago or eight years ago, he was under a federal court order not to discriminate against anybody because of their color.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.991" offset="3863385">In the meantime, he evidently, being afraid of violating a court order, took some people on the roll which ordinarily should not have taken just exactly from fear.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.054" offset="3903613">And then when a group of people called the citizens council or individuals, come into his registration office and attempt to challenge only colored people, he didn't know what to do so he said, I'm going to my state court because I have a federal court order hanging over my head.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.782" offset="3974457">So, I'm going to my state court to see whether or not, I can take these challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.532" offset="3989504">He went to his state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.196" offset="3996191">His state court told him, under our law, he must go ahead and accept these challenges and they've thought that he did not in accepting these challenges, because they were -- the state court concluded for cause, violate the federal injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.519" offset="4057422">So therefore, he proceeded to do that and consequently, he was sued, made a party to the suit by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.960" offset="4087202">But I do believe that Judge Wright's decision just ignored the fact of the registration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.831" offset="4110712">What he has taken, he has put on a roll, two types of disqualified people.</text>
