            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 416, Raymond Gonzales, Jr., Petitioner, versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.728" offset="206242">Mr. Covington.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hayden_c_covington" startTime="26.903" stopTime="594.234">
            <label>Mr. Hayden C. Covington</label>
            <text syncTime="26.903" offset="210944">May it please you, Mr. Chief Justice, and the other gentlemen of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.358" offset="236753">The writ of certiorari in this case brings here for review a decision of United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit confirming a judgment of the District Court of Colorado convicting the petitioner in this case for a violation of Universal Military Training and Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.482" offset="313344">We present to the Court by the petition for substantial questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.548" offset="341556">First is whether or not the petitioner was denied procedural due process of law by the Department of Justice making use of a memorandum of the local board that was made without any notice or knowledge to the petitioner that he had, upon the occasion of his personal appearance before the Board, exaggerated his ministerial activity when, as a matter of fact, he had discontinued full-time ministry therefore and he had no notice of this until effort was too late, namely, when the recommendation got into the Board of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.107" offset="491813">He had the opportunity to answer for the first time and then the Department of Justice had already formed this position against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.287" offset="524518">The second question is whether or not he was denied procedural due process of law before the Appeal Board by the withholding of the report of the hearing by the hearing officer of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.416" offset="581047">We have two additional questions that are procedural and if -- it would be reached if the Court does not decide the first two in our favor, namely, whether or not the District Court denied procedural due process of law and disallowing the request of the petitioner by subpoena duces tecum to command the production of the hearing officer's report which was for the purpose of establishing that he had been denied procedural due process of law before the Appeal Board in several respects and the withholding of the hearing officer's report, and then, also the quashing of the subpoena duces tecum commanding the production of the FBI reports which had been summarized by the Department of Justice and forward it to the Appeal Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.414" offset="777070">This petitioner registered -- registered with his local board in the Southern Colorado and -- at the time so that he was the minister of Jehovah's Witnesses and the conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.124" offset="823881">At that time, he was engaged full-time in a big sugar business working secularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.673" offset="850108">And also, he was a full-time minister, a pioneer in the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses having been certified as such by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.067" offset="895666">He showed these facts to the local board and the local board denied both the ministerial exemption and the conscientious objector classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.431" offset="933073">The case then proceeded on appeal to the Board of Appeal where there was a hearing before appealed decision and hearing in the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.527" offset="977481">In the interim, he had discontinued his full-time ministry and the résumé of the Department of Justice inquire had showed that he had discontinued his ministerial activity full-time according to the report of an interview with an officer of the Watchtower Society, the governing body of Jehovah's Witnesses in Brooklyn.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.917" offset="1051042">The Appeal Board denied the classification of conscientious objector, and he was ordered prosecuted but because of decisions of this Court, the case in Sicurella against the United States, the first recommendation of the Department of Justice was considered to be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.689" offset="1130141">And then, the case was reopened and reprocessed according to local board memoranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.158" offset="1156054">Then it becomes -- the very crucial and vital question in this case arises on the second process.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.821" offset="1194611">He had his classification of one and then he requested a personal appearance and hearing before the Board which was granted on August the 17th, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.923" offset="1243094">According to the undisputed evidence, the testimony I'm talking about now, and in this connection, I'd like to call the Court's attention that the Government did not call any board member, did not call the clerk of the Board but continued itself merely with the subpoenaing of the custodian of the records of the selective service system for the entire State of Colorado, Mr. (Inaudible), the Deputy Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.449" offset="1345181">The testimony shows that Gonzales, when he was before the local board, offered to prove that he was a minister notwithstanding the fact that he had discontinued the full-time ministry, but he never got around to the point of giving any evidence, whatever, for the purposes for which he want therefore, namely, because when he appeared there, the Board told him that they had already considered this matter and have their minds made up and the case was going to the Board of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.409" offset="1465031">So, he got no opportunity to talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.159" offset="1488018">Then he was -- and in fact, driven out of the Board according to his testimony which was not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.478" offset="1521246">And the case on that day, that very day of hearing was forwarded to the Board of Appeal and here, it's significant to note that nowhere in this draft board file is there a written notice of appeal that the Government talks about him having a right to file supplement to it setting forth arguments and facts that he felt the Board had overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.571" offset="1609644">But on the very day, and I call your attention to a paper that's not printed but which appears in the Exhibit 1, the Government's exhibit at page 42 in longhand, at the lower right hand corner of the Exhibit 1 there is called an individual appeal record.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.755" offset="1678399">Now, the record in this case has printed the questionnaire which has the minutes on page 136.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.049" offset="1731584">But that -- those minutes are not complete and they do not show everything that happened in this case, namely, the date that this case was forwarded to the Board of Appeal, August the 17th, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.934" offset="1783097">It's usually the regular procedure of draft boards to allow several days for a registrant to file some sort of a written statement before the papers go out.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.987" offset="1823326">But since they told him that he could appeal orally, and he did so appeal when he had no opportunity to complete his testimony before them are offered when he went there to prove, there was no chance for him to file any statement on appeal and also, there was no chance for him to make any complaint about this memoranda of August the 17th of 1956 that we complain about where they take up and copy a letter that was written to the Board back in three or four years earlier when he was a full-time pioneer and make it appear that he had been given a full hearing on the ministry that day and that's set forth on page 7 in my brief, in Footnote 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.712" offset="2034186">It's identical in every respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.331" offset="2044740">And on the left column, you'll see that -- to show that they copied that old letter verbatim, would like to appear in person.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.788" offset="2082565">If that was a memoranda of the local board of what happened to that personal appearance, it's ridiculous to assume that while he was then presently appearing before the Board, that he would like to appear in person.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.037" offset="2139512">My point is that when he took this appeal in this state of affairs to the Board of Appeal, the whole file was sent to the Board of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.101" offset="2183816">He had no opportunity to know that that memoranda had been put in the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.818" offset="2206595">Then, the case was referred to the Department of Justice and they conducted the FBI inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.644" offset="2233971">Then there was a résumé made of that FBI inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.314" offset="2252675">He was given a notice to appear before hearing officer, Evensen in Boulder, Colorado, I believe it was, and did appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.426" offset="2289037">And at that hearing, Evensen did not go in to this business of this exaggerated statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.913" offset="2319026">He didn't bring up anything about that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.937" offset="2335117">He went into a lot of other matters that's not necessary to relate here on this particular question.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.723" offset="2358314">And after having given this man a hearing and not having brought up this business of exaggerated hours, which the man testified he never did, all he did is, apparently, took this old letter and copied it in there as a memoranda of what had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.288" offset="2432502">The Government argues that he read that letter to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.929" offset="2447130">Well, there is no testimony to support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.129" offset="2455907">They didn't bring the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.144" offset="2459982">They didn't bring any board member.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="594.976" offset="2483284">-- when -- when did the petitioner first learned of this memorandum?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hayden_c_covington" startTime="599.235" stopTime="1049.061">
            <label>Mr. Hayden C. Covington</label>
            <text syncTime="599.235" offset="2500315">After he had been indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.309" offset="2508570">And he was in the office of Mr. Evensen.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.434" offset="2521109">And I was present interviewing him in Denver, Colorado two days before the trial in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.011" offset="2547440">That's the first time he learned of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.847" offset="2558725">As a matter of fact, the recommendation of the Department of Justice does not even refer to the memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.479" offset="2581295">It merely said that he had exaggerated his hours whereas the first résumé, and I'd to direct your attention, the Government said that this man fooled the Board about these matters, I'd direct your attention to page 165 and 167 -- 166 and 67.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.162" offset="2648064">That's the résumé of the first inquiry before this case was reprocessed showing in the records that this man have discontinued the pioneer minister.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.724" offset="2698219">And also, his letter there showed that he was now married and was doing masonry work, all of this before the second processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.307" offset="2736567">They say that he should have notified the Board when he was before the Board on personal appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.446" offset="2753181">His testimony is he didn't even have a chance to tell them anything about this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.963" offset="2771257">Before they -- he left, they did ask if he had any additional evidence to offer and he brought out about his having gotten married which they'd already been notified about.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.306" offset="2804590">But -- anyway, he had his hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.885" offset="2822875">The case went then to the review officer in Washington on the conscientious objector section.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.675" offset="2850043">And the -- that review officer then did not notify this man of this intent to rely on this memoranda or the contents of it, but made this recommendation against him adversely on this paper that he have no notice of.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.108" offset="2919842">He got the notice of course that they're relying on this contention after he got the -- after they had made their recommendation to the Appeal Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.047" offset="2951607">But after all, that was entirely too little and too late, as I state and show on my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.758" offset="2974386">Now, it's my suggestion to the Court that Gonzales applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.179" offset="2996120">This man was ruled against for all practical purposes before the Appeal Board without any notice of the position that the Department was taking until it was entirely too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.403" offset="3036975">They say, “Oh, he have the right to answer the recommendation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="737.176" offset="3052126">But that's entirely too little and too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.157" offset="3064038">Here's the powerful Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.481" offset="3073337">The records show 95% of all their recommendation are accepted by the Appeal Board having taken this position against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.596" offset="3101759">And it's preposterous to believe that he had a -- any sort of a chance to answer that recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.001" offset="3131329">And as a matter of fact, he did attempt to answer and show the truth of the matter but his recommend -- his answer was ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.081" offset="3167692">I'm going to pass up the argument about the hearing officer report having been -- should have been included in the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.922" offset="3187022">I take the position, the outstanding regulations that were in existence when Congress passed the law on 1948 and then again in 1951, required that it'd be included because the old procedure at that time required that it'd be included.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.041" offset="3239581">They say it's harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.956" offset="3247208">I say it's very important because this man took two witnesses when he went there to -- appear before Evensen.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.165" offset="3272077">And that -- purpose of that report was to give a record of evidence that was offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.843" offset="3294751">And consequently, it should have been included for the benefit of the Appeal Board under Section 6 (j) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.199" offset="3320142">Coming now to the subpoena business, error of the District Court in quashing these subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.753" offset="3346369">That hearing officer's report should have been brought to -- before the District Judge to enable me to approve that the hearing officer, at least, had included favorable evidence or had not included a record of this testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.832" offset="3402689">At least the recommendation of the Department of Justice is not even referred in any of this testimony that this man offered through himself and two witnesses before the hearing officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.216" offset="3440201">So the fact the recommendation is silent on it, then the way to get at it was to get the subpoena to command the production of that hearing officer's report and make the comparison of the two to see if this man was denied procedural due process before the Appeal Board on -- in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.046" offset="3515538">Coming now to the question of the error of the Court in quashing the subpoena duces tecum commanding the production of the FBI report, the hearing officer had the original reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.304" offset="3560573">The hearing officer used the original reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.145" offset="3575933">It's true the defendant was sent a résumé along with the recommendation that went from the Appeal Board to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.048" offset="3603519">He got the résumé of the first inquiry and the second inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.829" offset="3622640">But I say to you, gentlemen, that when Congress passed the draft law in 1940 and reenacted it in 1948 and again in 1951, Congress intended that not only the adverse evidence be included from the FBI report but also the favorable evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.403" offset="3692962">Congress didn't intend to have a one-sided presentation or a one-sided hearing in the Department of Justice on this conscience objector claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.545" offset="3729533">Therefore, it was wrong for the Department of Justice to make a résumé only of the unfavorable and merely refer to the favorable evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.428" offset="3773106">And I say this, that I have the right to prove a violation of procedural due process in the Appeal Board by the withholding of favorable evidence by the Department of Justice in making this résumé of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.588" offset="3825768">And when I -- the only way you can do that is to subpoena the original report and show that there was an inadequate and an unfair résumé made, just like I argued in the Fourth Circuit about the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.534" offset="3873520">It's just like litigating the adequacy of a book review on the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.440" offset="3889089">How can the District Judge determine the matter without reading the book?</text>
            <text syncTime="951.061" offset="3907584">But does he do it just by reading the book review?</text>
            <text syncTime="955.277" offset="3924511">It's as simple as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.640" offset="3933915">The law has allowed him to make these résumés.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.651" offset="3945932">And (Inaudible) allowed him to get by with not producing the FBI report in the administrative level.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.275" offset="3968502">They prosecute the man because he violates the order of an administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.164" offset="3988041">He had the opportunity to prove -- should have had the opportunity in the District Court to determine whether or not that résumé was adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.499" offset="4021373">Did it withhold favorable evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="981.808" offset="4030568">The Ninth Circuit has said in quite that Congress intended that this FBI inquiry and hearing on the Department of Justice be in the favor of the registrant, namely, to turn up favorable evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.794" offset="4078529">The very purpose of taking the appeal was to correct any errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.851" offset="4094725">The law says it's got to be fair and just.</text>

            <text syncTime="1054.272" offset="4320423">I would like to set in the factual posture of this case, the precise basis of the Department's decision, recommendation to the Appeal Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.759" offset="4362428">As we think that most of the procedural issues to which Mr. Covington has just adverted, in fact, do not properly presented by the factual posture of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.187" offset="4412165">Now, the recommendation of the Department, and I want to emphasize at the outset that under the statute and the regulations, what the Department tells to the Appeal Board is only a recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.013" offset="4463470">The Appeal Board specifically is authorized either to follow it or to object it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.557" offset="4485622">The Department's recommendation in this case is set forth at page 177 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.751" offset="4514356">In that recommendation, after the Chief of the Conscientious-Objector Section for the Department summarizes the report of the hearing officer, summarizes the material in the résumé.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.068" offset="4575692">He concludes that the hearing officer reported that the registrant gave --</text>

            <text syncTime="1124.678" offset="4602128">Page 176 and 177.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.648" offset="4618010">I'm first referring to page 176 which summarizes the conclusion of the hearing examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.218" offset="4652283">And the hearing examiner had concluded that although the registrant gave every appearance of being sincere, he did not believe he was sincerely opposed to any participation in military service but only to participation in combat service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.303" offset="4724590">The department recommendation said they didn't think they -- that could be sustained on this record but then, they went on, page 177 and stated as follows, “On the other hand, the registrant's claim as to the amount of his religious activities is so highly exaggerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.754" offset="4802435">If we are to believe the official records of his religious organization as reported in the résumé and recapitulated above as to cast doubt upon his veracity and consequently upon his sincerity and good faith.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.355" offset="4868786">Now, that conclusion rests on a report in the registrant's draft file made by the local board just after he had appeared before the local board at his interview in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.998" offset="4947362">That report is set forth at page 173 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.914" offset="4979022">That report stated that the petitioner had told the local board at the interview that he was then devoting 100 hours a month to preaching as a pioneer and an additional 50 to 75 hours a month in other religious activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.890" offset="5066898">Now, it is not disputed that at the time this incident took place, the petitioner was only devoting six and one-half hours a month to his preaching.</text>

            <text syncTime="1259.037" offset="5139519">That was set forth in the first résumé, Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.706" offset="5154147">There were two proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.844" offset="5158745">He went through the appeal proceedings twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.209" offset="5168253">And he, himself, conceded at his trial that at that time, he was only devoting six and a half hours a month to preaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.325" offset="5200645">The fact is that he only spent six months in the so-called “pioneer status” as devoting 100 hours a month to preaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.438" offset="5241083">After six months, he gave up his full-time ministry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.524" offset="5257488">Now, the petitioner has not denied at any point in this proceeding, even in the District Court and the Court of Appeals or before this Court, that a misstatement of this character, if it had been made before the local board, warranted the denial of his claim to conscientious objector status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.245" offset="5336377">In other words, he does not contest that if, at the time he claimed to be devoting 100 hours a month to religious preaching, he was only devoting six and a half hours a month, that misstatement warranted the local board and the Appeal Board in denying his claim.</text>
