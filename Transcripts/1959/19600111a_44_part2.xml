            <text syncTime="572.993" offset="2395303">And we submit that that is no barrier here because we looked at the past events merely for shedding light on what occurred here.</text>

            <text syncTime="642.606" offset="2673768">In the Gaynor News case, you had a union security clause that was illegal not because of anything that appeared from the face of the contract, I mean, the clause there provided for becoming a union member within 45 days is permitted by 8 (a) (3), but the clause was illegal because, at the time the contract was entered into, there had not been a union shop election as required by Section 9 (e) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.246" offset="2808351">So, it was necessary to leave the face of the contract for the purpose of ascertaining whether this past event had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.946" offset="2847117">And the Board found and the Second Circuit in an opinion by Judge Frank upheld the Board's finding that 10 (b) was not barred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.223" offset="2908244">Whatever may be said about the execution of the contract, the maintenance of that illegal contract within the limitations period, notwithstanding the fact that you had to leave the face of the contract to determine its illegality, was a separate unfair labor practice as to which, as Judge Frank put it, the limitations period had not yet begun to run.</text>

            <text syncTime="1670.782" offset="6786487">We have discussed it in our brief however.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.183" offset="6804146">We believe that the riders had a broader sweep than 10 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.995" offset="6831313">In the first place, the language of the original rider which was introduced in 1944 provided in relevant part that no funds shall be used in any way in connection with a complaint arising over an agreement between management and labor which has been in existence for three months or longer without a complaint being filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.237" offset="6936325">This language would have precluded using the agreement for any purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.181" offset="6968090">You couldn't predicate a violation on the contract even if it were invalid on its face, a situation which petitioners concede would not be barred by Section 10 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.703" offset="7026186">And I think the reason for that is that, and this is borne out by the legislative history of the -- of the riders, that the purpose that Congress had there was a broader purpose than they had with respect to 10 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.859" offset="7098807">They weren't concerned solely with protecting against stale claims rather, the riders were designed to prevent interruptions to war production through a tax by outside unions on closed-shop contracts that had been entered into in the -- in the defense industries and -- and the shipyards where the necessary production was being gotten out and the employees immediately involved weren't complaining about the illegality of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.684" offset="7238092">In other words, it was aimed at preventing disruption to wartime production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.188" offset="7272155">What this wartime objective, Congress could well have continence and, we in -- as we think the language of the riders shows, more of an invasion on the statutory rights of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.863" offset="7330774">Then, it was going to permit in 1947 when it came around to enacting a limitations provision as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.760" offset="7366405">And therefore, we think that when Congress said in the Senate Report that the riders were unnecessary because they were now enacting a limitations provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.806" offset="7430562">This was merely a generalized statement to the effect that, since they were dealing with questions of liability for past unfair labor practices, specifically in 10 (b), the rider was no longer needed without necessarily suggesting that the scope of the rider was the same as that of 10 (b) which, from the reading that I have given to this Court, it is apparent that it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.744" offset="7550307">Moreover, it is very interesting that by the time Congress got around to enacting 10 (b), the rider had -- had been so watered down that in fact, it would even have had less scope than 10 (b) has even under the Board's interpretation because in the years subsequent to 1944, when it was first enacted, they excluded contracts with company-dominated unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.870" offset="7714879">In other words, the three-month bar didn't -- didn't apply to that kind of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.849" offset="7734732">They excluded renewals of an -- this is from the riders, renewals of an existing contract on the three-month limitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3043.516" offset="12277426">But what the Board was doing was finding that the agreements constituted unfair labor practices, the maintenance in effect and the execution and maintenance of the second agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.197" offset="12316191">Not defensively, they weren't finding unfair labor practice upon any other basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.759" offset="12334373">And I might just add this, Your Honors, the union security provision of this agreement is, in this case, a red herring.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.741" offset="12370317">Nothing turns upon the fact that there is a union shop provision in this agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3074.712" offset="12402186">Without a union shop agreement, you get exactly the same violation of Section 8 (a) (1) and (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.745" offset="12426324">As the Board has stressed, all that the union shop provision does is to aggravate the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.604" offset="12453804">It accents it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.798" offset="12458611">But the violation exists with or without the union shop provision.</text>
