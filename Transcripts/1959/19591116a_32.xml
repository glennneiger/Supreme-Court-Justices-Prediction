            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 32, Christian F. Braen, Petitioner, versus Pfeifer Oil Transportation Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.885" offset="150862">Mr. Seiff you may proceed.</text>

          <turn speaker="benjamin_h_seiff" startTime="14.849" stopTime="380.410">
            <label>Mr. Benjamin H. Seiff</label>
            <text syncTime="14.849" offset="162774">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.863" offset="170820">In this Jones Act case, the petitioner had obtained a jury verdict in the District Court in the Eastern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.827" offset="206660">It was undisputed that he was a seaman and had been a seaman for some four months prior to the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.968" offset="231215">It was undisputed that he was a member of a crew and that had -- had been such for -- four months prior to the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.088" offset="255770">It was also undisputed that he was injured while performing work that his superiors had ordered him to do, and it was undisputed that the injury occurred aboard of vessel that was own by his employer and where you had to be in order to perform what he had been commanded to perform and it is also undisputed that it was a negligent maintenance of the vessel that had caused his injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.803" offset="350542">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed and dismissed his action on a ground that the nature of the work that he had been ordered to do was such as to -- as to -- as a matter of law, hold -- or that the injury that he sustained was not in the course of his employment as a member of the crew and as a seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.410" offset="429014">In other words, the case presents the reverse of the usual situation where a person not in general maritime employment claims that -- he has become a seaman and a member of the crew when injured by reason of the nature of the work he was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.209" offset="488260">In this case, a seaman and a member of the crew is held to be disestablished on status by reason of the nature of the work that he'd been ordered to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.549" offset="525563">And the basic question in this case is what ingredient was there in this work that as a matter of law vitiated his Jones Act remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="114.622" offset="561821">Now, the facts briefly are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.328" offset="572688">The respondent was in a business of transporting petroleum products by oil -- the by barges and tows and vessels of that kind and one of its vessels was a barge by the name of Pfeifer number two.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.417" offset="625037">It had a crew of three and the petitioner was a mate aboard of vessel and had been a mate for some four months prior to the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.116" offset="655862">His duties were various, they included handling the lines and the cables, loading and unloading, hamming the hose, preparing food, setting up navigation lights, and included among his duties was also a duty of maintaining the barge which involved painting, scraping and as was called minor repairs, defined as with pairs which required two men, no more than two men to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.475" offset="757321">About two days before the accident, one the pumps of the vessel had become out of order and the vessel was ordered to the repair yard of the respondent in west -- in new and the West New Brighton, Staten Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.296" offset="812596">The defendant or rather the respondent maintained at that yard a floating repair barge called the Winisook, which was secure to dock by cables and lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.114" offset="855855">Now, between the dock and the Winisook, the respondent maintained a further facility, a floating raft.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.666" offset="882082">This raft is used by the respondent for the chipping, and painting, and repair work of such of its vessels as needed to such to work to be done at such time when it was needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.870" offset="922833">And when the Pfeifer number two arrived, it was moored at the open water side of the Winisook so you have this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.305" offset="948642">Here was a dock, the raft, the Winisook, the Pfeifer number two and it was conceded that in order for any crew men of the Pfeifer number two to get -- to go to shore, he would have to go by way of the Winosook, by way the catwalk, alleged that was man around the side of the Winisook and thereby get on to the dock by way of a – of a plank runway.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.074" offset="1039653">When the Pfeifer number two arrived, this -- this raft had been undergoing moon decking -- was being placed on it and a that the time of his accident about three quarters of a decking had been installed.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.366" offset="1100884">So when it arrived, the petitioner began to work aboard the Pfeifer number two, disassembling the pump and he worked from eight o'clock in the morning till four in the afternoon and when he got through, we – the board the vessel, he slept aboard the vessel and in the next morning he resumed work again.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.124" offset="1163891">It was the intention that he work until four o' clock in the afternoon at that day or sooner if the vessel left sooner and as the matter of fact, it was anticipated that the Pfeifer number two wouldn't leave on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.227" offset="1212270">He had been working about an hour, when a man by the name Edward Smith, who is the overall repair boss for the respondent, came aboard the ship and he said that -- that the two men were too many to do the work of disassembling the pump and he told the petitioner, he gave him the following order which Your Honors will find at page 23 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.192" offset="1312162">He says that, "I would like you to finish putting this top deck of plank for this raft over there, so that we can use it, get it done."</text>
            <text syncTime="311.954" offset="1351137">At the trial incidentally, there was a claim that the petitioner had been discharged and then immediately rehired as a compensate to give him a chance to make a day's pay for working on this raft, as described, but that was categorically denied and my friend here has abandoned any implications that flow from that claimed discharge which in any event was for the jury to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.992" offset="1439326">Braen, the petitioner having received his orders from his superior proceeded to obey him.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.326" offset="1456671">He got his tools together, he got his materials together, went over to the side of Winisook which was nearer to the raft, put his tools and materials down, and started to release the lines, so he could pull up the raft a little closer, in order to get to work on it – ultimately to get work on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.527" offset="1517484">And while his pulling on his line, the catwalk or ladder on which he necessary have to stand and which was part of the Winisook, gave way and he fell to the raft and sustained the injuries for which the jury had awarded him a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.399" offset="1564923">Now, these are undisputed facts which the -- the court below has held inter bit as a matter of law, the jury's finding that the petition was injured while the course of his employment as a seaman and a member of the crew.</text>

            <text syncTime="532.311" offset="2232613">Now the petitioner's position that the most of the respondent can claim on this issue is that there was a question of fact for the jury as to whether the injury occurred in a course of the petitioner's employment as a seaman and member of a crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.952" offset="2283186">And the petitioner's further position that any finding that the petitioner was not injured in the course of his employment as a member of the -- as a seaman or member of a crew, will be contrary to law or contrary to the evidence and (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="561.770" offset="2350477">First, as to the issue as to whether there is a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.667" offset="2366046">In Senko against LaCrosse in 352 United States, Your Honors laid the test down that the duties of a man during the vessel's travel are relevant in determining whether he is a member of the crew when -- when injured while the vessel is in anchor.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.974" offset="2427277">Now, applying that test to this case, we have man who is concededly, who concededly starts off work as a seaman and a member of crew, whose duties included in making minor repairs, who is injured when about to perform minor repairs as how he was ordered by his superior to do, and while the injury occurs by reason of a defective condition of the employer's vessel where he had to be in order to do what he had been directed to do and it seems to me that plain application of this only stated test in the Senko case just comes close to the finding that he was injured while in the course of his in employment as a seaman and a member of the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.893" offset="2582967">My friend here says that it is not enough that all these conceded facts that are not enough, that there must be an additional factor namely that the work he was ordered to do, had to have a direct relationship with the Pfeifer number two.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.806" offset="2642631">Now, assuming for the moment that such a relationship is necessary to establish the petitioner's right to a Jones Act remedy here is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.438" offset="2681083">The testimony was that the raft was used to paint and chip and repair such of -- the -- such of the respondent's vessel as needed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.154" offset="2715982">In addition, at page 48, Smith the overall boss testified as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.614" offset="2749837">Did you have any use for that raft in connection with doing any work on the Pfeifer number two?</text>
            <text syncTime="675.762" offset="2806471">Answer, "Not at that time."</text>
            <text syncTime="669.878" offset="2806366">Question, did you contemplate using that raft in connection with any work on the Pfeifer number two?</text>
            <text syncTime="678.383" offset="2816920">Now, I submit that that answer, “Not at that time,” clearly the establishes that somewhere is in time whether today, tomorrow or in some other near future the raft was going to be used in connection with the Pfeifer number two.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.363" offset="2868851">Now there is certainly no requirement for the applicability of the Jones Act that the work as a seaman being – then and there connected with the navigation or the functioning of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.531" offset="2913468">I've cited with the Hunt case and the -- the Butler against Whiteman cases where the work was being done on the ships that were in the dry dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.971" offset="2939277">They wouldn't be used for three or four weeks and took (Inaudible) and as the matter of fact in the Butler case the boat was being reconditioned as preliminary to an inspection which was a preliminary to putting it into navigation and Your Honors held that the Jones Act remedy was applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.288" offset="3004479">So, I submit that by any test submission to the jury of the issue of plaintiffs -- of the petitioner's status at the time of the injury was the least that he was entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.075" offset="3051708">Now, apart from that, I say that since it is undisputed that the petitioner was a seaman at the time of the act when he's ordered to do work, he was a member of the crew at the time, that he was injured while doing what he'd been ordered to do and that he was injured on a vessel that was owned and maintained by the defendant and where he had to be in order to do what he'd been ordered to do, that the nature of the work he was about to perform whether it service the vessel or was connected with the vessel is immaterial, is irrelevant and the reason I say is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.907" offset="3175006">The question of the nature of the duties of a man and the -- the services he performed and the relationship to the vessel have import when one who was not in the first instance a seaman, tries to assume the cloak of one, the mettle of one in order to gain the -- benefits of the Jones Act and then all these matters are considered and the answers to those questions determined whether he was a seaman at the time he was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.159" offset="3268002">But that's not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.063" offset="3275630">Here, the petitioner was at all times a seaman and was at all times a member of the crew and then the only issue was insofar as the Jones Act is concerned is whether he was injured and the course of his employment, and there is nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.498" offset="3329337">And I think the language of the -- of the Jones Act might said very -- very clear because all that is says -- and your final language on page 3 of my brief, all that it says, "Any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may at his election maintain an action for damages."</text>
            <text syncTime="829.813" offset="3422647">Nothing in there that it had to suffer injury while servicing a vessel or while aiding in his navigation or performing some duties in connection with its function as a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.703" offset="3474160">The only test is was the injury sustained in the course of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.720" offset="3498297">In such a case, the law is clear, and I cited any number of cases in that point, but a seaman does not lose his Jones Act remedy because he's been ordered to do something which ordinarily a seaman doesn't do, so long he is a seaman that performing orders and he's injured in the performance of those orders by a defective or dangerous condition of a place maintained by his employer, he is entitled to his Jones Act remedy irrespective of the "nature" of the services that he's performing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1147.569" offset="4693661">But for the very least he is entitled to what Your Honor just suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.839" offset="4714768">Now, it is claimed that there's somehow or other the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act modifies or limits the application of the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.945" offset="4755101">Now, if Your Honors read Section 903, very short, it's on page 3 of my brief which contains the -- which contains the exclusionary provisions of the Jones Act, of the Harbor Workers' Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.057" offset="4807555">All that says is, "No compensation shall be payable in respect to disability or death of a master or member of a crew of any vessel."</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.524" offset="4849455">It's very simple and then an ambiguous language and in it I find nothing that says only, "Such members of a crew are excluded from its coverage as a servicing a vessel or further navigation."</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.032" offset="4899506">I find no conditions to the exception from the coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.129" offset="4919881">All it says, "Members of a crew are accepted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.760" offset="4934405">Here we have a member of the crew and I said that -- I said it necessarily he's accepted from the application of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act and the only question is what remedy is he entitled to and that of course depends of what happens whether it's an unseaworth -- in this case or a Jones Act case or a maintenance and cure case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.973" offset="5011310">Now, it's been suggested before but demonstrating, I wanted to mention it once again that demonstrating the fact that the injured is a seaman and a member of the crew, then the only question for the relating for the appellate ability of the Jones Act is where the injury was in course of employment, and that the nature of his service is wholly irrelevant, other cases, the (Inaudible) case that I mentioned and the Marceau case on page 15 of my brief, where a man was coming back from shore after a night of pleasure and he's injured on the dock as he approached the boat and they held that he was injured in the course of his employment as a seaman and is entitled to a Jones Act remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.456" offset="5153207">In other words, in this case if petitioner instead of do -- instead of doing the work that been ordered by his superior to do, were going off on shore or to -- for other purposes he had in mind, he'd have a Jones Act remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.697" offset="5206183">But when he -- doing the work that he's ordered to do, he hasn't got the Jones Act remedy and it seems to me that that's an inconceivable situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.494" offset="5249337">So, I submit that the -- the language in the Senko case epitomizes the whole thing in just one sentence, it epitomizes my entire position, and as I've quoted from it at page 18 in my brief, it says, "Coverage of the Jones Act depends only on the finding if the injured was an employee of the vessel engaged in a course of his employment at the time of his injury."</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.936" offset="5347140">Now, that's this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.396" offset="5352991">He was a seaman, a member of the crew, injured in the course of his employment while doing he'd been ordered to do and since all of the facts are undisputed and the jury has found that there was negligence in the maintenance of the vessel which caused the injury, I submit that his entitled to reinstatement of this judgment which brings me just for a few moments with my second point is what remedy is he entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.604" offset="5437837">In view of the fact that the lower court has said that if they were an error, there was an error in holding if there was no question of fact, they would reverse in any event in order a new trial because of the District Court's refusal to charge certain requests of the respondent all of which dealt with the status of the petitioner at the time his injury and it's my position that he's entitled to reinstatement of the judgment for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.417" offset="5533027">First, that the denial of request did not constitute error and second if they did constitute error, it was harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.599" offset="5561762">Now, Your Honor will find -- Your Honors will find the request at page 75 of the record and if they are recited in the opinion of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.970" offset="5603244">The first request was the mere fact that the plaintiff had been a seaman and member of the crew of the barge Pfeifer number two prior to his injury does not entitle him to maintain this action against his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.264" offset="5668446">Now, I submit that this request clarifies no issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.216" offset="5680253">It defines nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.930" offset="5687045">At best it is caution of some kind which the record discloses, no need for such a caution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.581" offset="5713690">It seems to me that if every time, every fear that a lawyer has during a trial it would be laid by our specific request, you'd never had an end to a charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.937" offset="5747127">And then it has confusing language this action -- it does not entitle him to maintain this action against the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.893" offset="5778996">I don't know what it would mean to a jury it sound as if, involve to right to sue and I certainly think that the refusal of that request constitutes no error -- no error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.803" offset="5818598">Now, request number two was, it is the nature in character of the work being performed by the plaintiff at the time of his injury, was a -- at the time of his injury was sustained which determines whether he has the right to maintain this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.610" offset="5885785">This is a very general, a very abstract preposition of law taken from a text book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.016" offset="5903444">Certainly has no relation to the fact, insofar as the jury is concern that they have to decide and I think as the general abstract composition of law, it was not incumbent upon the trial court, the District Court to charge it, there is no error to refuse it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1473.529" offset="5997484">Now, I will come to that in a moment why they say that it was harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.567" offset="6021622">The third request is that you find that the work which plaintiff was performing at the time he sustained his injury was not in connection with the furtherance of the navigation of the Pfeifer number two, the verdict received for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.317" offset="6072613">Now, I -- the term “navigation”, I submit is a word of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.196" offset="6092152">What a jury -- what a jury's notion might be when they're told that use, told about navigation -- to me I mean -- it would seems to me, would be -- would be limited ton something like the -- the science of laying out of course and keeping to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.332" offset="6144711">That would be the lame notion of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.606" offset="6153801">And the law, of course also as activities can be in furtherance of navigation being a bartender, beautician, or repair that the -- the catalog of things that can be done in -- in order to further navigation without end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.377" offset="6204897">So, I say that unexplained the term, the use of the word “navigation” to a jury will tend to mislead and confuse rather to clarify and guide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.574" offset="6241677">And the fourth request was that the evidence show -- that at the time plaintiff sustained his injury, he was in furtherance of the work completing the laying of the deck on the raft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.202" offset="6276159">But first of all, as Your Honors know that is not quite accurate since he had never gotten to that point, yet he was only making ready for it and then unless you find that this work was being done by the plaintiff as a member of the crew of the Pfeifer number two, expressly for the purpose of furthering the repair of the Pfeifer number two in order to enable it to continue in navigation, the verdict must be for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.607" offset="6361840">And I submit that this request has the same deficiencies with request number three has in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.937" offset="6383156">And second of all, it implied unless the word then and there, then it forget the vessel as of the verdict for the defendant and I've indicated that is not the correct law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.545" offset="6421504">So, I submit that the refusal to charge as requested did not constitute error, but assuming that they were error then I say on the fact of this case on this record, it was harmless error, since it is undisputed that the petitioner was a seaman and a member of the crew, injured in a course of doing what he'd been ordered to do on a vessel, on a place where he had to be in order to perform the work then any finding that he was not injured in the course of his employment as a seaman and a member of the crew would be against the evidence could be country to law, could be insupportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.338" offset="6556714">And hence to the errors that then he was harmless and he's entitled to reinstatement of the judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.406" offset="6701014">It has not been argued in petitioner's brief, it was not argued below, and I submit to Your Honors it is not the situation that this man sustained his injury while going off to Pfeifer two before beginning engagement in the other work that he'd been ordered to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.805" offset="6790562">I would like Your Honors to look again at the diagram which is on page 55.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.187" offset="6828074">And you will see by referring to that diagram, that in the diagram there is a little rectangle mark repair raft, above the repair barge, Winisook and to the right of that you will see an X in the neighborhood of where there -- is written approximately eight feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.912" offset="6930996">If you will refer to the pictures on page 56, you'll find a line leading from an opening on the barge, that line being out along the catwalk tied to a bit which is set in a recess in the side of the covered barge at that point, that is the point from which Mr. Braen fell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.994" offset="7039352">At the time that he fell, he was in a crouched position attempting unloosen that line, in order to pull the weight craft from the position in which it is as shown in the diagram on page 55 up to the position under the X from which he fell as shown in the diagram on page 55.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.696" offset="7138200">And if you will refer to the trial minutes the record at page 24, at the top of the page you will find that he testified at this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.793" offset="7202565">Upon receiving the orders from Mr. Smith to finished laying this deck on the raft, I first proceeded to get the necessary hammer, nails and saw and other materials, up to the door that I'm intended to use which was on the northwest end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.856" offset="7258781">After getting the material, I proceed out along the raft would be intention of releasing this line and doing just as I have described to Your Honor and the full description of it continues successively through page 24 into page 25 up to the point of where he slipped while you turn on, I'm loosing this line and fell on to the raft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.791" offset="7334536">So, that at the time that he was injured, it was apparent at the trial, it was so argued in the Court of Appeals and the briefs of the petitioner and my brief have developed or had been developed upon the premise that at the time this man sustained his injury, he had started to perform work which he had been ordered to perform this by Mr. Edward Smith.</text>

            <text syncTime="3039.764" offset="12262379">Now, I say to you by that same test that you have laid down, you have here a case where the Court of Appeals did correctly, applying the test which you have enunciated, consistently enunciated, has held that this man who normally would come under the Jones Act, whose general employment would bring him under Jones Act, because of the particular activity which he was engaged at time, which had no relation whatever to the navigation of the vessel of which he had been a crew member comes exclusively under Longshoremen's Act, which supersedes the Jones Act where it is applicable and it's applicable here because this was injury to a maritime worker on navigable waters who at the time did not sustain his injury in the course of his employment as a member of a crew of a vessel as such and that is what you have said time after time at every case that written on the subjects without any variation.</text>
