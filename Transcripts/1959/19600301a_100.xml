          <turn speaker="lester_p_schoene" startTime="29.640" stopTime="300.815">
            <label>Mr. Lester P. Schoene</label>
            <text syncTime="29.640" offset="221915">If the Court please, this case is here as a result of this Court's order of October the 12th, 1959, granting a petition for a writ certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.302" offset="288580">That judgment reversed the judgment of the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, which had denied a permanent injunction against a strike and have dismissed the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.217" offset="356289">The attempted strike arose out of a union's proposal under the Railway Labor Act to amend the existing agreements to include a rule, providing that no position in existence on December 3rd, 1957, will be abolished or discontinued except by agreement between the carrier and the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.233" offset="460257">The opinion of the court below, goes into considerable discussion of the facts which we believe to be largely irrelevant and I think its holding can be readily summarized by a few quotations, beginning on page 382 of the record where the Court of Appeals' opinion appears, it actually begins a few pages earlier than that on page 377 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.717" offset="586271">With respect to the proposal that I have quoted, the Court of Appeals said on page 382, “Certainly, the Railway Labor Act does not divest a carrier of the right to manage and control the administrative functions of its business enterprise and conduct its business operations without exercise of a veto power by the union.”</text>
            <text syncTime="143.037" offset="675506">Here, the union is demanding such veto power over the abolition of any position in existence on December 3rd, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.362" offset="708838">The union is attempting to obtain through the collective bargaining processes through Railway Labor Act that which would prohibit North Western from complying with the orders of the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission and the Iowa State Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.602" offset="765785">In short, this is an attempt by the union to erogate to itself the prerogatives that have been traditionally and rightfully managements while at the same time assuming none of the corresponding burdens and responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.547" offset="821582">Then turning to page 384, near the bottom of the page, the Court in further substantiation of that holding sirs, we see no material difference between the Howard case and the case before us, the reference to the Howard case is of course to the decision of this Court in Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen against Howard at 343 U.S. 768.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.171" offset="948015">And then on page 385 of the record, the Court says, “We therefore hold that such a demand thus here made by the union is completely outside the ambit of rates of pay rules and working conditions as those words are used in the Railway Labor Act and cites the North Shore case and hence, is not within the scope of mandatory bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.194" offset="1040175">Therefore, the terms of the Norris-LaGuardia Act are here inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.793" offset="1066506">In further support, the Court relied on this Court's decision last term in the Borg-Warner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.560" offset="1117602">Now the – with this holding, the Court disposed off a number of issues that were not specifically considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.414" offset="1161070">As you will note from reference to the petitioner's brief, pages 14 to 15, there are a considerable variety of issues embraced in this case, all of which are disposed out by the Court's determination that a permanent injunction against the strike should have been issued by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.185" offset="1260126">Now, in the course of the development of this case, there have been so many instances in which by taking facts out of context.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.760" offset="1486451">At the time that the complaint was filed, at least the part of the complaint seemed to have similarities to Chicago River -- Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen against the Chicago River Railroad and it seemed at point to present his sufficient claim of federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.397" offset="1564923">There was never any jurisdictional claim on any other head of jurisdiction, but as the case has proceeded the nature of the federal right claim has seemed to us to become more and more vague until we felt compelled to bring to the attention of this Court that in the present posture of the case, there appears to be a basic lack of federal jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.307" offset="1876616">As I said the taking effects out of sequence, out of context and drawing inferences form them has lead I believe to a considerable degree of confusion as to what the facts actually were and how this controversy arose and I believe that I can be of greatest assistance to the Court if I first take a little time, in fact a fair amount of time to review in some details the actual sequence of the events that lead to this controversy and this litigation.</text>

          <turn speaker="lester_p_schoene" startTime="520.532" stopTime="1130.206">
            <label>Mr. Lester P. Schoene</label>
            <text syncTime="520.532" offset="2185488">I think this is in one of these vague areas in which I'm not quite sure of what the holdings of this Court indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.049" offset="2223522">Now, this controversy began when on December the 23rd, 1957, the union, pursuant to Section 6 of the Railway Labor Act served a formal notice on the carrier in which it proposed to amend the existing agreement by including the rule which I have already quoted that is that, “No position in existence on December 3rd, 1957, will be abolished or discontinued except by agreement between the carrier and the organization.”</text>
            <text syncTime="567.577" offset="2373674">Now, prior to that date, and since Mr. Ben Heineman had taken over the management of the railroad in -- on April the 1st, 1956, approximately a year-and-half before, the total employment had been reduced from 26,000 approximately to approximately 18,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.488" offset="2469282">And that reduction in employment had included some 100 positions of the telegrapher's class other than the station agency positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.898" offset="2518915">Also, the Railroad had applied on November the 5th, 1957 to the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission for permission to close 69 stations in South Dakota or alternatively, if it proved feasible to close 53 stations and enlarge the agents' assignments at 16 others to include limited service at the closed stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.974" offset="2635316">Hearings in South Dakota had not then concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.413" offset="2649004">Now, you may wonder why I'm diverting to the proceedings in South Dakota, the reason is that throughout this case, the carrier, the railroad has taken the position that actually this strike was not motivated by the refusal of the carrier to bargain under Section 6 proposal, but was really a protest against the railroad station agency problem and was in protest or for the purpose of frustrating orders of state commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.854" offset="2782751">Therefore, I think it is important that the Court have in mind that at the time this proposal was made, over a 100 non-agency positions have been lost and the proposal to close agencies had been made only in South Dakota, hearings in South Dakota had not yet been concluded and of course no action by the South Dakota commission had been taken, and that was the posture in which the Section 6 notice was served.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.255" offset="2900407">Now incidentally I should have stated earlier that virtually all the facts that I'm reviewing are to be found in the Court of Appeal -- in the District Court's findings of facts and some inclusion of law which appear at page 351 and following of the printed record that is before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.604" offset="3005837">Now, after the service of this notice, the railroad refused to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.226" offset="3040319">It flatly refused to entertain the proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.749" offset="3054320">That is borne out by finding number four on page 352 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.093" offset="3083786">The letter of December 24th there referred to appears on page 34 of the record and it will be noted that the reason for the refusal to bargain by simply the carrier regarded here is not a proper subject for bargaining and the use of patient of management prerogatives and it made no mention of any of the other reasons that were later adduced for its refusal to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.027" offset="3219519">Subsequently, as finding number four also points out this same position was reiterated in discussions and in correspondence.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.688" offset="3278137">On January the 27th, 1958, as finding number five points out, the union notified the Railroad that it would have to treat the railroad's actions as a refusal to bargain under the Railway Labor Act and that it would proceed further in accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.086" offset="3375731">In accordance with that announced position, the union on February the 5th, 1958 invoked the services of the National Mediation Board that is covered by finding number 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.789" offset="3434559">Now, I would like to read specifically finding numbers 7, which says the on the date of February 24th, 1958, the National Mediation Board by its Executive Secretary addressed a letter to the Director of Personnel and the plaintiff, Mr. TM Van Battan and to the President of the Telegraphers G.E. Leighty advising that the application filed by the Telegraphers has been reviewed by the Board, advising further that the Board considered that apparently at proper Section 6 notice has been filed in this manner and accordingly, the Board have docketed the application as case number 25696 and that's a typographical error that should be number A-5696 as would appear from the record at page 43.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.957" offset="3655241">I call the attention specifically to the reaction of the Mediation Board because insofar as there is any room for administrative determination, as to what is a proper subject to be entertained under the Railway Labor Act, this is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.709" offset="3722219">Now, there's no specific finding that is bargainable, and that is subject of mandatory bargaining as Mr. Elson pointed out in the District Court in response to a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.131" offset="3763911">But insofar as there is room for an administrative determination under the Railroad Labor Act, the Board after reviewing the application from Mediation wrote to party saying that apparently, a proper Section 6 notice had been served.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.135" offset="3839875">Pursuant to the docketing of the case, mediation was actively progressed under the assignment of the mediator from May the 22nd to May the 26th, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.270" offset="3896404">That is not included in the findings of fact but appears from the testimony undisputed appearing at page 154 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.653" offset="3934020">Now at this point, I need again to diverge from the exact sequence of events shown in the progression of the case because Mr. Heineman testified, and it's not disputed, that on May the 26th while the mediation was going on in Chicago, then his Director Personnel Mr. Van Batten was there representing the Railroad, and Vice President of the union was there representing the -- representing the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.191" offset="4092113">On that date in Madison, Wisconsin, Mr. Heineman had a brief conversation in the car near the state office building with Mr. Leighty, the President of the Union and me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.013" offset="4155434">During this conversation, according to his testimony and we don't deny it, he asked us whether we would care to discuss the central agency problem, and made no offer to discuss the Section 6 notice, but having recently procured authority of the South Dakota Commission of close 53 stations that enlargely assigned with others, he wanted to know whether we were -- would like to talk about the central agency plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.792" offset="4270582">We thought we were too far apart to talk about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.992" offset="4287300">And I think the best evidence that this had nothing whatever to do with the -- with the proposed contract change is to be found in the fact that although the mediation was going on that date in Chicago, neither Mr. Heineman nor Mr. Leighty reported the conversation to their representatives who were conducting or representing their respective organizations in the mediation conferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.993" offset="4411329">It was something entirely apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.342" offset="4420733">Now, the reason I mention that is that that incident has been used in this Court by the railroad to seek to create the impression that it was the union rather than the railroad that was refusing to bargain whereas the record is perfectly planned from the acknowledgment by the railroad of the very first letter that the union wrote namely on December the 24th, 1957 that the railroad positively and consistently refused to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.290" offset="4552495">And it was admitted in the testimony by Mr. Heineman that he never had agreed to bargain upon this particular proposal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.625" offset="6689834">Well, I don't think I have either, but, I -- I don't see that there's anything basically improper about it except the 30-day restraint that -- And also on the same day that the -- that the Mediation Board terminated its services on August 20th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.619" offset="6769873">This -- the complaint in this action was filed in the District Court and the motion for temporary restraining order also filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.437" offset="6813132">The Court heard arguments on the motion for temporary restraining order throughout the day and throughout the afternoon of August 20th and at the close of the day, issued a temporary restraining order and continued the hearing for the next several days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.291" offset="6916577">At this point, another diverting factor enters in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.780" offset="6954506">The Railroad on August the 21st, the day after the litigation had began, the day after the temporary restraining order had been issued wrote a letter to the union saying your proposal of December 23rd is in violation of Article 6, of the National Mediation Agreement of November 1, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.216" offset="7088253">Now Article 6 of the Mediation Agreement of November 1, 1956 set a term on certain kinds of proposals such as wages, overtime payments, changes and rights of pay, changes in health and welfare payments which would not be proposed for change until after November 1, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.079" offset="7207685">Proposals relating the stabilization of employment were expressly accepted from Article 6 and as I say this was raised for the first time after the proposal had been before the railroad for well over nine months, after the strike had been called, after the litigation had been begun, and the temporary restraining order had been issued, the railroad also announced its proposal to submit to the National Railroad Adjustment Board the question of whether the proposal was in violation of Article 6 of the 1956 agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.431" offset="7397125">This was obviously an opportunistic and belated effort to invoke the authority of the Chicago River case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.556" offset="7437563">And the reason for this particular submission is very easy to trace because in the argument in the District Court, the day before, with respect to the temporary retraining order, the Railroad had argued that the real heart of this controversy is the union's claims that the station agency program would give rise to claims under the existing agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.036" offset="7563473">And therefore, the Court should look behind this proposal to amend the contract and should enjoin the strike on the authority of the Chicago River case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.930" offset="7615091">We responded that even though -- even if you assume that the railroad is right in its inferences, still it's not with Chicago River case because as this Court's decision a few weeks after the Chicago River case pointed out in Manion against the Kansas City Terminal Railway Company that the Chicago River case is predicated upon claims being pending before the National Railroad Adjustment Board and they had no claims pending before the National Railroad Adjustment Board with respect to violations of existing contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.266" offset="7772453">Not only that, they were not in a position to submit even belatedly and opportunistically any claims about violation of the existing contract because they had no such claims on the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3402.935" offset="13715101">And I think Mr. Justice Stewart in the New York Central case, when he was still on Circuit, dissented from a finding of federal jurisdiction in that case because he felt that the reasoning in the -- in the -- judgment in dissent in the TP&amp;W case was persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.983" offset="13803290">My comment on that is that I think the TP&amp;W case has turn analogous to the case of the man who stands along the right of way and shoots the gun on interstate train.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.195" offset="13856162">And whether or not, there is federal jurisdiction in that situation, I think it is a real question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.351" offset="13880822">I would respectfully call your attention, Justice Stewart, to the -- to a case decided earlier in Sixth Circuit, the Grand International Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, 226 F.2d, in which a white employee sought an injunction against a contract which the -- his union and the railroad that was proposed -- supposed to enter into.</text>

            <text syncTime="3715.192" offset="14964172">If construe in other way, Mr. Justice Black, we win, if construed other way, we loose and as I understand it, that has been a familiar test of federal jurisdiction in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.401" offset="15008998">Now, I won't cite the language of that effect because I'm sure it's unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.194" offset="15032195">Now, the ORT attached very premise upon which our contention rests, namely that they say there can be no such thing as an improper demand under Section 6 of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.835" offset="15094680">Mr. Schoene has now repeated somewhat from that because he recognized that case of one hypothetical that obviously one of the demands that could not be made the right -- the basis for legal strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.327" offset="15156642">And of course, they don't really mean what they say, when they say that no demand can be treated as improper under the Railway Labor Act because it must be remembered the Railway Labor Act is of two-way street.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.630" offset="15209932">The carriers can serve demands too and they can lock out the employees at the end of the exhaustion of the Railway Labor Act procedures if their demand was a proper one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.491" offset="15249324">Suppose that we would decide that we couldn't live with this kind of obstructionism with respect to modernization and that we serve a contract demand on the ORT that you cannot intervene in legal proceedings for the state commissions, for the Interstate Commerce Commission in which we're seeking authority to modernize our operations without the consent of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.697" offset="15366144">You think they would bargain about that, of course, not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.092" offset="15375757">They wouldn't have to and we couldn't impound upon that a legal lockout at the end of the exhaustion of the procedures under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.109" offset="15407835">So it is obvious that they do not wish -- really wish to press the contention all the way that there are no limitations upon the kind of demands that can be met under Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.796" offset="15446601">The second more important reason why that attack on our premise is unsound is because this Court has held in the racial discrimination cases that there are demands which cannot be proper under Railway Labor Act and which cannot be made the basis of a legal strike on the Railway Labor Act and which can be enjoined without reference to Norris-LaGuardia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.159" offset="15543986">And to the extent that they have tried to make it appear in their brief that all those cases deal with the situation where the brotherhood was bargaining for something which was contrary to the interest of a minority of the group, that brotherhood represented, I say, what about Howard?</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.684" offset="15638131">Howard was the last case in that series.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.925" offset="15647117">Howard involved bargaining for the members of the class which the brotherhood represented because there, the Negro minority had their own union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.800" offset="15694555">They were represented by the -- the brotherhood that came forward in that case with the demand that a class of jobs called porters be abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.023" offset="15743457">I presume that the brotherhood in that case was stabilizing their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.222" offset="15760280">They were asking for all the jobs and an another group failed and it didn't affect their members at all, so that that, that particular rejection of that demand is a proper demand under Railway Labor Act, didn't turn at all upon construction of the Railway Labor Act with respect to the duty owed by the union to the members of the class represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.941" offset="15835094">It was rejected because -- in the words of Howard Larvey which I think puts our whole case very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.061" offset="15867591">It was because of the repugnance of the union objectives in making demands to a federal policy implied judicial construction of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.668" offset="15914088">We say that when you look at the -- this demand, and the setting in which it was made with reference to its purpose and effect, and what was really aimed at, that there is an obvious repugnance between the union objectives lying behind that demand and a federal policy to be implied from a judicial construction of the Railway Labor Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="4175.535" offset="16805491">That brings me to the -- to the -- what the facts are and then what this command is really all about and what this lawsuit is really all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.698" offset="16842167">We have set forth in our brief a number -- based on the testimony whatever I know is about the condition of railroad industry and that is that without modernization, it is in real trouble that if the North Western Railroad presents an aggravated condition of that I can tell you.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.511" offset="16921370">The testimony shows that when the new management took control on April 1, 1956, there had been $8 million loss in the first quarter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.966" offset="16967241">The payrolls were in danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.012" offset="16983437">Our wage revenue ratio was the highest of any railroad in the country which is to say that ratio of wages paid to revenues and the North Western is slipping right down that slide towards this Court where it was less than 20 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4236.617" offset="17049788">One of the -- the new management did a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.540" offset="17061491">They dieselized fully, they spent what few funds they had on a new car shop in Iowa which centralized repair operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.751" offset="17106422">One of the things they found that was most in need of action was the fact that Northwestern was built to the grainger country and it is a grain-carrying railroad very heavily, and it was laid out from the last century where about every five to 10 miles where there's an elevator and a lumber yard, there was a station with a one-man agent there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.300" offset="17204537">With the passage of time, the building of hard roads right alongside of this railroad, business, now like business language, trains disappeared, and the agents found themselves without anything to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.045" offset="17271515">We conceives a project of trying to keep down the expense of those branch lines and these are the mostly rural branch lines by trying to reduce the cost of the agent's expense and with the hard road and the telephone, we thought it was perfectly feasible to have one agent go up the road five miles and do whatever is needed up there and down the road five miles and do whatever is needed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4318.617" offset="17377886">So, we devised the Central Agency Plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="4324.627" offset="17401919">We filed our petition under the state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.530" offset="17413517">We filed in South Dakota, November 5, 1957.</text>
