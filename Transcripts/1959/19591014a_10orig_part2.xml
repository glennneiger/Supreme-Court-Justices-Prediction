            <label>Mr. John H. Price, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.579" offset="125680">Mr. Patterson said on behalf of the State of Mississippi prior to the lunch hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.407" offset="145011">Now there the claim between the United States and the State of Mississippi does not evolve from shoreline but from the islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.643" offset="181896">The Government contends and concedes to the State of Mississippi that the State of Mississippi line under the -- boundary line under the Submerged Lands Act, extends three miles seaward from the seaward side of the islands on the perimeter of our shoreline.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.303" offset="264547">If the Court can see here, we have a chain of islands meeting from the east to west here.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.155" offset="283982">We have Petit Bois, Horn, Ship, and Cat Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.929" offset="303104">Ship Island is more than three leagues from the coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.141" offset="319927">It measured approximately about three and one half leagues from the seaward side of Ship Island to our -- to our shoreline, I should have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.018" offset="351483">These other islands are closer.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.065" offset="359633">Petit Bois Island, near the closest point, is about six geographical or nautical miles from the shoreline and Ship Island is the farthest island away.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.631" offset="401847">So the only controversy between the State of Mississippi and a Federal Government here is the difference between a -- a measure from three miles south of and seaward -- from the seaward side of this chain of islands here which they regard as our coastline under the Submerged Lands Act and upon which we claim to be three leagues from this, the seaward side of these islands into the Gulf, not to exceed however, six leagues from shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.457" offset="533191">And the reason for the exception of course is, since Ship Island is more than three leagues from our shoreline, we cannot claim under our boundary description, under our Enabling Act and Act of Admission that we go a full league, full three leagues from the seaward side of this island.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.529" offset="597452">We are bound by our boundary of description.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.732" offset="606333">We recognize that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.923" offset="615111">Therefore, at every other point almost on our coastline here, we can go out full six leagues from shore, but at this one point here, we cannot go quite so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.510" offset="657429">We can only go -- our maximum distance is six leagues from shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.003" offset="679372">Now, the basis of our description and our boundary is on our Enabling Act in eight -- May 18 -- March 1817, and it read thusly, “The inhabitants of the western part of the Mississippi territory be and they hereby are authorized to form for themselves a constitution and state government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="166.310" offset="768606">And Section 2 picks up, “And be it further enacted that the said State shall consist of all the territory included within the following boundaries.”</text>
            <text syncTime="176.291" offset="808521">You see the word, “boundaries” used there.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.109" offset="819806">Mr. Justice Harlan has pointed out on several occasions during the course of the arguments here, what is the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.387" offset="848959">If the Court please, that is Mississippi's boundary here, which should be described hereafter in our Enabling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.368" offset="872887">They so specified as boundary here, to wit, without reading at all for the sake of brevity, I'll go around the circumference here.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.256" offset="904443">Beginning up to the southern boundary line of the State of Tennessee which strikes the Mississippi River, it comes around to the Tennessee River and thence up to Tennessee River to the mouth of Bear Creek.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.620" offset="949896">It gets down the line down do what was then, the northwest corner of Washington County, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.907" offset="974973">I believe that boundary has -- that county has been changed somewhat, but then it was the northwest corner of Washington County, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.750" offset="998379">It thence due south to the Gulf of Mexico, thence westwardly, including all islands within six leagues of the shore, to the most eastern junction of Pearl River with Lake Borgne.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.328" offset="1064730">Now, those were as important --</text>

            <text syncTime="264.058" offset="1159607">Now, that language is important there because when it gets to the Gulf of Mexico and runs thence westwardly, it doesn't go thence westwardly to the most and east -- most eastern junction of Pearl River with Lake Borgne and then come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.224" offset="1216240">And as an afterthought, say including all islands within six leagues of the shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.083" offset="1239751">To me the effect would have been the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.203" offset="1248214">But I emphasize that effect because the boundary description comes across to that point of the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.024" offset="1275486">And then it runs westwardly and embraces all this area here, all the way over to the -- align directly to the most eastern junction of Pearl River with Lake Borgne here.</text>

            <text syncTime="362.309" offset="1552593">It is known as Mississippi's island, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.358" offset="1564818">And getting back to your question a moment ago, if I may answer it this way, as you quoted the paragraph from Mr. Patterson a while ago, as to how we claimed this inland water between the mainland and the islands out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.196" offset="1608182">First of all, we claim it by our boundary description.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.683" offset="1622079">We had a water boundary in the Gulf of Mexico according to our Enabling Act which was adopted by our Act of Admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.000" offset="1647365">We contend that.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.198" offset="1652172">Furthermore, as the Government concedes in his brief on page 254 of its original main brief, in eluding factor that cross statement about Louisiana, in the first full paragraph there, as in the case of Louisiana, we need not consider whether the language including the islands et cetera, would of itself, include the water area intervening between the islands and the mainland though we believe that it would not, because it happened with all the water, so situated in the -- in Mississippi is in Mississippi Sound, which this Court has described as inland water and cites Louisiana versus Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.552" offset="1813608">The bed of these inland waters passed to the State on its entry into the Union, under Pollard's Lessee versus Hagan in 3 How. 212, decided in 1845.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.618" offset="1857808">So also we agree that Mississippi has a marginal belt extending three miles seaward from the islands marking the outer limit of the inland waters of Mississippi Sound, under the ordinary application for three-mile rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.347" offset="1908799">And then it sets up in the -- in the next sentence here, the only issue between Mississippi and the Government is, as I've mentioned a while ago in beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.243" offset="1940355">Furthermore of course, under the definition in -- of the coastline in the Submerged Lands Act, which is clear to define there, specified of course we do claim that area also under -- under their Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.702" offset="1998137">That's the only way the Government concedes it to us, by virtue of being inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.892" offset="2014960">That we claim it by our boundary description and also this Court's holding in -- in Pollard versus Hagan, in 1845.</text>

            <text syncTime="594.667" offset="2482030">In our Constitution of 1817 pursuant to our Enabling Act, we started -- we represented the people inhabiting the western part of the Mississippi territory, contained within the following limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.907" offset="2531035">There again, we set our boundaries limits are.</text>

            <text syncTime="625.078" offset="2603656">Now, the next Act with regard to our coming into the Union was our Act of Admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.424" offset="2625076">And perhaps I should read it to the Court to show how we do refer back to our Enabling Act, “Whereas in pursuance to an act of Congress passed on the 1st day of March, 1817, entitled an act to enable the people of the western part of the Mississippi territory to form a constitution and state government and for the admission of each State -- of such State into the Union on equal footing with the original States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="655.252" offset="2724342">Incidentally here, Your Honor, I know of no place in the Constitution that equal footing appears, except in these acts of admission that the Court inquired about this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.157" offset="2759973">The people of said territory, did on the 15th day of August in the present year by a convention called for that purpose, formed for our -- themselves a constitution and state government, which constitution and state government so formed as Republican.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.045" offset="2815561">And in conformity to the principles of articles of compact between the original States and the people of the States and States in the north -- the territory northwest of the River Ohio etcetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="690.552" offset="2865612">So we come to the point that the Government's -- the argument there that, at the time, means this boundary relinquish theory, when you came in, you could not claim more than three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.254" offset="2908348">Does the Government say by that theory that when they set out boundaries themselves by the Enabling Act and says you may form your constitution, if you do so on Republican way and in effect, cite these boundaries, we'll let you in?</text>
            <text syncTime="716.608" offset="2969788">Did the Federal Government reneged on its agreement prior the time we came into the Union?</text>
            <text syncTime="721.821" offset="2990686">If you follow these rules, we'll let you in according to this boundaries authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1163.194" offset="4756146">Therefore, definitely positive that if we contend, that there might be an island here, next week or next year off and seaward of these islands here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.368" offset="4796792">And it must've been known when the boundary was -- was described in the early days.</text>

            <text syncTime="1190.184" offset="4864084">He must have sailed in this area around here and determined the nature of these islands here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.510" offset="4885400">And by the same token in 1699, when Iberville came over and settled here at Biloxi in 1699, he also ought to find (Inaudible) on Dolphin Island, which is over in -- another sand island over here in off the coast of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.716" offset="4950288">He stayed there for 23 years before moving on to the -- what is now about the area of New Orleans, City of New Orleans.</text>

            <text syncTime="1224.800" offset="5002533">Furthermore, when King George issued his Proclamation of 1763 on which we tie our six leagues boundary to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.724" offset="5030222">When he got this land in obsession, he divided into the provinces of East and West Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.988" offset="5055300">This part of Mississippi here below the 31st parallel, is a part of what was West Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.883" offset="5082885">He described West Florida in his proclamation as south of Mississippi territory, which was in 31st parallel, east of Mississippi River and west of the Perdido.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.324" offset="5128652">Therefore, this area, all in here, was in that -- that area and he established this line that six leagues from shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.462" offset="5161253">He must have known himself what the nature of the islands were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.208" offset="5176195">I can find no way at all to tell now where precisely the islands were in those days, back in the old days of King George and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1278.905" offset="5219035">And we must, I think, concede that island shift and move and certainly if a week or a year after King George occupied the area and divided this -- this two provinces of East and West Florida here, he must have -- he must have realized that if an island appeared further out in this -- if this was a chain existing then, that surely he would have reached out beyond that and got in the island beyond there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.087" offset="5323734">And by the same token, I believe, as what the United States in the Enabling Act set the boundary of six leagues from shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.965" offset="5355186">If an island had appeared, most assured, they would have claimed that island out there as a part of the United States, because it would then be in -- within the six leagues boundary line from the Gulf -- from the shoreline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.469" offset="5425298">This King George's proclamation of 1763 came on down from that time after dividing the two provinces of East and West Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.634" offset="5453928">West Florida then was seated all the way down the line just as West Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.359" offset="5468766">The boundary line was established and through the whole chain of conveyance, we -- it came down to us as West Florida under the Louisiana Purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.430" offset="5509099">If the Court please, there's one thing I'd like to close with is the Federal Government position in this case that national policy has already been started before the defendant States came into the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.965" offset="5551208">And that limited the boundary three miles from coast and a state boundary on the Submerged Lands Act on this is limited by the national boundaries.</text>

            <text syncTime="1373.844" offset="5598751">It seems that by language and by that attitude that the Federal Government says that the Government takes the position that by passing this Submerged Lands Act by Congress and by the President's approval of that act by Congress, then that it would turn in chief, this was April's fool joke played in May on the Gulf coast States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.412" offset="5677014">You've got to give some meaning to the three-league provision in the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.625" offset="5701883">We don't believe we can challenge the sincerity of a good faith of Congress and the President in putting that proviso in our Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.927" offset="5947120">It must be given some meaning by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.775" offset="5947016">It means something, else why did they put it in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.609" offset="5946911">Let's go to our rule of the statutory construction as outlined here in the joint brief of the States on page 37.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.810" offset="5946807">We cited this Court an ex parte Public National Bank of New York, it says, “No rule to statutory construction has been more definitely stated or more often repeated than the cardinal rule that significance and effect, shall, if possible, be accorded to every word.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.276" offset="5946702">As already -- breaking the abridgment to Section 2 was said that, “A statute off upon the whole to be construed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.187" offset="5946598">That if it cannot -- if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.805" offset="5946493">They read a meaningless thing into this thing of this -- of the three-league boundary, three provisions set by the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.609" offset="5961853">And if we had no form about this, there'd be no foreign boundary every established by any act of Congress, only by prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.555" offset="5989543">And if it's necessary to do so, I think this Court should hold that the Submerged Lands Act establishes national boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.088" offset="6015770">That is not a part of this case however.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.844" offset="6022771">And I will quickly show that Mississippi does not claim any territorial sea or any territorial waters, we claim only submerged lands under the waters, out of the six-league boundary line.</text>

            <text syncTime="1814.199" offset="7360136">If you run on down here for six leagues and then come over, you really got to go north a little bit to get back to where Mr. Justice Black referred to that (Inaudible) do that somehow, to get over here and he's got the islands all within it, without ever referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.632" offset="7429935">You don't refer to any of that other States, you don't refer to any of the rivers, inland waters and so forth, that are involved in the territory when you're describing it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.733" offset="7478314">So that the only way we think that you can read it, is that you go westwardly as it says along the Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.236" offset="7512273">And then to be sure you pick up the islands, you say including all islands within six leagues of the shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.986" offset="7543306">You'll notice the word, “shore” is used in this particular Enabling Act and it's again used in the Alabama Act instead of coast as was used in the Louisiana Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.541" offset="7597537">Now, we'll get down to what shore and coast means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.127" offset="7615927">In the case of Louisiana against Mississippi, this Court held that when Congress said in the Enabling Act for Louisiana that it was coast, but it meant shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.565" offset="7669635">And I'll try to prove that to you on the map.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.449" offset="7949145">Here is what the Court referred to as St. Bernard Peninsula which we would call and which the Court did refer to as shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.838" offset="7998673">And we started to measure from that point in and instead of treating it as coast which was run out -- I think it's a brief by all parties here in the States, as was the United States that it run out the islands.</text>

            <text syncTime="2028.568" offset="8217684">And each one closely together, but to admit Louisiana first and give it only three leagues and then give the other six leagues, if there was any such intention to do that kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.522" offset="8269511">But if they -- they did it with regard to the islands that there might be there, that's a common thing for countries to do, because you wouldn't want some other nation to come out and take an island that is right at the mouth of one of your chief water sources, navigational importance, navigational streams and be able to affect your commerce or be a threat to your commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="2124.470" offset="8601266">And there are thousands of them, maybe I think, we all agree on this Gulf coast along here and it would go on inside of bays and all the other points all along right there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2146.557" offset="8689560">The coastline would follow along the islands that they recognize as having inland waters inside them and so we are in agreement, I think, that the islands, so far as the coasts is concerned, would be the point of measurement under the Act and we come down here and follow along wherever there was inland waters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2255.278" offset="9124446">He said however that he claimed all from the source of the -- what is known as the Ohio river and all from the source of the culvert also known as the Mississippi River to the mouth and then he said to the 27th parallel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.725" offset="9242311">And he then went back a ways up from the mouth of the river to the first point that he could find that he could plant his memorial and he put it there claiming it for France.</text>

            <text syncTime="2641.581" offset="10669746">Then the King's advocate says “This is a claim of territory, alleged in the most solemn form by the directions of the Ambassador of the United States.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2670.273" offset="10784475">And then the Court goes on to deciding the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.997" offset="10823346">When the ship was brought into this country, a claim was given of a great nature, alleging a violation of the territory of the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.203" offset="10860231">This great leading fact -- fact has very properly been made a matter of much discussion and charts have been made before the Court to show the place of capture, though with different representations from the adverse parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.453" offset="10921148">I apologize for my mistakes the times it got the essence in the old style and it's a little difficult too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.532" offset="10949465">The capture was made it seems, at the mouth of the river Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.975" offset="10967228">And as it is contended in the claim within the boundaries of the United States, this is 1805, “We all know that the rule of law in this subject is “terrae dominium finitur, ubi finitur armorum vis” and since the introduction of firearms, that distance has usually been recognized to be about three miles from the shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.620" offset="11069837">But it so happens in this case, that a question arises as to what is to be deemed the shore.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.004" offset="11095437">Now you'll notice that he says, “We all know what the law is” that that distance that you can control by your arms which is recognize to be canon shot is the territory that the country has.</text>

            <text syncTime="3137.466" offset="12653275">After that, the United States amended by making all of the defendant States parties respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.682" offset="12698102">To that, Alabama filed a short answer and the brevity of these things in the -- the strength of Alabama's claim rather than the lack of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3163.756" offset="12758392">We made that a cross bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.453" offset="12773230">In my ordinary practice, if the United States had not been involved, I would most certainly have had a cross bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.629" offset="12801860">And it seemed to me that the Submerged Lands Act impliedly, if not expressly, authorized the State to file something to determine what they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.638" offset="12841880">But in any event, the Government concedes that Alabama can have just as much as anybody else under his answer without the cross bill, if it can prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.657" offset="12897991">So rather inject that issue into this case for whether we can sue the United States or not, based on the Government's concession to us on that point, we do not insist on the cross bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.790" offset="12958490">Next thing we filed was a brief for the State of Alabama in our position to the Government's motion for judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.380" offset="13008854">And I'd like to emphasize that that is what is pending here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.950" offset="13031215">We haven't tried this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3234.413" offset="13041037">We haven't done anything, except appear here in response to a motion which has been filed by the United States asking for a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.503" offset="13085341">Subsequent to that, there has been some changes in our administration, former Attorney General has become Governor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3403.042" offset="13715519">Well I submit that the Congress did not place, it did not place in Alabama's hand or anybody else's hand, a yardstick which struck the one foot the moment we call all to it to measure our rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.643" offset="13781974">And the one foot had got -- it's comparable to the three geographical marks.</text>

            <text syncTime="3749.938" offset="15103143">The case of Foster versus Neilson, decided terms that with all the negotiations between France and Spain that no part of the Florida neither West or East, was conveyed or granted, or by the cession to France by Spain.</text>

            <text syncTime="3777.854" offset="15214738">Now, we allowed the Spanish to stay in possession, it was regarded under the Louisiana fort.</text>

            <text syncTime="3806.174" offset="15328110">The foreign policy of three miles when it's subject to dispute and which President Madison said when he sees it that he's going to hold it subject to friendly or just settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.516" offset="15385475">While in this to Great Britain, he wrote to why did you incorporate that territory when you said you're going to hold it, subject to friendly settlement dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.023" offset="15427480">And it was a pretty difficult question to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.324" offset="15436675">In fact, I didn't find the answer from United States Government to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.401" offset="15452975">Now, getting down -- too much for those preliminary things, now getting down to Alabama's description which I think is the crux of this case as far as we are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.156" offset="15571989">On page 3 -- now this little yellow brief, is our description.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.219" offset="15640221">He said that the States here consist of all the territory included within the foreign boundaries and then gets down to the part that we run due south to the Gulf of Mexico, thence eastwardly, including all islands within six leagues of the shore to the Perdido River.</text>

            <text syncTime="3923.200" offset="15796224">From this point on, the coast over here, running from (Inaudible) over here is the Perdido River, the coast and the shore are the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="3954.120" offset="15919835">We have two lines drawn, I'll explain to you where they go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3957.720" offset="15934255">We got one that shows six leagues from shore running parallel and we got one that shows six leagues from coast running parallel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.550" offset="15989530">Now, the British description when King of Britain devised it and described it the first time, he described an area, six leagues from coast and said it run from the River Apalachicola in Florida to Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana, so we are a segment of that description.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.887" offset="16082944">And our -- our State at this point when he asked about proof, if that thought of our chain of title, I don't know whether we need to go back, and we don't unless the Court takes care of it, if you do, I think I need to find out what they were talking about waters along that coast during 1763, as well as what might be there when we admitted to Union, because we are a segment of that description.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.081" offset="16203734">Now, the distance from the shore, the Petit Bois Islands and the district from the shore, the Dolphin Island which is referred the distance that you can get from shore to an island is less than three leagues.</text>

            <text syncTime="4342.707" offset="17474226">Well, on full Mississippi Sound, as I pointed out, would call Mississippi Sound, which this Court said the first map they had was in 1866.</text>

            <text syncTime="4384.445" offset="17641200">And when you do, you got a lot of boundary beyond your farthest island.</text>

            <text syncTime="4396.974" offset="17691251">In this Mississippi versus Louisiana case, 201 U.S., there are a lot of maps filed in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.834" offset="17738689">They were not disputing over the eastern boundary.</text>

            <text syncTime="4419.666" offset="17782053">But the lawyer to that day without any oral to becloud that thing, and anything like that, they sat down to consider where Mississippi started westwardly, the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.473" offset="17849240">And we start eastwardly from the same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.851" offset="17870764">Now, Louisiana said and later drew a map showing it, compiled from the maps which it introduced in this Court in that case, that Mississippi started westwardly from a point which is 18 miles south of these coastlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4464.630" offset="17961880">Well now, know you can't see this but I'm going to leave it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.880" offset="17982882">That line was put on there and if it can enter by any instruction by the nation's theory that were drawn on that by the culmination of the map 189 1991 preferred by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, the boundary line between Louisiana and Mississippi and duplication of Exhibit E in the case between Louisiana and Mississippi and known as the Number 11 original October term 1905.</text>
            <text syncTime="4496.917" offset="18091029">And they showed that line out there where we claim it to be.</text>

            <text syncTime="4800.344" offset="19304782">On that appeal what his argument was directed to just that far, whether this Mississippi Sound or Pasacula -- Pascagoula at that time was the same as Mississippi Sound, but it seems to me disregards the additional language that 10 miles east to the mouth of the river Pascagoula.</text>
            <text syncTime="4823.034" offset="19395480">Now, the mouth of the river Pascagoula doesn't come out to those islands at the -- that he refers to at the end of Mississippi Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.703" offset="19438216">The Government concedes that that is inland waters, the Court so held in Louisiana against Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.692" offset="19462144">And we concede that the problem in their case is taking that as the coast and giving them three miles or three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4848.838" offset="19498715">But as far as their Enabling Act is concerned, if they're going to talk about that they're really entitled to six leagues or something like and how you measure that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4858.620" offset="19537899">It seems to us that this island, this language deals with the point that they come to the Gulf and whether they -- whether Congress improperly called it the Gulf of Mexico, when it was going into Mississippi Sound, the inland waters, or not, they still did and you can't find that's -- that point as being outside those islands if you also come to the question of the mouth of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.176" offset="19648031">You have to deal with it as a point inside that particular Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.387" offset="19668929">So, we think that their claim is not supported anymore than any other as to the six leagues that that language was used to be sure to get these islands within the United States that we had a reason of the King George Treaty and it just carried over and there could be no purpose really in using that language, if you're going to say it this goes right down six leagues in all the territories within it, because you do get.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.070" offset="19795675">Now, if you say that the line should be measured and come down to the Gulf and then eastwardly to the point, then you have to put those islands in, in order to get them in -- within the description.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.599" offset="19849801">And we think that's what was intended by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.314" offset="19860668">Generally, what that language is recognized as and we think that's this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5067.896" offset="20374967">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5072.134" offset="20391894">Florida claims under the Submerged Lands Act are twofold, it claims that boundary exceeding the three-mile limit at the time the State entered, and a somewhat constitutional boundary approved by Congress prior to the Act but subsequent to State (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="5090.977" offset="20467231">I will argue the first claim, Senator Holland will argue the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.388" offset="20484890">Well, we want to make a preliminary statement about the subject matter prior to getting into the basis of our claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.094" offset="20523760">The Truman Proclamation of 1945 declared that “Natural resources beneath the high seas contiguous to the coast of the United States within the Continental Shelf appertain to the United States and was subject to its control.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5119.791" offset="20582588">This Court in the subsequent titled land cases, California, Louisiana and Texas held itself bound by the determinations of the political branches of the Government and international relations and recognized a three-mile national boundary which had been asserted in the nation's diplomatic correspondence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.186" offset="20652074">These decisions gave efficacy to the Truman Proclamation, by also holding, the United States had paramount rights in offshore resources to the exclusion of the coastal states that dominion ownership to the extent of such paramount rights followed inferior right of regulation in territorial waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5156.102" offset="20727829">But the Court also said that Congress could take further action regarding the subject matter and pointed to the clause in the United States Constitution authorizing Congress to dispose the property rights of the nation without limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5170.188" offset="20784149">The Court also said in the California case that it could not go contrary to an act of Congress in this area of national power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5180.292" offset="20824586">Following the suggestion of the Court, Congress enacted Submerged Lands Act and Outer Continental Shelf Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5187.410" offset="20853008">These Acts carefully delineated between dominion and imperium reserving in the United States a navigational servitude in the high seas, while dividing the natural resources of subsoil and seabed of the Continental Shelf between the States and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.723" offset="20918314">The Submerged Lands Act gave the States in Atlantic and Pacific, a three-mile limit granted offshore resources, but treated the States bordering the Gulf of Mexico differently because of historical and special considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.376" offset="20976828">Each Gulf State was given the natural resources beyond the three-mile limit in the Gulf to a total extent of three leagues, if its constitutional laws prior to and after statement contain their boundary out to three leagues or beyond, or that Congress had approved for a State, such an extended boundary prior to the passage of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.766" offset="21066480">Such extended boundaries are referred to as historic boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5243.793" offset="21078497">We, therefore, contend the Submerged Lands Act meant that if the Gulf States Enabling Act original constitution or Admission Act, which operated to affect this transition from a territory to statehood, either expressly or impliedly provided for a three-league or greater boundary, that entitled it to the grant of natural resources throughout three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="5266.066" offset="21167626">Texas being an independent republic had a constitutional law prior to statehood different form a territory, which nevertheless, contained a three-league boundary qualifying it to receive the grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5277.799" offset="21214542">However, the Solicitor General says that the political branches of the Government in asserting policy and foreign affairs has in effect, either invalidated or shortly historic boundaries of States and navigable waters in the Gulf insofar as they extended beyond the three-mile limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5297.008" offset="21291447">He supports this decision by referring to the tide land cases of California, Louisiana and Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5304.297" offset="21320600">We do not believe those cases so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="5307.154" offset="21331989">It is true the Court decreed that the United States had paramount rights in all the natural resources offshore.</text>
            <text syncTime="5313.775" offset="21358425">And that the three-mile belt is in the domain of the nation as well as the ocean beyond it, but there's nothing in these cases directly dealing with the States' historic boundaries and navigable waters which were consented to by Congress and all the Constitution could not be -- could not be changed without the State -- the State's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5335.779" offset="21446510">We think the States' historic boundaries and navigable waters remain unchanged and they're operated for some state domestic purposes, possibly for the venue for the state police regulations of some sort and of course as a measure for submerged lands grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5351.766" offset="21510457">These boundaries do not now or ever have impinged upon the delegated inferior powers of the nation in navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.212" offset="21544208">That there has been some confusion concerning the States' historic boundaries as they were laid to the national boundary as admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.179" offset="21576077">The Tentative Draft of the American Law Institute in its reinstatement of foreign relations law of the United States points out that confusion, but says, it has been resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.919" offset="21623097">It says that using historic boundaries for measuring the grants, the Submerged Lands Act appeared to put the question on a territorial basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.037" offset="21659564">This led to the clarifying decision in Alabama against Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5393.294" offset="21676596">The States -- this decision held, “There was no limitation on the part of Congress to dispose the property of the United States construed in this manner the Tentative Draft says the act does not depend on the breadth of the territorial sea plane by the United States on the international law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.612" offset="21749844">Which is to say, we submit that historic boundaries, as a measure of the grant, need not coincide with the national three-mile belt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5419.827" offset="21782653">We think the historic boundaries are valid for some purely domestic state purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5425.379" offset="21804910">Although, they may never have had any validity as a part of a national boundary, they still serve as the States boundaries for congressional domestic grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5436.718" offset="21850258">We think it is immaterial to a decision of this case while they have any validity in terms of international policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5443.570" offset="21877635">As Skiriotes against Florida, the Court said that international law is not concerned with domestic rights and duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5450.691" offset="21906160">Section 4 of the Act rules out the Government's contention that this three-mile national boundary operate to shrink the States' historic boundary at the moment of statehood to the limit of the national boundary, because it was imposed into the Act an extraneous standard of test, not within the context of the Act, and would produce inconsistent result with planning in historic boundary, referring to a State's particular constitutional laws, which is not to be a prejudiced or questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5480.148" offset="22023920">While this first claim is based upon the act of Congress, of March the 3rd, 1845, admitting it to the Union, and upon this Constitution previously authorized by Congress and adopted in 1838 previously, these documents carried boundary descriptions covering a chain of title to Florida territory delineated from cessions of Great Britain to Spain and finally to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5508.752" offset="22138337">Florida's brief, page 64, a proclamation by King George III of Great Britain on October the 7th, 1763, officially and historically defines the boundaries of a territory of East and West Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="5524.351" offset="22200822">The keywords in the proclamation are that governments -- “The governments of East and West Florida were bounded by the Gulf of Mexico including all islands within six leagues of the coast.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5535.227" offset="22244289">Our contention is that these words are historically implied in Florida Statehood Constitution by a direct reference to antecedent titles and formal sovereign owners.</text>

            <text syncTime="6007.942" offset="24135137">And we contend that when King George III proclaimed a six-league boundary, we can say a perimeter boundary including all of our -- actually he said, including all the islands within six leagues of the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="6022.524" offset="24193442">We think he must have had some knowledge even in 1763 of these islands of Florida's coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="6032.275" offset="24232521">Some kind of description of a blanket in nature was needed to cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.690" offset="24258121">Anyway, we have -- those, I am sure all of you probably have been in the area and you know the thousands of islands of -- or coral islands are here in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6050.702" offset="24306186">For example, there are enough island along here for the State to run a highway of 100 miles to Key West.</text>
            <text syncTime="6060.358" offset="24344848">Now, we have developed going on all out in these islands, there are -- there are projected parkways, new highways, fields of all the kinds, and I wish you would, if -- if it has any relation to this question that this day, please bear in mind that all of the ground -- the Gulf coast of Florida, we have this developed going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6088.046" offset="24455607">People have bought as far as a mile out in the Gulf and are filling in at areas not prior reached, and it has to be made such, they actually which have to be developed before it is of any real value.</text>
            <text syncTime="6102.228" offset="24512240">But back in 1763, when this boundary was proclaimed to cover these islands, the situation was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6112.151" offset="24551946">Parks, and this is a part of the law of Florida and Florida Keys, parks operated in these Florida straights along the Gulf coast and they needed a wider boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.675" offset="24602102">Actually, we have been able to measure the new depth of this water along here -- here at many places, it's not over three or four feet deep.</text>
            <text syncTime="6134.565" offset="24641599">And along in here for example, throughout the whole area, it isn't more than four thousand on the average.</text>

            <text syncTime="6163.455" offset="24757164">Now, these clusters of islands all around the coast presented special problem and there was a real reason for a six-league perimeter boundary and a different, we think, consideration for Florida in that relation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6188.782" offset="24858520">Remember please, if you will, that the Professor Sone (ph) who has briefed this matter for the Gulf coastal States, tells us that coastal states with -- with very shallow shoal area needed a wider gird in order to protect coastal ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="6214.052" offset="24959561">Now, I am -- I am closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6216.609" offset="24969801">I want to say only this that it is a principle of law, it was stated many years ago, well, in 1909 by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Grisbådarna case, where it said, it is a settled principle of law of nation that a state of things which actually exists and it existed for a long time should be changed as little as possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="6543.184" offset="26276133">And incidentally, the two states by compact, proved by Congress, have so clarified and made certain that point of joinder that any engineer could locate it and that has been done in the efforts to clarify the property claims between the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6564.817" offset="26362650">Now, the Attorney General has already said that State of Florida has the two claims, one under the first string of the ball which applies to the boundary of the State when it entered the Union, which claim, as I conceive it to be, is almost identical, if not identical with the claims of Alabama and of Mississippi and is quite similar to the claims of at least part of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="6606.181" offset="26528057">West Florida extended at one time than the Apalachicola River, which is this location here all the way across to Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="6618.232" offset="26576332">And farther north, went to even farther west extending all the way to the Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="6624.945" offset="26603186">But Florida was subject to be shunted back and forth between Spain and England and France on particular occasions and it so happens that we lost that excellent part of West Florida now comprised in much frontage of Alabama and Mississippi and some of the area of Louisiana during the course of shuffling.</text>
            <text syncTime="6650.469" offset="26705272">We hope that will be the last of our good state which we shall lose at anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="6657.176" offset="26732126">The part of the Florida case which I shall discuss as quickly as I can in the time allotted, relates to that string of the ball, which reserves where the boundary has been extended in the Gulf of Mexico beyond the three geometric miles, but not to exceed three leagues by Constitution of the State and that Constitution approved by act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6689.881" offset="26862947">It is our claim that the Constitution of Florida was approved in 1868 by Congress and that the boundary provision which is Article 1 of that Constitution and which is being carried forward as Article 1 in the present Constitution, the Constitution of 1885, gives us three leagues off the mainland of the coast of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>

            <text syncTime="6819.582" offset="27381739">And in spite of the fact that the State of Florida had adopted a new Constitution in 1865, the Congress required the State of Florida and all other states that were in the confederacy to frame new constitutions under the Reconstruction Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6843.157" offset="27475989">At the time, it was one of the great confusion in Florida, goes without question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6848.063" offset="27495633">I think that the Court would take notice through the debates at least, that there was great confusion in Congress, because there was bitter argument of the most serious sort throughout this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="6864.614" offset="27561880">As a matter of fact, the Reconstruction Act, as the Court well knows, was passed over the veto of the then President, President Johnson, and then the various acts supplemental thereto were passed, as I recall, over his veto and the act readmitting to representation of the States and reinstalling their civil government, so that they could begin to function, again was passed over the veto of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="6895.266" offset="27684446">And the Court will know and take judicial knowledge of the fact that relations between the Congress and the Executive were exceedingly strain and that the -- after that impeachment began very shortly thereafter and came as I recall within one vote of -- of success.</text>
            <text syncTime="6913.970" offset="27759261">It was a time of bitterness and it was a time of suspicion, a natural suspicion, on the part of Congress, which did not include Senators and House and Representatives from the South in looking after the reorganizations of governments that were tempted by the southern states.</text>
