            <text syncTime="92.218" offset="472273">But here what both Judge Darr, the district judge, and the Court of Appeals held in substance was that there was no evidence on which the arbitrators -- in other words, it was nothing for the arbitrators to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.831" offset="534653">That it was so baseless and so clearly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.588" offset="545729">And that in this case, where the burden was on the complainant to show some basis, some grounds for arbitration and where the complainant had failed to do so, although calling for the court to use the summary judgment procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.957" offset="611244">And yet then, simply bringing in a statement from a doctor, Dr. Kinsey, this man was able to go back to a job without injury to himself or others.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.158" offset="667982">Now, as the Court of Appeals said, “That is not evidence, when you have in the record there on the summary judgment procedure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="150.314" offset="704658">The statements of that same doctor may just, a week or -- or two weeks before, that this man is permanently disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.620" offset="741857">I'd like to read to the Court, very briefly, that statement from Dr. Kinsey, which appears in the record at page 54 and 55.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.613" offset="785847">And this was is August of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.380" offset="800893">“I believe his disability was 55% or 60% before surgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.183" offset="820120">They -- the back operation moved a disc.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.811" offset="838614">And I believe, it is approximately 25% of the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.947" offset="855124">I also believe that his partial permanent disability will remain at about 25%.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.610" offset="881768">And it was on 25% that on September 9th, he received this and claimed this award for disability.”</text>
            <text syncTime="200.994" offset="907368">Then a week later, he comes back and applies under the provision for reinstatement as employee and is turned down.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.407" offset="941014">He does not avail himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.696" offset="946134">He knows that he could not get back in on any protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.336" offset="960763">They -- does not avail himself for the three day requirement, of filing a written protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.411" offset="985004">He accepts that discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.300" offset="992528">Then trying to do indirectly, it please the Court, what he could not do directly, we submit, he -- through the union, undertakes to be reemployed under the seniorioy provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.290" offset="1040488">Now, both under the seniority provision and under this matter which management in this plant had and the union agreed to it, sold a necessity for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.796" offset="1078523">This type of operations, a small plant with wax and the various types of chemicals and liquids about a department where a man had to be men and had do to the work and had to be able and efficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.536" offset="1129514">In both of those requirements, the contract provided and recognized that ability to do the work, able-bodiedness and equal efficiency must be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.348" offset="1184789">Now, the provision in the seniority definitely -- and provision of the contract definitely recognizes that the man seeking to be reemployed and that's what this was and that's the word, reemployment in that seniority provision contract, that he must have efficiency and ability equal to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.257" offset="1268381">Now, we submit, if the Court please, that it was definitely shown before the trial court and never has any claim been made by this man, nothing in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.978" offset="1315297">The complainant, the plaintiff, and the court below knew this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.354" offset="1332746">They agreed that Dr. Shelton might examine him after this matter of grievance had been claimed and they've attempted an arbitration arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.969" offset="1375274">They agree that he might go back to Dr. Shelton.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.498" offset="1385409">And if the Court please, what does Dr. Shelton say in his report there?</text>
            <text syncTime="325.716" offset="1406203">On November 14th, Dr. Shelton -- of 1957, Dr. Shelton had been ill in the meantime.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.352" offset="1428773">There was delay of getting his examination, “I see no reason to change my opinion as stated on the examination of August the 28th, 1957.”</text>
            <text syncTime="342.024" offset="1471509">And then skipping down, “At that time, I estimated his permanent partial disability to be 25%, for the body as a whole, for his particular type of work, I see no change in the physical findings, so I no see reason to change my opinion as expressed on that examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.314" offset="1536606">It is my opinion that he should not be placed at work requiring heavy lifting or prolonged stooping or bending”.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.070" offset="1563669">And the whole evidence and his -- the whole evidence before the Court in the preceding, was that in this department, where he sought to be reemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.214" offset="1604211">A man could not do the work without getting into awkward positions and stoop and bend.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.038" offset="1623542">And Dr. Kinsey on whom he relied in obtaining the disability award and who later examined him and found that he -- in his opinion, although he had been 50 or more percent disabled before the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.324" offset="1680697">In he's opinion, this man was never to be more than 25% and that is never for more than 75% able and efficient as compared with the ordinary able-bodied man.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.547" offset="1725524">This department needed, this plant did have a place for disabled men.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.839" offset="1742764">And that was shown in the record by the plant manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.434" offset="1753109">We submit, if the Court please, that on all of that record, the Court could only say, if this man's claim under these circumstances, was baseless.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.878" offset="1782888">That he did not have something that the time with the arbitrators, the time the parties should be determined by arbitration.</text>

          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="427.957" stopTime="435.989">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="427.957" offset="1815176">Well, wouldn't the question as to whether there was any work that he was fitted for, be a question for the arbitrator?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_s_carriger" startTime="435.989" stopTime="719.384">
            <label>Mr. John S. Carriger</label>
            <text syncTime="435.989" offset="1847359">The Court please, and I'm somewhat at lost to know how we can -- can meet the requirements of the summary judgment provisions rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.247" offset="1896364">The -- the plaintiff -- the complainant, nowhere claimed that he was able to do the work.As to these defenses were made and his affidavits went in -- in compliance for the summary judgment procedure, he did not attempt to amend his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.307" offset="1956551">He did not come in by any affidavit that he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.711" offset="1970239">And although the attorney who had represented the insurance carrier on workman's compensation matter, wrote to him and to his attorneys and said, “If there's been a change, we need to know about it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.134" offset="2019871">Why was it that you -- that you claimed and obtained there an award on a basis to 25% and now, claimed that you're able to do the work in that department, that you're not disabled?</text>
            <text syncTime="489.179" offset="2060100">He did not answer it, his attorneys did not answer it.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.823" offset="2070653">And that, again, is shown in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.934" offset="2079117">Now, if the Court please, we submit that under the provisions that the union, the complainant sought to the -- invoked when the asked for a summary judgment and then the defendant asked for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.119" offset="2135855">That that placed before the trial court, the obligation to treat it on the record as it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.647" offset="2153932">And had this man conscientiously believed that he could do the work, that he was not disabled, that he was of equal efficiency and ability to the other men and hold on to do that type of work, he could've amended his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.043" offset="2211506">He never in his complaint said he was able.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.097" offset="2219760">He never came in himself and said he was able.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.184" offset="2228120">He never brought in Dr. Kinsey to show why Dr. Kinsey a few -- a short time before he had said he was permanently disabled and why, if he could, and he couldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.348" offset="2272737">It stands for reason that they could've produced that evidence, that they would have done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.049" offset="2291545">Then, if Court please, we submit that under the -- in decisions and under Professor Cox's statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.118" offset="2331878">And there our adversary has mentioned Professor Cox in a number of places in that brief and -- and actually this brief is found was against or in connection with three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.065" offset="2387675">I'm only familiar with this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.435" offset="2393109">I can only speak in connection with this one case.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.371" offset="2404812">But as we have shown in our brief and reply quoting also from Professor Cox, who has been relied on extensively by our adversary, in the same article in 1959 in the Harvard Law Review, reflections on labor arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.701" offset="2478164">“Arbitration should be ordered in an action under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.637" offset="2493942">Whenever that claim might be fairly be said to fall within the scope of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.177" offset="2516093">If the latter contention be made, but appears patiently frivolous, arbitration should be denied.”</text>
            <text syncTime="611.252" offset="2548381">Now, our adversary in the reply brief filed, Mr. Feller says, that he agrees that arbitration of these matters should be only at the order of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.488" offset="2601357">That the court determines arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.949" offset="2611179">He says we have not indicated how arbitrability would be determined by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.128" offset="2635839">Now, we submit if Court please, that determination of arbitrability and this is the word -- wording in Judge (Inaudible) in the (Inaudible) case cited in our brief, 251 F.2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.893" offset="2698951">Determination of arbitrability only requires that the moving party could evidence which tends to establish his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.623" offset="2729880">We submit that -- if the Court please, that in this case, the complainant, the moving party did not establish any evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.507" offset="2757360">Did not introduce any evidence, either in his pleadings, did not even make the claim in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.780" offset="2782542">But simply said, here is something it must be arbitrated and as the court passes on for arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.498" offset="2809396">Now, we submit, if the Court please, that question here is we believe, boiled down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.367" offset="2836877">Is the District Court powerless to hold an alleged grievance, not arbitrable, where the complaining union moves for a summary judgment, but fails to make any showing of a real arbitrable issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.889" offset="2886928">And we feel that the Court does have the right and that the trial court and the Court of Appeals, both, although they reached the conclusion by different channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.115" offset="2919842">Both found that in this case, the plaintiff had not carried out that minimum requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.623" offset="2949831">I'm showing that there were some basis, some grounds on which arbitration -- for which arbitration should be awarded.</text>

            <text syncTime="727.204" offset="3012211">I think the issue is now been posed very clearly by Mr. Carriger.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.080" offset="3031646">The issue is whether the plaintiffs who comes in and ask that the court enforce the agreement to arbitrator, has to introduce evidence in the court dealing not with the promise to arbitrate, but with the substantive provision which he wants determined in arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.018" offset="3119417">Has to make a kind of prima facie case, as it were which in (Inaudible) the Second Circuit did indicate citing some admiralty arbitrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.421" offset="3161004">The case whose name always remembers (Inaudible) because his name, that's citing a whole bunch of commercial arbitration precedents saying you have to go in and show some evidence of your claim on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.125" offset="3203845">And we think plainly that that's wrong, let's cut their hammer.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.965" offset="3215235">We think that's wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.215" offset="3220250">The Court is enforcing the agreement to arbitrate not the seniority provision, not the discharge provisions.</text>
