            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- that the 1790s or perhaps referred top those cases, the persons tried were not shown to have any kind of connection with the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.445" offset="181164">And of course these instances make understandable what is recorded in the chronicles of the times, the state of endemic conflict between the civil authorities and the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.206" offset="228185">Then between 1798 and 1858, we get from that 60-year mountain, mouse of seven trials of civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.243" offset="284296">In five of those seven instances, the Civil Courts were open in the vicinity so that I say that was flagrant disregard of proper boundaries and his history, not the kind of history infused in the Constitution, but the kind of history which consists of the recital of past abuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.925" offset="367052">We then come to the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.307" offset="380635">Judge Advocate General Holt, whose peculiarly genius gave us the military commission for political opponents which was disposed of in the Milligan case and also that sad monument to passion the trial of the Lincoln conspirators which nobody really likes to mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.755" offset="482408">And then with the war over and Holt retired, the question arose in 1877 and then when the Attorney General momentarily lapsed and said “Civilian employees could be trailed by Court Martial,” it was the Judge Advocate General who rushed into the breach and reminded the civil power of the limitations on military authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.541" offset="585540">All those opinions are set forth in Appendix C and that same paradox, if the Court please, continues today.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.428" offset="617096">The strongest statement of the unconstitutionality of military trials of civilians in time of peace is in the pages of Winthrop, a man for -- who always a mature life was a professional soldier.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.289" offset="680521">And the most vehement arguments in favor of that jurisdiction are presented here in this Court (Inaudible) cases are the civil rights, division of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.984" offset="719287">In other words, the military man is anti-militarist and the civil rights division is anti-civil rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.109" offset="947806">Now, these discussions in 1877 are most interesting because they are really the most -- the first articulated and reasoned discussion of the constitutional problem and really they lasted for some time and they were followed shortly thereafter by the case of the post trader.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.450" offset="1021158">Now, the post trader was the successor to the supplement.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.299" offset="1036518">Winthrop who lived contemporaneously with both said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.519" offset="1053445">The statutes providing for the post trader purported to make him subject to the articles of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.633" offset="1077896">And so the question was asked if the Judge Advocate General, “Can the post trader be trailed by Court martial?”</text>
            <text syncTime="250.225" offset="1104227">And he held in an opinion that was published in three successive additions, ”No, there is no military jurisdiction over the post trader except in time of war on the actual theatre of the Indian War.”</text>
            <text syncTime="263.538" offset="1157517">Now that --</text>

            <text syncTime="266.516" offset="1169429">No, no more than was the Sutler.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.796" offset="1182595">He was an independent contractor who made his living selling goods to the soldiers.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.139" offset="1211956">In other words, he is the -- he is the direct successor of the Sutler who was mentioned in the articles way back.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.304" offset="1236616">Now, that ruling was first mentioned three-and-a-half years ago and finally -- finally three -- now, in the reply brief, the Government admits its acceptance and then you can see why it took him three-and-a-half years to formulate an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.408" offset="1297011">There isn't any answer and even what they say is directed not to what was published for three successive additions in print, but to an abstract in the archives.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.399" offset="1341001">And that is why basically I have said that I cannot take too seriously as an historical text they rather selective presentation made by my brother.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="325.849" offset="1406725">Mr. Wiener, does this matter come up at all during the regime of the general Crowder?</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="333.824" offset="1438699">Judge Advocate General Crowder went to Congress in 1916, and asked for the 2d jurisdiction and it's one of the great mysteries of that 1916 revision why he never mentioned Winthrop's opinion which had been on the books for 20 years saying it was on unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.936" offset="1523127">Why he never mentioned the opinions in the 1912 digest of opinions that it just been issued under his own supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.456" offset="1549145">That to me is the great mystery.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.289" offset="1556564">Now, looking at, he apparently proceeded on one articulated premise, namely this thieving quarter master clerk who got away on the second occupation of Kilburn.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.128" offset="1607868">That's what he had on his mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.669" offset="1614033">Insofar as I tried to extract these legal premises, he thought first that the Constitution stopped at the water's edge, that there were no constitutional protections overseas, which of course is law.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.333" offset="1664711">He also thought that the Fifth Amendment cases arising in the land of Naval forces was a source of military jurisdiction and while that did had judicial support at that time, it was of course exploded by talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.020" offset="1715493">And the -- the mystery of the Sixteenth Revision is why didn't -- if Crowder had said, “Well, I've looked into this gentlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.225" offset="1744227">I think that my distinguished predecessor Colonel Winthrop was wrong, I think this is alright for such and such reasons” then we'd be in a different situation, but it was never discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.262" offset="1784456">So then we come back to our starting point, namely that military jurisdiction is a question of status.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.194" offset="1812146">Without military status, there is no military jurisdiction in time of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.743" offset="1830327">Without military status, there is jurisdiction in time of war only in areas in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.417" offset="1857076">Now, on practical necessities, here again I think the Government's arguments would carry more weight if there were fewer omissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.038" offset="1891558">I think it's pretty well admitted that there hasn't been any attempt to restudy this problem beyond -- well, let's see if we can't get read the Covert limited and future litigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.652" offset="1945997">They haven't even plugged the very obvious gap which is that the espionage chapter of Title 18 of the code would not apply to a civilian employee in an overseas military headquarters committing espionage violations, that very obvious gap for which it could be thrown back and tried in a District Court in the First District in which he was found or brought, the espionage act would not cover, an act of espionage by an American civilian in an overseas military headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.176" offset="2068041">They haven't even plugged that yet and they haven't explained why it is that these civilians haven't been militarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.985" offset="2103359">Well, the Court of hearing show and the appropriation here is a budgetary reason and then take -- take this petitioner and his connection and the connection of his offences with the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.179" offset="2152051">He was found guilty he was charged with.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.039" offset="2163545">He pleaded guilty to the substance of seven sex offences.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.419" offset="2181099">If they'd been in the District of Columbia, the only area where Congress legislates the order of -- had a hearing under the Sexual Psychopath Act, he would be placed in Saint Elizabeth.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.533" offset="2221537">Instead of which, he is trailed by Court Martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.967" offset="2231254">He is sentenced to five years confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.179" offset="2240136">It isn't going to cure him and it isn't going to protect society and here was an employee who are -- an auditor who offered to resign.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.881" offset="2270856">Now, what is an auditor so significantly got to do with our military mission?</text>
            <text syncTime="548.777" offset="2298441">Again, the Gerard case, if it was proper to turn Gerard over to the Japanese, why isn't so improper to turn this person over to the German Courts in Berlin?</text>
            <text syncTime="560.270" offset="2344417">We certainly trust the German Courts and we could have authorized them to handle this.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.581" offset="2369703">Now, I don't have to spend time on the proposition that necessity is not a constitutional argument, but here they haven't even made a showing of necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.220" offset="2416201">It is expediency and it's the expediency of doing things on the cheap, because it would cost less money to have these persons as civilians when they have them in the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.573" offset="2457684">And I submit that is not a sound ground for cutting down constitutional protections or for watering down the scope the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.089" offset="2491747">And from this it follows, if the Court please, that the judgment below refusing to release this petitioner to be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="610.632" offset="2545873">Colonel Wiener stated that the offense itself, the substantive offences would be or might be different if charged under the law of war than charged under the uniform code.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.339" offset="2584743">I don't think that's quite true.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.169" offset="2592057">The law of war recognizes as offences all those acts which are condemned as criminal by all -- by civilized nations generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.915" offset="2643048">Now, these particular offences fall in that category because all 50 states of the union and about 15 or 20 countries that -- that we have researched condemn this type of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.454" offset="2697174">So, it's clear the offence is one under the law of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.806" offset="2710549">Now how the offence would be charged is -- is a procedural question.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.859" offset="2730820">It can be charged in one or three ways under the law of nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.159" offset="2743986">It can be charged either particularized in terms of the local criminal code or it can be particularized the (Voice Overlap) --</text>
