            <text syncTime="82.560" offset="433612">First of this is the question of classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.769" offset="458480">The State of Texas attempts to justify the peculiar application of this statute to lessees of the United States from the ground that this is a matter of classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.276" offset="520443">Now, it is true that taxing authorities are given a good deal of latitude in making classifications among taxpayers in assessing different taxpayers at different rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.462" offset="577181">And there's no reason why reasonable classifications shouldn't apply to the United States or lessees of the United States rather when they're taxpayers as well as to anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.589" offset="625768">But as applied to this case, it -- it really doesn't -- it really doesn't help them because when their arguments are sifted down to the -- to the rock bottom, we find that the -- really the basis for classification that they would -- would apply in this case is that the United States is exempt from taxation and therefore, they cannot tax the lessor and therefore, it's a reasonable classification to tax the lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.416" offset="749066">Well, this -- this really is not -- it doesn't make any sense as a matter of classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.360" offset="764844">It's merely another way of saying that the United States is exempted and we have to get around it in some way in it -- a way of destroying the -- destroying the -- the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.214" offset="812178">In other words, as they would use the term “classification” and saying that we can discriminate without any -- without any basis other than a -- a basis that otherwise would not be able to raise our revenues.</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="458.802" offset="1938578">Well, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.603" offset="1941817">That -- that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.681" offset="1958118">The -- the other thing that I must mention is whether or not the United States has given permission to this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.693" offset="1986121">The State of Texas School District rely upon Section 6 of the Military Leasing Act as a specific permission from Congress that this type of tax should be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.832" offset="2042650">And I think that we must look at this section which appears at page 15 of the Government's brief amicus.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.678" offset="2086118">Section 6 of the Military Leasing Act, and it was under this Act that this lease was made, provides in the first sentence, the lease -- “The lessees' interest made or created pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be made subject to state or local taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.239" offset="2156335">And the State relies upon this as state -- as ground for saying that Congress has agreed to the type of tax which is involved in this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="523.533" offset="2197504">Now, I think there are two answers to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.106" offset="2207848">The first is that if you read Section 6 as a whole, you will find that the section, the second section states that in the event that Congress shall agree that the property as such is to be taxable by the State, then the lease made pursuant to this Act shall be subject to renegotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.045" offset="2295515">Now, that was put in there because at the time the Act was passed, there was a strong movement in Congress to subject federal leased property to state taxation as though it were owned by the -- by the lessees, and there were at least 17 bills pending, and there was probability of likelihood that some of them would be passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.727" offset="2382242">And if they were passed, Congress felt that then the lessees should be in a position to renegotiate with the United States and under that -- that rentals be adjusted in order to take care of the additional burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.080" offset="2435741">Now, when you read this Section then in connection with the first sentence, it doesn't make sense to say that the first sentence was this very kind of permission which they are dealing with in the second sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.374" offset="2488822">And that means that the first sentence must mean that Congress was consenting to the kind of taxation which indeed had occurred in Texas before this, taxation of the leasehold under circumstances where the leasehold -- the lessees from the United States were taxed in the same manner as the lessees from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.576" offset="2569697">And we believe that that is what -- if you -- if you read the -- the hearings, the -- the committee hearings and the reports, I think that's -- you will conclude that first sentence means.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.393" offset="2616926">If so, it isn't a consent to the kind of taxation which is tried to -- which is attempted to be imposed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.774" offset="2666454">No one is -- is more conscious of the -- the problems of the interrelationship of taxes between the States and the Federal Government than Congress and Defense Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.408" offset="2720998">These are the problems that -- that are very serious, they're very -- they're very real in the sense that there are federally impacted areas where the States are not in a position to raise the taxes from the federal property in order to carry out their -- their municipal problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.773" offset="2798425">School is a -- is a prime example.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.365" offset="2816815">So this is -- it's -- it's a real problem from the point of view of the States as well as from the point of view of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.274" offset="2852446">And Congress has, in part, attempted to deal with this through legislations, specific legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.897" offset="2882957">Special grants in aid of education are made in order to take care of that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.684" offset="2906154">And in this very situation in Texas that we're dealing with, the Dumas School District has applied for and has received grants to aid education to the extent of about $200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.914" offset="2959026">That appears in detail in -- in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="749.903" offset="3103013">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.408" offset="3120985">It is quite obvious from the argument that has gone before that the principal question in this case is the question of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.817" offset="3166647">I will proceed immediately to attack that question in, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.391" offset="3188903">But first, I would like to say that this Court has been subjected thus far to this sort of a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.824" offset="3238640">Counsel for appellant and for the United States have placed upon appellant a label as federal lessee and has attempted to place upon all others using and occupying exempt property for profit, a lessee -- a label as lessee of other exempt property, and has attempted to say that before a tax can avoid the label of discrimination that it must be a tax which bears equally upon all lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.727" offset="3402271">We submit that this label is not necessarily adequate that it, in itself, constitutes a form of discrimination because there are other users and occupiers with the exempt property than lessees, and there are situations where the label of lessees of federal property and other lessees is inadequate from a real and practical standpoint because another label may well be applied to appellant here and that is the label of one who uses and occupies for profit and for its own benefit, property which is exempt from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.528" offset="3589517">They have also used the label of discrimination in every instance to speak of distinction and tax treatment which is not necessarily the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.021" offset="3635493">We propose to attack this argument in two ways, first, by pointing out that under the decision of this Court last year in the Borg-Warner case and in a -- to a lesser degree in the Continental Motors and Murray cases decided on the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.469" offset="3701217">That the situation in Texas as presented by our statute when construed in context with other taxing statutes of the State is essentially identical to the situation presented in Michigan and the Borg-Warner case in which I have received the approval of this Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Earnest L. Langley</label>
            <text syncTime="941.600" offset="3869759">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.590" offset="3877700">First in, I would like to read the Michigan statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.293" offset="3900583">I apologize to the Court for not having this printed in a form where it can be followed verbatim, but in the brief for appellee it is substantially set forth at page 28 at the first paragraph, which I must not rely upon, but will read the statute itself to show that, in fact, the Michigan statute is not a statute which pertains to all lessees of exempt property.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.162" offset="4036002">The statute has, as it will be demonstrated, three broad exemptions from its operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.213" offset="4064214">The Act, and I'm reading from the margin of the opinion of this Court in the Borg-Warner case, “When any real property which for any reason is exempt from taxation as leased, loaned or otherwise made available to and used by private individual association or corporation in connection with their business conducted for profit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.876" offset="4138924">Now, that is essentially the requirement of the tax statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.467" offset="4153240">That is the use of exempt property for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.771" offset="4166405">The Texas statute purports to pertain only to property of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.474" offset="4189288">This purports to pertain to any real property, any reason exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.184" offset="4212067">Then the first exception is found except, and this is quoted verbatim in my brief at page 28, “Except where the use is by way of a concession in or relative to the use of a public airport, park, market, playground or a similar property, which is available to the use of the general problem.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.883" offset="4306944">That's the first broad exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.731" offset="4318333">Then it provides “shall be subject to taxation in the same amount and to the same extent as though the lessee or the user were the owner of such property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.433" offset="4353128">And then, by way of proviso, two additional exceptions, first, the only one that was actually mentioned and adverted to by this Court in its opinions under the Michigan cases that “the foregoing shall not apply to federal property for which payments are made in lieu of taxes and amounts equivalent to taxes which might otherwise be lawfully assessed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.610" offset="4441840">That's the second exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.971" offset="4447274">The third exception, “or a property of any State supported educational institution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.375" offset="4480920">That is the Michigan statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.060" offset="4495653">There are other statutes in the State of Michigan too not mentioned by this Court in its opinion but mentioned by the Supreme Court of Michigan in its opinion particularly in the Muskegon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.569" offset="4545599">That statute is the one in Section 7.3 of the Michigan statute annotated which provides that a person in possession of property maybe called upon to pay the taxes thereon, essentially the same as the one used in the Murray case except applicable as well to real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.212" offset="4624175">And then 7.9 (5) of the Michigan statute, which provides that when a tenant or other person in possession of property is called upon to pay the tax thereon, they're entitled to deduct the same from the rent, unless otherwise provided by contract with their landlord.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.379" offset="4696900">Now, the argument was made by Continental Motors in the Supreme Court of Michigan that these statutes meant that any lessee of exempt property in Michigan other than a lessee from the Federal Government will thereby be entitled to recover by these statutes from the landlord, and that this, in itself, meant that the Michigan statute was directed solely to federal lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.241" offset="4800345">That argument was deemed immaterial by the Michigan Supreme Court in view of the overriding importance of the basis for classification of property which will be adverted to at the second point in this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.895" offset="4862934">Now, then, that is the Michigan situation that has been approved by this Court only last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.262" offset="4888430">What then is the situation in Texas?</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.760" offset="4898461">The Texas statute itself which we are discussing now purports to apply only to federal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.036" offset="4927509">But there are three types of exempt property generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.016" offset="4939421">They may be classified as such, property of the Federal Government which is not exempt actually but is immune, property of State in local subdivisions of Government and property of private owners where the property is devoted to some such public use that it is deemed unworthy of exemption from taxation, property of church and charitable institutions and other organizations such as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.539" offset="5041507">Now, in Texas by the clear reading of the Constitution and statutes, all property of exempt organizations other than governmental loses its exemption entirely when devoted to a private use or when devoted to a use for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.570" offset="5109635">Therefore, we may eliminate from considerations that privately owned exempt property not because the lessee has to pay taxes on it because, of course, the lessee does not, but the owner will pay taxes on it and presumably that lessee will pay taxes in the guise of increased rent to a tax paying landlord.</text>

            <text syncTime="1280.411" offset="5224991">The -- every provision for exemptions specifically limits the use to which it maybe made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.144" offset="5247979">The cases decided and the Constitution and statutes are clear in that regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1294.657" offset="5282043">That leaves us then with the -- a State and local government property and the federal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.567" offset="5305657">Looking then at what happens to State and local property, we find that much of it is also taxable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1351.063" offset="5507636">Much State and local property is also subject to taxation in full or in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.550" offset="5533550">In the first place, the exemption from taxation of state and local property is limited to state and local property owned and held for a public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.305" offset="5576600">Our State cases, many of which are cited in our briefs, hold that when the public purpose is abandoned that the property becomes subject to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.846" offset="5614738">To be perfectly candid with the Court, our courts have been regulable in the interpretation of public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.112" offset="5639816">I would not say that this particular purpose in which the Dumas School District is attempting to tax Phillips Chemical Company would not be considered a public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.691" offset="5678164">I'm sure that it would, If this property were owned by the State of Texas, it would be a public purpose because the rents would be devoted to public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.659" offset="5710033">Yet, nevertheless, that is a limitation upon the exemption of state and local property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.080" offset="5731662">Certain other property -- and by and large, this property pertains to property that is held not for a governmental purpose but for some ancillary purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.378" offset="5776906">Much of our state property is specifically by statute made subject to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.903" offset="5794983">For example, our county school lands, they are made taxable for a certain purpose, it's limited, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.888" offset="5822882">Not all taxation on county school lands, the counties don't tax themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.243" offset="5840332">The schools don't tax the county school lands, but they are subject to some taxation because they are a broad class of property and are ordinarily devoted to leasing to private persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.900" offset="5886934">As well the lands of the University of Texas are subject to county taxation, because they -- again, they are ordinarily leased.</text>

            <text syncTime="1954.886" offset="7922918">They have, for example, at page 29 of their brief, as appellant in this case, “although Texas and its political subdivisions may not hold industrial plants reserved for national defense, the State and its agencies do own and lease properties of even greater value.</text>

            <text syncTime="2048.936" offset="8299081">Not examples of evidence showing that, in fact, there is discrimination or that there is taxation, but rather examples of Texas statutes authorizing leasing of Government property which they would say is exempt from taxation and therefore reflects discrimination against the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.686" offset="8382151">Let's examine those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.862" offset="8390823">The first two are essentially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.893" offset="8398973">Their provisions are very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.360" offset="8408795">One said airports and airport facilities, the other said airport property including such lands and improvements necessary to assemble or manufacture military and naval aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.447" offset="8449128">On yesterday, Mr. Davis stated that the State of Texas is authorized to lease to private persons for the purpose of manufacturing military and naval aircraft lands of the state airports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.536" offset="8497507">Your Honors, it's quite obvious that Mr. Davis has not read that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.192" offset="8512136">That statute provides that lands and improvements necessary to assemble or manufacturer military and naval aircraft can be leased only to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.652" offset="8558007">That is a restriction contained in that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.395" offset="8568978">It is true that other airport property maybe leased in the way of concession but the statute specifically provides that it must not be such a use that will exclude the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.392" offset="8612968">That's what the Michigan statute says that the exemption is where it may be used by way of concession in or relative to the use of a public airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.560" offset="8649644">It's identical to the Michigan statute in that regard, not found in the same statute but found in the same statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.236" offset="8680364">That's the first example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.847" offset="8686738">The next is wharf, docks, warehouses, grain elevators, bunkering facilities, belt railroads and other harbor facilities under Article 8247 (a) (b) and (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.767" offset="8722474">First place, I might point out that (c), that subdivision does pertain to leases again to United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.666" offset="8746088">But the others -- the statute is restricted to what we call navigation districts in Texas, much lack perhaps before New York authority is something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.034" offset="8791542">Again, a concession type use, a use that is so large that perhaps no private industry had been found that is willing to operate it and such harbor as the Port of Houston, the Port of Galveston, Corpus Christi, Brownsville and perhaps other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.007" offset="8851414">I don't live on the coast and don't know about those things, but those things are interstate organizations, state instrumentalities that provide those public facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.721" offset="8898226">And these uses are by way of concession in or -- or use of with -- along with the general public these public facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.357" offset="8928841">That's all they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.776" offset="8934484">Again, they would be excluded under the Michigan statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.406" offset="8952978">Then municipal fish markets, including facilities for cleaning, canning, and cold storage of fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.557" offset="8973563">That article is well provides that in cities along the coast where they have fishing industry, that the city may provide for a public municipal fish market to be used by the public in general on a concession type arrangement and operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.736" offset="9038346">The State is not authorized nor any subdivision to build fish markets and lease them to people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.537" offset="9065514">The next one is, I guess, the most -- well, it's the oddest one of the bunch to be included here Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2468.573" offset="9977710">Presumably, that's the catchall for property in Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2676.942" offset="10811120">Two of these pertain to the leasing of property of a state-supported educational institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.361" offset="10840795">First one of them is Texas Tech at Lubbock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.218" offset="10852289">The next one is the University of Texas in Austin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.919" offset="10863052">Both of them are instrumentalities of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.365" offset="10872874">They are state-supported educational institutions and their property would be exempt from the operation of the Michigan statute as it is from the operation of the Texas statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.206" offset="10912162">There's no difference there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.087" offset="10919685">I might mention also that because it has already been brought into this argument and that is that this first opinion talks about Pantex.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.396" offset="10952913">We call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.838" offset="10954689">It's Pantex Ordnance Plant in -- in the Carson County, Texas over near Amarillo which was mentioned yesterday, I believe, both by Mr. Clifford and by Mr. Davis as being property where the State of Texas owns it and leases it and that it is a big ordnance plant too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.288" offset="11028564">Now, the -- we're outside the record on this of course, because we're talking about briefs and there was no evidence in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.263" offset="11056462">But I think this opinion shows in and of itself and it is a fact that Pantex Ordnance Plant was deeded to Texas Tech with a recapture clause shortly before the Korean War.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.554" offset="11109543">When the Korean War broke out, that recapture clause was exercised by the United States and the manufacturing and commercial facilities at Pantex Ordnance Plant were recaptured by the United States and are now being operated by the United States as a manufacturing plant for actual components for atomic bombs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.906" offset="11195016">They are being operated by Silas Mason Incorporated and Mason &amp; Hanger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.502" offset="11213406">That's -- that's what Pantex is except for that property which Texas Tech has around the fringes which include a few building, some of which are leased to our friends on the other side of the table, Phillips Chemical Company, as the opinion shows for storage purposes and the rest of which is used by Texas Tech for educational purposes with the exception of some grazing leases and some farming leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.968" offset="11307238">But whatever use is being made by Texas Tech in the way of leasing would be exempted under the Michigan statute as well as under the Texas statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3123.734" offset="12598314">It arose the because of a claim then being asserted that this and other similar properties in the State have become exempt or would become exempt within the near future by transfer of title thereto from RFC to the United States or some agency exempt from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.917" offset="12662993">The Act was passed to avoid the dissent or consequences upon the local units of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.807" offset="12690578">That was in the record in the Muskegon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.423" offset="12701027">Further, the record shows, I don't have the pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.776" offset="12714506">I borrowed under those briefs and things earlier and read some of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.904" offset="12731016">I don't recall exactly how much but that the record did show that there was very little actual taxation of any property other than federal under the Michigan statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.154" offset="12771976">The record in that case will reflect that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.905" offset="12782947">Thus, it seems to us that both by the reasoning of the Michigan statute and the Michigan cases and by the authority and the legal precedents of the Michigan cases, particularly Borg-Warner, that the Texas statute, there's no more guilty of discrimination against the Federal Government or those with whom it deals and was the Michigan statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.641" offset="12869987">And that -- for that reason, this case should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.806" offset="12882631">We pass then to the question of classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.978" offset="12903320">Assuming that there is a distinction and assuming that there is some difference between sthe Texas classification system as exemplified in each statutes, Article 5248 and the others which -- with which it must be considered, can there be a reasonable basis for those differences?</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.409" offset="12985031">Assuming arguendo that there are and they were not governed by the Michigan statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.026" offset="13007496">The rule for classification has been stated from the bench in this Court during argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.925" offset="13031111">Any classification for taxation is proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.595" offset="13041768">This Court has held in, perhaps, several hundred cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.294" offset="13060577">If any reasonable basis can be conceived for that difference in classification, a classification is not arbitrary, it's not discriminatory, it's not invidious, if some reasonable basis exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.551" offset="13117628">Further, there is a presumption of validity, this Court has said on many occasions which attaches to a state taxing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.126" offset="13147826">And the burden of proving the invalidity is upon the appellant in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3365.912" offset="13567039">And that what this Court has meant when it has said as it said in the Borg-Warner case that it still remains true as it has from the beginning that a tax classification maybe arbitrary and unreasonable and therefore void if it discriminates against the United States for those against or those with whom it deals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.622" offset="13637883">We are not talking about just pointing out federal lessees, but we're talking about discriminating against them, not distinguishing them or using a distinction in tax treatment but discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.570" offset="13693680">That is the key, it seems to me, to those statements found in the opinions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.997" offset="13715310">We're not talking about distinction, we're talking about actual discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.911" offset="13735058">And if the class of federal lessees or users and occupiers of federal property is based on reasonable grounds, it should be a valid classification.</text>

            <text syncTime="3420.941" offset="13787094">The only prohibition is against discrimination, not against classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.534" offset="13809560">There are examples of that in the opinions of this Court where the courts have held statutes obviously designed to tax the interest on Government bond, the income from copyrights, the income from patents and other rights where the obvious purpose was that, yet nevertheless because the classification was not deemed arbitrary or invidious, this taxing statute was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.443" offset="13921155">In fact then, is the classification adopted by the State of Texas here a reasonable classification?</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.631" offset="13957935">Is there a reasonable basis for it? If there is, then it seems to us that the tax statute is valid, that it does not rough out of any of the provisions of the Constitution which are the only limitations upon state taxing power and which this Court has said are not very broad limitations upon that power.</text>

            <text syncTime="4631.423" offset="18629047">Your Honor, I'll answer that this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.181" offset="18636048">I would say that ordinarily, as this Court has said in the past, that the incidence of a state levy or exaction is a question of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.090" offset="18675754">In this case, it has been decided adversely.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.227" offset="18684322">Now, we would say that the Court is not bound by that certainly, if the practical operation and effect is otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.116" offset="18715878">But examine the practical operation and effect of this tax, you'll find that it is not otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.557" offset="18737612">Now, we are not opinioned to the position that this tax has to be an ad valorem tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4664.491" offset="18761331">And I'd like to answer Mr. Clifford's argument in this respect where he says it -- only, a school district in Texas may levy, only an ad valorem tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.507" offset="18813367">And for authority for this, he quotes Article 7, Section 3 in his brief at page 41.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.371" offset="18844818">And he quotes this portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.131" offset="18851924">He says, “The legislature shall be authorized to pass laws for the assessment and collection of taxes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.671" offset="18878046">And all said districts, referring to school districts, and for the management and control of the public school or schools of such districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.068" offset="18903646">Now, here he has an omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4702.792" offset="18914513">There's an interjecting thought here that he does not put in and then he proceeds to say, “And the legislature may authorize an additional ad valorem tax to be levied and collected with our school districts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4714.800" offset="18962578">Now, there is your only reference in that section to ad valorem taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4719.134" offset="18979924">And I assume that -- that putting it this way that Mr. Clifford would like to rely upon the theory of Houston General.</text>
            <text syncTime="4727.170" offset="19012002">But I think he's sort of reversed the application of it here because here, the General precedes a specific and therefore, I don't believe there's any question of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4737.079" offset="19051708">If -- if there is any question of it, it's put to rest in another constitutional provision of the Texas Constitution which is Article 8, Section 17 which says that the enumeration of objects and subjects of taxation in the State Constitution shall not limit the legislature in their selection of subjects and objects for taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.994" offset="19151391">And if they deem it necessary, they can select other objects and subjects of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.704" offset="19170200">Consequently, I don't believe that there is any genuine question but that the state legislature could authorize the imposition of a use or privilege tax by the School District or any other subdivisions of the State of Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="4835.614" offset="19445844">You had it measured by exactly the same thing it is measured here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.976" offset="19463293">And further, in the Murray case, you'll remember, you didn't levy it under a general statute or an enabling statute, you levied the tax or they levied the tax under their general ad valorem tax structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.964" offset="19519195">And it was specifically defined an ad valorem tax and they were stuck with that in Michigan, but this Court found that that was no fatal defect, that the mere omission of the words that this shall be considered a use tax could be supplied whereas practical operation and effect were the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="5078.169" offset="20416031">There is certain basic proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5079.710" offset="20422196">First, privately owned tax-exempt property when leased for private purposes looses its exemption entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5088.582" offset="20457723">And I have laboriously set this forth in pages 7 through 20 of my brief and shown just where and in what respect, what cases held it and what constitutional limitations there was or on every part of privately owned tax-exempt property in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.530" offset="20521462">Therefore, I do not believe that we can consider privately owned tax-exempt property in relation to this question of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5112.726" offset="20554271">If there is any discrimination, it must be found from a different source or from the difference in tax payment between lessees of federally owned property and lessees of a different type of tax-exempt property other than privately owned tax-exempt property which leaves only state property.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.841" offset="20610696">Now, state property can be leased without loosing its exemption if, one, and the cases have construed the Constitution to mean this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5140.483" offset="20665344">The leasing is of a temporary nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.895" offset="20678928">Two, all revenues derived from the leasing and they're exclusively to the public benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5151.108" offset="20707767">And three that the public purpose of the property cannot be abandoned, and by that, they mean that there must be an eventual retaking of this property and devoting it to public purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.727" offset="20750294">Those are the limitations upon the leasing of state property.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.096" offset="20767744">Now, there is a great deal of state property, and Mr. Langley had described that property and I won't bother with it that is expressly made subject to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.336" offset="20800763">I'll describe it only as being the type that is actually characteristically available for leasing like the university property or county school lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.956" offset="20847156">And then there's -- is another proposition or it's the last proposition in this entire framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="5191.344" offset="20868786">We see the state property which is not expressly made subject to taxation and which is leased so as to preserve its exemption will be taxed to the lessee with the fair cash market value of the lease under Article 7173 and 7174 and I would assume that those statutes still apply, although I can see no other applicability of those two particular statutes to any property other than state property, which is leased so as to preserve its exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="5226.068" offset="21007653">Now, it is -- this -- this question of discrimination must be resolve in that light.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.618" offset="21029804">In other words, you got to consider whether or not the slight differentiation in actual tax or economic treatment of the two types of lessees is sufficient to vitiate the classification erected by the operation of Article 5248.</text>
            <text syncTime="5252.386" offset="21112874">And for that, we go to the ordinary rules of classification that this Court has devised, and that is, whether or not, there's any reasonable basis for the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="5262.346" offset="21152789">Whether or not, it is invidiously discriminatory or -- or probably arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.580" offset="21177657">Whether or not, it rests upon some basis having a fair and substantial relation even to the object of the legislation or to the public policy of the State, and the last requirement that I've been able to gleam from the cases is that all those similarly circumstance must be treated alike.</text>

            <label>Mr. Clark M. Clifford</label>
            <text syncTime="6486.944" offset="26051166">Please Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6489.134" offset="26059943">In the very few minutes I have before noon recess, I would like to direct the Court's attention to the question that this tax is a tax against federal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="6502.065" offset="26111666">First, we start with the language of the tax that Mr. Justice Whittaker has referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6508.221" offset="26136221">Any portion of federal lands leased to a private party shall be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6516.027" offset="26167463">That's the language in the substance of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6519.341" offset="26180733">Second, is this an ad valorem tax?</text>
            <text syncTime="6523.396" offset="26196929">The parties here in their briefs concede that this is an imposition of an ad valorem tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="6531.237" offset="26228276">On page 6 of the State of Texas brief, it says “This Court's opinion,” referring to the United States Supreme Court, “will seriously affect future ad valorem taxation by a great number of the county school districts and other taxing authorities of the State.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6550.921" offset="26307062">We have the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6553.254" offset="26316361">We have next that it is construed to be an ad valorem tax and third, if Your Honors please, we had in the transcript of the record on page 109, each of Your Honors has before it, page 109.</text>
            <text syncTime="6575.216" offset="26404237">We have the entry in the tax records of the Dumas Independent School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="6583.127" offset="26435897">It says here, “Owner, Phillips Chemical Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="6588.945" offset="26459199">Address, P.O. box,” and so forth, “Amarillo, Texas for assessment of taxes for the year 1953 by John R. Powell, assessor of Dumas Independent School District, Moore County, State of Texas.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6600.058" offset="26503607">Now, what is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="6601.614" offset="26509876">All of the following described realty commonly known as Cactus Ordnance Works including buildings, improvements, fixtures, machinery and the pertinencies thereto belonging and more particularly described as follows to wit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6616.924" offset="26571107">There's a clerk's note here follows approximately 10 pages of legal description of seven tracks of land, 23 easement areas being identical to the descriptions found in the lease from the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="6632.652" offset="26634010">We would like to suggest that when the refuge has to be made that the -- the language here is not perhaps what they intended to say but that some construction will be put upon it, I say that the language as it appears seems clear, it is at no place described as a use tax in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6658.429" offset="26737037">We know that it is an ad valorem tax, the briefs are replete with reference to the ad valorem tax and then we finally come down to the entry in the tax records and what has taxed the Cactus Ordnance Works including all of the realty, all of the pertinencies, all of the machinery and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="6678.855" offset="26818748">What do you say to the State's argument that the decisions of last year about little breath of light now again?</text>

            <text syncTime="6687.075" offset="26851662">I would say with reference to that, that this Court distinguished Allegheny from the so-called Michigan cases because they said that in the Allegheny case, there was no ruling there as to whether a tax, a use or occupation tax, would be valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="6709.030" offset="26939538">What the Court did say in the Allegheny tax -- Allegheny case was when federal property in the possession of a lessee is taxed that even though the tax is directed to the lessee that is an invalid tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="6730.695" offset="27026160">And as I recall, the Master Machine Works had machinery of the Federal Government in its plant and the tax was levied upon other property of Master Machine Works and that machinery that was included in.</text>
            <text syncTime="6746.636" offset="27089899">And when the tax bill came in, the objection was made that they owed no tax on the federal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="6753.551" offset="27117589">The tax in that case was not the bill, it was not sent to the Federal Government, it was sent to the -- to the Master Machine Works.</text>
            <text syncTime="6761.221" offset="27148204">And this Court held that the Master Machine Works didn't have to pay any tax on that and that particular effort was invalid and illegal, because it affects a tax to federal property that was in the possession of the Master Machine Works.</text>
            <text syncTime="6778.079" offset="27215705">And in this instance, this is federal property in the hands of the Phillips but it's still federal property and the tax attached to it.</text>
