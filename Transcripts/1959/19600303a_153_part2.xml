            <text syncTime="288.530" offset="1257514">And we think this is a more just wording in the statute because of the background of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.860" offset="1286771">This statute which was inaugurated by the judicial conference because of the problems in habeas corpus had a long history of committee reports and conference reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.419" offset="1361063">Now, we have attached part of this to our brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.488" offset="1373288">The whole of the act was considered in United States versus Hayman.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.693" offset="1394186">So for our purposes, I would -- I'd just narrowly considered just this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.421" offset="1425011">At the very first hearing of the committee, this is before it got to the judicial context, the habeas corpus committee, this language read claiming that the judgment is void, claiming that the judgment is void, in that context, this particular action here would have been cognizable.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.158" offset="1516022">We think it is significant that before it was even submitted to the judicial conference, before that, this wording was deliberately changed to the wording we now find in the statute namely claiming the right to be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.601" offset="1593762">Now we think it is clear why it was changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.855" offset="1610794">It is because the habeas corpus committee and the judicial conference were truly concerned with the habeas corpus problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.990" offset="1647365">Habeas corpus has traditionally and always been utilized only and solely when a person can claim the right to be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.925" offset="1703058">And this was one of the problems, for example in McNally versus Hill where they -- the petitioner claimed the -- some parole rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.953" offset="1739212">At that time, this Court went into the problem of habeas corpus and concluded that habeas corpus as a remedy had never been used, had never been used anytime other than when a person can claim the right to be released.</text>

            <text syncTime="805.386" offset="3324949">If he wants to be heard on something outside the eastern -- of the facts outside the Eastern District then we have certainly muddled the whole 2255 problem because that's exactly what we had 2255 to avoid, was this problem of getting things from outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.086" offset="3395688">As I say that we -- we think both the language, the background of this statute and the cases that have followed it have all been consistent in holding that in these circumstances this statute is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.949" offset="3463189">May I spend a few moments on the second question which we do not really believe is reached, the question is, assume we have only a 12-year sentence, assume that is the only one so that we don't get into the other problems, has this petitioner raised the question sufficiently to grant him a hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="864.663" offset="3562036">We think it is significant that of the two facets of this problem, one of the things that he has said was that the Court originally denied him the right to withdraw his plea because he says in his petition that he knew at that time that he had been, as he used the word, tricked, tricked.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.702" offset="3650226">Now we suggest this means that this petitioner knew of his remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.158" offset="3671960">As a matter of fact, he had a lawyer at that time which he has never said anything about.</text>

            <text syncTime="900.049" offset="3703620">He was told by the Court that the Court could give him the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.428" offset="3725040">He -- two days after this sentence, he did attack the Southern District and he did not attack the Eastern District at all so that he -- here is a man who knew if we -- if we believe his allegations, knew of something which he says is wrong and has deliberately not done anything about it and we suggest that it's -- it's clear why because he didn't get a maximum sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.869" offset="3830888">He got only a concurrent sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.364" offset="3836844">He got a problem which was not going to interfere with him in the least.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.998" offset="3855339">Now we think that is the part at least of the problem on the merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.954" offset="3871222">The other part of course is that there is a clear record in the Eastern District of New York showing that he was warned.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.864" offset="3902777">Number one, showing in that the Court told him that the Court could enter the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.312" offset="3924616">If we are to disregard all of these safeguards, I suppose it's true, then.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.247" offset="3948335">It is not just because he had an attorney as we would, but all of this were -- and he doesn't challenge this by the way in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.393" offset="3964949">He doesn't challenge any of these record facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.562" offset="3977592">He merely says that the Assistant United States Attorney said that she would ask for a light sentence and she did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.135" offset="4015940">It's nowhere alleged that she promised him a light sentence, but -- that she would ask for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.469" offset="4037256">As a result, we feel first in summary that this petitioner is entitled to no relief on any circumstances regardless of the statutory problem because of the general policy of not deciding this type of problem where this is no -- no benefit at all can result to this that this particular statute as grafted and as interpreted and for its purpose is not applicable to this type of problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.111" offset="4163793">And that finally, on the merit, he has not really alleged sufficient grounds to entitle him to a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1037.042" offset="4251564">You must remember this man's in the Leavenworth penitentiary, he is a colored man.</text>

            <text syncTime="1046.125" offset="4287822">He reads these books in the library so many hours in evening and he has educated himself through all these proceedings and it (Inaudible) who's in the Government in my opinion to hold him to strict lines of procedural matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.514" offset="4345396">He is entitled to the benefit of -- of some leniency here, like the courts to give him a habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.979" offset="4371310">Now, this question of this statute sees him claiming the right to be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.041" offset="4399522">This statute -- the Court is applying habeas corpus under McNally verse Hill that you must show the right to be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.992" offset="4431391">This just says claiming a right to be released.</text>

            <text syncTime="1100.015" offset="4503385">And this statute then says that findings of fact and conclusions of law should be made and then when you come up through your Circuit and through your District Court or some court has made findings of fact and conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.275" offset="4564511">Now in the government's brief, they say he'd be entitled to no relief on parole, on good time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.739" offset="4594291">Well, who's deciding all these things whether he's entitled to any of these things because the man has never had a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.171" offset="4620100">Does the Court when it gets one of these motions have to go through the record write to United States Attorney and say, “Now, if we granted this, would this affect this man's parole rights on the -- on the second sentence?</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.302" offset="4672554">Would it affect this good time rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.575" offset="4681644">You're having a hearing without the man being present because you're asking the Court to make all these decisions and there's no finding of fact, no conclusions of law, no hearing as this statute says a judicial hearing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.704" offset="4734203">Now, in the concurring opinion, this Court in the Heplin case, the Court says that they don't leave the majority concurrent opinion that this question hearing at anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.600" offset="4785821">All they say is -- that that means res judicata doesn't apply or latches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.119" offset="4807868">Well, if the Congress intended that that was what they meant, why didn't they say it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.779" offset="4826467">Why did they say a hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.677" offset="4834095">Why do they use the word hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.411" offset="4849037">In the Hayman case, the Court says, “This is purely a statute to afford the man the same right he had in habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.678" offset="4886131">In another section of the Hayman case, they say, “This is an independent action, collateral attack on the judgment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.555" offset="4921553">So if it is, now the question he says here about this man claiming he's -- he has denied the right to withdraw his motion, his plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.388" offset="4956975">He went in to the Eastern District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.042" offset="4967528">He filed the motion and he asked to withdraw he plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.423" offset="4981112">The Court never heard a word of testimony. The man never got to open his mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.980" offset="4999293">It was denied arbitrarily from the bench and true that that is the matter ordinarily you have to raise by appeal and it's the discretion -- that is the Court, but the abuse of a Court as to discretion is a matter you can reach and hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.336" offset="5068675">We have a statute that says -- 2255 says that a court on -- under 2255 can grant a motion for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.608" offset="5105768">But what does it mean that it can grant a motion for a new trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.990" offset="5119352">Does it mean that the old theory that you had to appeal or what is it a new trial granted?</text>
