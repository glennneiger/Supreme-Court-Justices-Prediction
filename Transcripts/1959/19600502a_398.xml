            <text syncTime="40.626" offset="265906">On Friday of this last week, the United States filed with this Court, a memorandum describing action by the Congress that we think has a very important bearing on this case and removes some of the problems otherwise involved in the case before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.888" offset="370918">I'd like very briefly to call your attention to that memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.810" offset="394637">It refers to the action of the Congress in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.045" offset="423581">That Act has not yet been signed by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.812" offset="442598">The United States believe that it will be within a short time.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="91.533" stopTime="385.472">
            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="91.533" offset="469556">I think it was up on the Fifth or I think by the Sixth, we will know about the action of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.269" offset="512397">And United States is willing to rely upon the assumption that it will be signed and that the Court should examine the case in the light of that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.543" offset="565582">Now, that Civil Rights Act of 1960 is an amendment of the 1957 Act that was involved in this proceeding up to the time that we filed this memorandum and I think that it would govern the -- this proceeding hereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.294" offset="652518">As the Court will recall, it has held several times that since this in an -- an action for declaratory relief and injunctive relief, it is prospective in regard to the effect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.795" offset="722526">And therefore, there is no problem about what the law was at the time this case was before the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.198" offset="752201">It is a question of what the law is at the time it is brought back and tried before that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.142" offset="783966">And the court has also held that the mere fact that there are facts that have -- relating to acts that have occurred prior to the passage of the legislation does not make it retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.526" offset="845511">The Reynolds case and Cox against Hart are both cases that bear upon that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.248" offset="868394">So that the Court would properly, in examining this in the trial of this proceeding before the lower court, take into account assuming that this Act is passed, this amendment, the Civil Rights Act of 1960 would take as an amendment of the 1957 Act and try to determine what the law is with regard to the powers of the United States to bring such a proceeding in that condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.718" offset="990229">Now, the 1960 act is very explicit in regard to the power of the United States Attorney General to bring such an action as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.881" offset="1034846">We have set it out on page 2 of our memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.825" offset="1062640">“The act or practice shall also be deemed that of the State and the State may be joined as a party defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.820" offset="1094614">And if prior to the institution of such a proceeding, such official has resigned, or has been -- been relieved of his office and no successor has assumed such office, the proceeding may be instituted against the State.”</text>
            <text syncTime="260.017" offset="1143411">So, in this case, under the facts here, there would be two separate grounds for making the State a party, one, the absolute power to make the State a party and the other the power to make the State a party whenever the officer has resigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.273" offset="1212479">The parties, Rogers and Livingston, have both resigned in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.008" offset="1231391">And so, it would come under both provisions of that portion of the amendment to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.881" offset="1270888">We do have one further aspect of the case and that is the fact that the lower court dismissed the action as to all parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.370" offset="1304848">And the United States made the Board of Registrars a party and also Rogers and Livingston, the two individuals, who were registrars and had resigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.068" offset="1355630">Though that question, we regard as a difficult question, we think the United States is right about it and we've developed it at length in our original brief, but we do not think the Court has to reach that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.333" offset="1404740">In light of the Civil Rights Act of 1960, assuming it is signed because we think that the Court should assume and the United States is willing to assume that with the State as a party, thus a state will comply with any final order that the Court enters in such a proceeding in regard to these most important rights of citizens to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.815" offset="1522604">And therefore, we suggest that the Court need not reach the question of the individuals in this case and the effect of their resignations and that the Court can properly find that the State under the amended statute, would be a proper party and that the Court at -- would at the time the case is returned to have the power to take jurisdiction of a proceeding against the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="874.001" offset="3599339">We came to prepare to argue with two different parts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.960" offset="3631208">One related to the right of the United States to sue the respondent, Rogers and Livingston who at that time the suit was filed had resigned under Alabama law, had resigned under the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.458" offset="3709158">Their resignations had been accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.790" offset="3722533">They had accepted other officers of profit under the State and that part of the argument had fallen to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.734" offset="3762343">The other part of the argument was to be presented by Mr. Hare, Assistant Attorney General of Alabama which dealt with the right of the United States on the 1957 Civil Rights Act to bring a suit against the State of Alabama, more specifically, whether a District Court had jurisdiction of such a suit under the 1957 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.647" offset="3877909">Now, Mr. Rankin's secretary called our office on Friday and relayed to me the substance of a memorandum or note which he has written to the Court, as they had to learn you could do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.718" offset="3942275">And we were furnished with a copy when we arrive here, Sunday afternoon, at our hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.870" offset="3970800">And in order to properly analyze the ramifications of what we might do here today in this argument or what we might agree to on the assumption that the President will sign the law, I believe he will.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.656" offset="4030046">But as of today, it is not law and we don't know what he will do.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.281" offset="4056482">So far as -- as that the Court will bear with me a few minutes, I would like to point out because I don't know what you all will do, will you with agree the Solicitor General, which of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="999.535" offset="4101517">That under the statutes of Alabama, that all officers where they may hold office or shall hold office or not, have the right to vacate those offices by resignation, the statute set forth in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.243" offset="4160345">Now, a little difference for the common law in that that there has to be no acceptance by the appointing authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.091" offset="4191692">But here in this case, there wasn't acceptance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.324" offset="4200678">So, even the Alabama law and the common law has -- has been complied with by the acceptance of those resignations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.330" offset="4236727">And in addition thereto, the very statute which permits their appointment and which says that they may hold office as Registrars for a period of four years until their successors are elected and qualified, substance of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.195" offset="4296182">Also provides that they may be removed at anytime for any cause by the appointing authority which the Governor, state auditor and the Commission of Agriculture and Industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.441" offset="4337142">Attached to these pleadings and to our motion to dismiss and to a motion which we filed -- our answer we filed in response to a motion to produce certain records is in affidavit by each of the respondents, one, Rogers and the other, Livingston in which it set forth all the facts to show that they did resign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.734" offset="4422301">The resignations were in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.658" offset="4430033">They accepted, by the proper authority that a -- in addition had been removed from office by those appointing authorities or authority and had assumed other offices of profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.281" offset="4480502">And under the Constitution and laws of the State of Alabama both, you are prohibited from holding two offices of profit on the State at one in the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.903" offset="4523029">Now, there had been some suggestion in the brief about that the resignations were made in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.786" offset="4542568">There's nothing like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.367" offset="4548838">The whole argument was based on the assumption that they did not become effective until the appointment of their successors or -- or resignation --</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.434" offset="6433102">If this case, this argument and the case itself has -- if not become moot has become one of limited importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.354" offset="6476779">Because assuming that the new law will come into effect, they will travel under the new law, some aspects of the new law which were entirely different from the old like the referee, the referee section which enables the District Court to appoint referees to oversee voting registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.925" offset="6571029">Now, that in itself might make it inappropriate to take such an unusual step as enjoining a State in a governmental function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.124" offset="6611884">It may not be necessary to enjoin a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.209" offset="6624214">And the only prayer in the present bill is a prayer for an injunction which apparently has mandatory injunction effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.506" offset="6661413">But it's not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.573" offset="6665697">It won't be necessary under the new bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.533" offset="6673533">They can -- they can get all the relief they want by the voter registrar section of the new bill.So the point of it is, there are so many things to be considered that it -- it seems to me like this Court could well say that due to the intervening circumstance, that is a passage of this law, and due to the present limited, very limited importance of this particular case because it couldn't affect another case anywhere in the United States anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.129" offset="6795891">Because of -- assuming the new act will pass, whether or not the State under the 1957 Amendment could be made a party would never arise again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.546" offset="6845524">So I say due to this limited importance now, the Court should exercise its discretion as it has done many times in the past and in particular, the case which my associate mentioned, Rice versus Sioux City Cemetery where they said, “Due to the isolated significance of this particular piece of litigation, the writ of certiorari was deemed to be improvidently granted and the writ was denied.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2066.496" offset="8369403">And as soon as it was passed by the Congress and we had reason to believe that the President would sign it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.313" offset="8400645">Then it seemed to me it was the duty of our office and also counsel on the other side should be considering the matter to see if they could advise this Court as to how the matter should be disposed of in -- in the light of those events.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.257" offset="8456443">Because it had changed the situation so materially that this Court should not have to be burdened with an examination of a situation that was so materially changed that it wasn't the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.611" offset="8501791">And in light of that, while we could only file it when we did on Friday, we were considering the matter earlier as soon as the Congress had acted and I would think counsel on the other side should too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.675" offset="8550066">And with the constitutional questions and all of the rest of it left to the trial, the only thing we ask the Court to do now is to say what the Court has done before in the past, no factual problem about it all, does this statute or does it not say that a State can be made a party in such a proceeding?</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.180" offset="8644106">And we shouldn't have to face another appeal and delay in regard to the problem of that simplicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.132" offset="8671901">I don't think that if counsel were just given many weeks, he could figure out many arguments as to whether the statute does or does not say that very thing and that's all we ask.</text>
