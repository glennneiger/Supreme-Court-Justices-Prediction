            <text syncTime="19.624" offset="181896">This case presents for review, two judgments of the Police Court of Louisville, adjudicating the petitioner to be guilty of violating two City of Louisville ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.053" offset="247620">These ordinances proscribe -- prescribe penalties -- criminal penalties for loitering and disorderly conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.624" offset="289834">The case comes here directly from the Police Court of Louisville, because it happens that that is the highest court of Kentucky and which a decision on the merits of the case can be held.</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="67.782" offset="374471">There is no power in the Court -- intermediate Court of Appeals to hear this under any circumstances?</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Lusky</label>
            <text syncTime="73.464" offset="397249">There is no intermediate Court of Appeals in Kentucky at all, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.898" offset="418983">And the exact statutory situation is that judgments of the Police Court of Louisville are not appealable unless they involve a fine of at least $20 or a jail sentence of more than 10 days, or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.135" offset="519920">It is also clear, under the Kentucky decisions, that even the extraordinary power possessed by the Kentucky Court of Appeals to exercise control over inferior jurisdictions under Section 110 of the Kentucky Constitution, which is a kind of an all writs section, that even this power is not available despite the existence of timely and substantial federal constitutional claims where, as in this case, the sentence is unappealable because of its smallness.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.069" offset="683656">In other words, the Kentucky Court of Appeals has squarely held that where a $10 fine is involved and where the fine is unappealable on the merits because it is so small, that the Court of Appeals will consider the injustice to be too small to justify the invocation of relief under the All Writs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.550" offset="789608">The cases for that are cited in our brief, Walters against Fowler, Thompson against Wood.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.612" offset="813850">And actually, a proceeding collateral to this case and which it was also reaffirmed, which I will describe if you'd like to hear it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.252" offset="860348">It's -- I mean, our -- we had a problem on this case in -- in this rather peculiar way.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.254" offset="888351">It was clear enough that this was the -- that -- that since these cases were -- involved sentences too small to take any Kentucky court, this was the only court that they could be taken to.But it was also unfortunately true that under Kentucky law, there is no provision for bail, unless you are taking an appeal to a state court, no statutory provisions for bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.599" offset="997752">Third, it was true under Kentucky law that there was -- that -- that whether you want to or not, if you're put in the Louisville workhouse in default of paying a fine, you automatically get credit on your fine at the rate of $2 a day for everyday you spend in the workhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.525" offset="1093465">This petitioner has two $10 fines and that meant that -- that at the end of 10 days, whether he wanted to or not, he would've paid those fines by being in the workhouse for 10 days and the case would be moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.125" offset="1143829">So, for that reason, desiring to file a petition for certiorari in this Court and knowing that this Court -- it's hard even to write a petition for -- in 10 days, much less get it ruled on.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.689" offset="1198164">We had to initiate collateral proceedings in order to get him out of jail, long enough so that we could get a petition for certiorari filed here and we -- we did file a habeas corpus proceeding in the State Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.556" offset="1261589">Habeas corpus was granted on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.511" offset="1273396">There was no statutory provision for it, but Judge Lawrence Grauman of the Jefferson Circuit Court held that if he had a federal constitutional claim and a substantial one which he -- which Judge Grauman thought he did, that he had an ancillary right to have that -- to have an opportunity to present that claim without having his case become moot, before he could possibly get it up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.445" offset="1369109">And since the only way to do that was to grant him his liberty on -- on reasonable bail, by a fix bail in the amount of $35 and let him out.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.407" offset="1681011">Well, that's -- that's an interesting thing that -- and maybe it's peculiar to Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.668" offset="1710059">You see under Kentucky law, you can't sue a police officer for wrongful arrest, if the criminal case is not terminated in your favor first.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.598" offset="1769723">Now, this is quite a standard rule of private law as far as malicious prosecution is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.648" offset="1793964">It is rather -- it is not a standard rule of private law in false imprisonment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.342" offset="1816743">Most States hold that where your action is for false imprisonment for a summary arrest, you can test the legality of the rest -- of the arrest quite independently of the -- of the legality of -- of the ultimate outcome of the criminal prosecution, but Kentucky says otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.758" offset="1890408">In Kentucky, if you -- if you don't win the criminal case, you -- you're out of court on your false imprisonment as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.989" offset="1923323">Now, when a Police Court Judge is faced within Kentucky, with the problem -- with a situation where on the one hand, he doesn't really think the defendant is deserving of punishment but on the other hand, he doesn't want to make it possible for a defendant to sue a police officer for wrongful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.545" offset="2005556">It is the common thing for the Police Court to say, “We will file this case away.”</text>
            <text syncTime="482.938" offset="2035127">Which means it is in a state of indefinite suspended animation.</text>

            <text syncTime="488.971" offset="2059264">What is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="489.820" offset="2062608">No, it's on -- it's -- it's technically subject to being reopened on notice by the prosecution or by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.233" offset="2096253">And if it is so reopened, then it's tried like any other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.514" offset="2109419">In -- in practically every case, it is -- it just goes to sleep.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.051" offset="2127600">It has a residual effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.260" offset="2136377">Future employers can see that it's an unresolved case and if they don't-- if they're out of state employers and don't know how we do things in Kentucky exactly, why they make it -- draw the wrong conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.748" offset="2182353">It -- it may have an effect possibly on the judge in a later case, but as a practical matter, the case is finished except for purposes of a malicious prosecution action.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.721" offset="2226239">Now, two or three years ago, in the case of Van Arsdale against Caswell and after it was made to get the Kentucky Court of Appeals to recognize that -- that the case really was over when it was filed away.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.339" offset="2272737">And therefore, that a malicious prosecution action should be possible and the Kentucky Court of Appeals said, “No, we don't think that's so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="552.091" offset="2311711">It is still open, but you must remember that a case can be filed away without the defendant's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.501" offset="2349328">Now, they said also, “Is that if the defendant asks to have the case heard and the court files it away nevertheless, that is a final termination from which he can appeal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="574.472" offset="2401259">So in this case, on the -- on the January 20th hearing when they asked us if we wouldn't like to have the $10 fine on the loitering and the vagrancy filed away, what actually happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="589.252" offset="2460400">We first said, “No, we would not like a $10 fine on the loitering.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.177" offset="2472103">If you're willing to give us a $20 fine, we'd like it better than -- than a $10.”</text>
            <text syncTime="597.306" offset="2492583">And so, that's what we got.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.980" offset="2499271">Then he said, “We'll file away the vagrancy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="601.847" offset="2510764">And I said “No, Your Honor, I'd prefer it if you would please dismiss the vagrancy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="609.428" offset="2541066">Obviously, if -- if the court had considered the defendant to be guilty of vagrancy, he would have to right to file away the case, it would've been his duty to find him guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.916" offset="2583071">So, we said under Van Arsdale against Caswell, we have a right to have it -- to have it adjudicated and the decision should be a dismissal, we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.663" offset="2629987">Without hearing any further evidence or argument, the court said, “In that event, the question is do you want an appealable sentence or not?”</text>
            <text syncTime="640.468" offset="2665200">And we said, “We prefer to have none, but if it's going to be a sentence, we prefer an appealable sentence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="648.356" offset="2696756">And he said, “Well, you can either have a $10 fine which is the maximum fine that the statute authorizes or a 30-day jail sentence which is the minimum jail sentence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="657.736" offset="2734268">And we took the minimum jail sentence and we appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.341" offset="2744717">And in March -- March 18th, the case was heard before a jury in a Circuit Court and resulted in a directed verdict of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.127" offset="2775855">In that case, Your Honor, we were offered this opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.487" offset="2797275">In the case from which we are now seeking relief -- the judgments from which we are now seeking relief, we were not offered that opportunity.</text>
