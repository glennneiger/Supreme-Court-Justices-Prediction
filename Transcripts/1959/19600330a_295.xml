            <text syncTime="39.051" offset="259532">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.893" offset="274996">This case involves an area of intergovernmental tax immunity and submission through taxation which is not heretofore been determined by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.206" offset="328182">Briefly, the salient facts are, in 1942 and 1943, the Defense Plant Corporation, a subsidiary of RFC acquired and improved certain property in the San Diego County.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.942" offset="403101">That property was leased to a war contractor, the predecessor of this appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.619" offset="433821">It was used during the war and the manufacture of war material.On October 15th of 1945, the lessee contractor terminated the links.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.789" offset="510516">On May 29th, 1946, Reconstruction Finance Corporation declared the property surplus under the provisions of the Surplus Property Act of 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.294" offset="580524">From 1947 to 1948, the property was taken over by War Assets Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.079" offset="619708">It was actually used, as appears from testimony, herein the record at page 45.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.612" offset="649801">It was actually used by the United States as a depot for the storage and sale of surplus war material.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.897" offset="690970">The former lessee had vacated the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.214" offset="708211">In 1948, there commenced an interim occupancy by the former lessee who owned property immediately adjacent to the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.218" offset="756276">This interim occupancy resulted in the lease of September 1, 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.181" offset="788146">This lease is set forth in the record and appears -- commencing at page 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.824" offset="842689">The lease required the lessee to pay taxes that were roughly assessed against the premises or against the lessor or lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.373" offset="892844">Now, let us go back for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.711" offset="906219">Here is government property admittedly owned by a governmental agency, the Defense Plant Corporation, a subsidiary of RFC.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.403" offset="941014">This being so, how come any taxes?</text>
            <text syncTime="214.090" offset="959718">In 1932 with the enactment of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act, the Congress concerted a provision which it drew from the old National Bank Act, first enacted in 18th -- in the 19th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.742" offset="1030353">Under which, real property of the Corporation or was subjected to tax to the same extent as any other property was taxed and expressed waiver applicable to real property of the Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.319" offset="1120632">Therein lay the basis for the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.999" offset="1143411">In the interim however by the enactment of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, mechanics were created by which an owning agency defined in the acts in terms to encompass RFC would declare that the -- the property was surplus to its needs and would execute a declaration of surplus property which would be transmitted to the War Assets Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.079" offset="1267649">The War Assets Administration would then have the responsibility for the control, management, maintenance with all of the various attributes which the Surplus Property Act gave to the United States as a result of the declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.069" offset="1351659">The provisions of the Surplus Property Act insofar as here applicable are contained in Appendix A to appellant's opening brief at pages 1 to 8 and regulations which were issued thereunder are further contained in the that appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.761" offset="1438386">The case thus involves the question of whether or not the failure of RFC to execute a deed to the property at the time that it issued its declaration of the surplus to its needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.619" offset="1525844">The failure of RFC to execute that deed --</text>

            <text syncTime="808.820" offset="3338637">This case came up here by appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.534" offset="3353475">Jurisdiction under the problems in the way this case arose is a difficult one.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.650" offset="3382000">It's appellant's position that there has here been drawn the question of validity of a statute of a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.694" offset="3410108">Those statutes being, the statutes under which taxes are levied on all property by local governments within California.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.719" offset="3450232">It cannot be questioned here that a federal question has been raised from the very inception of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.752" offset="3482415">It is appellant's contention that the statute has applied on the tax resulting, was attacked on federal grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.224" offset="3528286">The fact that we are seeking recoupment rather resist -- resisting the imposition of the tax, it makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.696" offset="3558170">We point to the Court the case of Beaver County and Allegheny County, all of which are cited in the briefs, that there is here as in both Beaver County and in the County of Allegheny been drawn in to the question the validity of a tax, the argument that could be made on whether in attacking to that tax, we are attacking the statute under which it was levied for merely the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.677" offset="3670079">It seems to be detailing with the distinctions which have no realism.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.676" offset="3694111">In the last analysis, the statute has in existence and purpose only insofar as the results of the levy.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.937" offset="3723160">We are attacking that levy and in so doing must perforce to be attacking the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.795" offset="3750536">Be that as it may, it is appellant's position here that the issues of this case clearly demonstrated that it is one which presents a very substantial federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.465" offset="3809259">One that has wider application than might have first appeared and one which has been decided by the Court below in a manner probably not in the Court with other decisions of this Court, as we shall point out in an argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.866" offset="3878849">And that appeal lies or if not this Court as admonished by the statute, we should take the papers as a petition for certiorari and grant certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.396" offset="3924929">I think this, when we come down to the issue of jurisdiction, either this Court wants to hear it on the merits before it does.</text>

            <text syncTime="967.947" offset="3975189">(Inaudible) to you that it's a case which should be heard on the merits to resolve a conflict which exist between the Court of Claims, the Supreme Court of Michigan and there are other cases as will be discussed by the Government which -- with which the Government is presently concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.050" offset="4075604">We see then that under the Surplus Property Act, it is -- it has been provided a complete mechanics by which property owned by the government corporation is administered, used, cared for, controlled, sold, leased and in deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.173" offset="4164106">The proceeds from leasing whole sale do not go back to our suit, if having declared the property surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.708" offset="4194200">They are covered into the general treasury of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.178" offset="4212067">If something happened to the property during it's controlled by War Assets, that risk of lost lives not for -- on RFC but on the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.564" offset="4261595">It is our position that the Congress in enacting the Surplus Property Act was utilizing the powers expressly conferred upon it by the Constitution that the Congress shall have the power to dispose of and make all read for rules and regulations respect to the territory or other property belonging to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.156" offset="4348008">In furtherance to that power, the Congress enacted the Surplus Property Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.790" offset="4370578">After that enactment, Reconstruction Finance Corporation by its own voluntary act executed a document which under the framework of the Surplus Property Act transferred out of RFC all incidence and all intendments of ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.707" offset="4462216">Indeed, there was no deed in a formal sense of the word on any of the property of the Defense Plant Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.483" offset="4517282">This property, bear in mind, was acquired by the Defense Plant Corporation by a Joint Resolution of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.206" offset="4552182">There was transfer from the Defense Plant Corporation to RFC all property of the Defense Plant Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.505" offset="4585409">No deed was ever executed by Defense Plant Corporation to RFC covering any items of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.448" offset="4617174">All of this was accomplished by the Joint Resolution of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.282" offset="4636505">Here, the Administrator of War Assets, after this declaration, could, by his owner act, give and execute a conveyance without participation in any degree of Reconstruction Finance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.660" offset="4721977">I should like, if I might, to reserve a balance of my time for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.121" offset="4739845">But before closing, I would like to call attention to a statement made by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Detroit-Murray cases on the question of intergovernmental submission to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.271" offset="4800449">Since intergovernmental submission to taxation is primarily a problem of finance and legislation, it is immaterial that contracts by Government have been purposefully drawn so as to vest title to the property that is subject to the tax in the Government and thereby withdrawn from the taxing power of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.600" offset="4885817">We feel that this is so here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.548" offset="4897520">Now, what we are dealing with is the true ownership of the property, not the fact that for chance, no deed was executed or none was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.151" offset="4951960">There was a complete and effectual transfer out of RFC to War Assets and there was no waiver with respect to property of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1231.770" offset="5030431">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.367" offset="5044851">If I may, on behalf of the United States, phrase the issue just likely differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.263" offset="5068466">The real issue here is whether the absence of a deed from the RFC to the United States was the event which made this property taxable by the State of California or the County of San Diego.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.482" offset="5129279">The appellees admit that this is the only issue for they state in their brief that if a deed had been executed, they would not contest the immunity of this property from local taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.187" offset="5180165">So as I say, in phrasing the question, we focus immediately upon the sole and single issue was a deed required in order to render this property no longer property of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.554" offset="5249546">And I submit that I can show to the Court very briefly that the statutes involved as well decisions which we rely on make it plain that no deed was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.628" offset="5305866">As counsel has already pointed out, Section 8 of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act of 1932 provided for the exception of property of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation from state and local taxation but it saves from that exemption real property and made it expressly subject to such taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.959" offset="5395205">It is perfectly obvious that the reason for that subjection of real property of RFC, the local taxation was that in 1930s, the RFC was engaged in essentially commercial activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.497" offset="5453406">We submit here that once this property was no longer being used for any form of commercial or industrial activity of RFC but had been declared surplus and was transferred to another agency of the Government to fulfill regular governmental purposes, that the reason for this so-called waiver of immunity collapsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.470" offset="5545253">This is made patently obvious when we look at the provisions of the Surplus Property Act of 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.137" offset="5579943">That Act provides that the owning agency, in this case the RFC, may declare property surplus when it determines that it is surplus to its needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.322" offset="5632711">That is not some oral statement, it is a formal declaration, a copy of it is printed in the record before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.473" offset="5665311">Upon that declaration of surplus, the War Assets Administration took over the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.062" offset="5699584">It took it over in this case in the sense of utilizing it for a storage depot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.538" offset="5725497">By statute, it was given the duty of caring for and handling the property to control it's disposal to dispose of it by sale, lease, exchange or transfer and under Section 15 (b) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, the War Assets Administration was expressly empowered by Congress to execute any documents of title which were necessary to effectuate the purposes of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.920" offset="5847019">Now, I submit to Your Honors that if a deed was necessary to transfer title to this property from the RFC to the United States or to the War Assets Administration, it could not have been empowered to execute a deed to a purchaser whereas Congress has expressly said that by statute, that -- the War Assets Administration may execute such a deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.843" offset="5950777">The same result follows if we look at the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 which repeal the Surplus Property Act of 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.583" offset="5993723">In that Act, we are now dealing with the General Services Administrator who succeeded to the War Assets Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.761" offset="6022457">He is given supervision, direction over disposition of surplus property, the care and handling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.736" offset="6050356">And any agency authorized by the General Service -- General Services Administrator to dispose of surplus property may do so by sale, exchange, lease or transfer and may execute a deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.472" offset="6105213">Here again, we have an expressed statutory provision for a deed to be executed where if we follow appellees reasoning in that of the Court below, there has been a gap in the chain of title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.086" offset="6155682">Obviously, no gap exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.138" offset="6167907">Finally, we come to the statute referred to as Public Law 388 which was a 1955 amendment to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.423" offset="6213047">That was adverted to by Mr. Justice Whittaker a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.791" offset="6230497">That Act, however, was not a recognition or an avoidance of the decision of the Court of Claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="2584.584" offset="10441749">In Continental Motors versus Township of Muskegon, which is a decision in the Court with the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.891" offset="10474977">We have exactly the same reasoning as adopted by the Supreme Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.440" offset="10497128">They relied on the statement of -- of General Services Administrator Larson that the property was not to be removed from the tax rolls and they said that's the result we should reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.068" offset="10543626">But it is not the result which should be reached in accordance with law as Mr. Larson himself recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.318" offset="10568600">In fact, the ridiculous absurdity to which this decision has led is illustrated by a case now pending in the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit referred to in our brief under the name of United States versus County of Lawrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.926" offset="10631084">That case also involved the disposal of surplus property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.803" offset="10646549">And in that case the Court, the District Court in the Western District of Pennsylvania has held that even though a deed has been delivered, the property remains taxable to the RFC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.505" offset="10693360">So we are taking this one step at a time until we find that once Congress has enacted a waiver of immunity with respect to RFC property, it seems to attach to the property forever and can never be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.697" offset="10746128">That certainly is not a result which is in accordance with logic and reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.273" offset="10772459">I think the error of all these decisions in Continental and in County of Lawrence and at the court below is that it fails to recognize that this property has been effectively removed from the control, custody, operation, responsibility of RFC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.086" offset="10855737">It is now fully under the control of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.224" offset="10872247">And that even if it be held that bare and legal title has some significance in this context, taxation should not be held dependant upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.201" offset="10920208">The decision below failed to recognize that the waiver of immunity from local taxation enacted by Congress in 1932 with respect to property of RFC, has lost all reason for existence as applied to this property which has become intermingled with general property of the United States to be disposed of as part of the Surplus Property Disposal Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.291" offset="11028564">Upon such transfer to a disposal agency and upon such intermingling of the property with other property of the United States, it should be treated in the same fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.541" offset="11073494">The waiver of immunity enacted by Congress falls and the governmental immunity regularly attaching to real property of the United States becomes applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.185" offset="11116126">For these reasons, we urge that the judgment should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2764.847" offset="11162728">Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.546" offset="11177566">I will confine my remarks, with the Court's permission, merely to the question of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.650" offset="11209958">The appellant has come before this Court on the basis of subsection (2) of the code in which he states that there has -- that there is present here and that he has drawn in to question the validity of a statute of the State on the ground that it is repugnant to the Constitution, treaties and laws of the United States and that the decision a -- there's a decision in favor of the validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.681" offset="11334092">This is the burden of the appellant to -- to prove this that he has met these conditions where the Court has previously said that these conditions must be complied with closely because this is a limit on the Court's jurisdiction under an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.998" offset="11399398">He has made a broad reference in the courts below to our taxing statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.685" offset="11418102">He has cited no specific statute or statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.115" offset="11435865">The Court has said that in prior occasion that it is not enough to say that the tax infringes on a federal right or immunity but that he -- he must be specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.639" offset="11481945">He must make a substantial effort to point out where there is a state law involved or state laws so that in fact, the highest court of the State may have had the opportunity to have reviewed the constitutionality of the state law against federal laws and statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.591" offset="11557700">And this, he has failed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.620" offset="11565850">I would observe to Your Honors that the -- Mr. Leroy Wright has observed that this -- and as he said it in effect that the law, he spoke of attacking the tax and that this, in effect, wasn't attacked on the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.742" offset="11634291">But the Court in the Wilson case, Wilson versus Cook, which is in the briefs, 327 U.S., has stated in so many words that it is not enough to attack the tax but he must attack the statutes and this, he has failed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.379" offset="11696880">And so this I don't believe as he has stated as a detailing without realism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.252" offset="11724361">The -- the state court has never nor have the state courts ever passed upon the -- any particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.174" offset="11756022">Our -- our laws regarding taxes are on harmony with the federal laws and Constitution, nor do I believe that this Court is being asked to overturn any particular state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.772" offset="11798444">The only issue here, as I see it, and the only issue raised by the appellant in the courts below and ruled on and passed upon by the California courts has merely been the interpretation of the federal laws we are faced with, the Reconstruction Finance Act, the Surplus Property Act of 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.091" offset="11875767">The California court if it had decided that there was -- that this property was not taxable under federal law and that's all it directed its attention to is federal law and the interpretation of it and what was constitution -- the congressional intent, then the California laws would have followed naturally and there would not have been a tax or the tax would not have been sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.648" offset="11961971">On the other hand, the -- the courts below decided that the federal congressional intent was to -- to allow this property to be taxed and thus, the California laws followed in natural sequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.395" offset="12028949">I would say further that the Beaver case and the Allegheny case cited by council are not in support of his position in the least.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.756" offset="12062386">In both cases, we have writ of error and writ of appeal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.617" offset="12081821">In each instance, we had an instance where there was a specific state statute involving the interpretation and meaning of what constituted real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.610" offset="12117765">In the Allegheny case, it was having machinery and the case of the Beaver case, it involved the definition of fixtures as being real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.056" offset="12147545">And the courts -- the lower courts had to pass upon this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.632" offset="12161860">This was a main argument and subsequently, of course, the United States allowed writs of appeal in these cases because down below, there had been great emphasis placed upon the interpretation of state laws as applied and the validity of those state laws was drawn in to the question and the question of whether it is repugnant or not to the Federal Constitution was dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.109" offset="12243780">We have no situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.016" offset="12251408">Counsel has not carried the burden which his was -- his responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.074" offset="12271679">And in our opinion, this writ does not lie.</text>

            <text syncTime="3377.583" offset="13613746">Mr. Chief Justice Warren, Mr. Justices of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.429" offset="13637047">First, might I state that I regret very much that the Chief Trial Deputy in County Counsel of San Diego County did not or is not able to be here to argue his own case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.591" offset="13685739">He tried this matter from the trial courts through the Supreme Court of the State of California and unforeseeably, he had a heart attack and has had to retire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.333" offset="13724714">So, in effect, I am pinch-hitting for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.082" offset="13735685">I hope I will be able to do him justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.087" offset="13751672">We have some rather interesting questions here with respect to passage of title and with respect to whether a deed is needed and whether this is a question that should be determined of this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.405" offset="13825024">The Supreme Court of California expressed itself as this is being the sole question, whether the land seized to be real property of the RFC when control and responsibility was subsequently transferred to the War Assets Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.864" offset="13898794">Michigan, on the other hand, expresses the question as being in the final analysis the question at issue was whether Congress clearly manifested an intent in the enactment of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 or otherwise that property of the RFC declared surplus without a transfer of the legal title should thereupon become immune from taxation, not withstanding, the waiver in the Act creating said corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.852" offset="14018748">The first point that I wish to make is that we are attempting to determine this question on a matter of what was the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.314" offset="14060648">In 1932, when the original Act was passed, a provision stated any real property of the Corporation, any real property of the Corporation indicating a predecessor to RFC shall be subject to state, territorial, county, municipal or local taxation to the same extent and according to its value as other real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.038" offset="14179558">Here, we have an expressed waiver of immunity but not only that, we have an expressed consent for the State to tax as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.817" offset="14226683">It's not merely aware of immunity but a statement that the State shall tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.989" offset="14251342">These taxes have to do with the years 1951 to 1952, fiscal years through 1954, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.573" offset="14285615">The taxes in this case are not particularly in dispute, and I think that we are faced with three separate cases which involved the identical issue or the identical principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.966" offset="14347264">So far as I have been able to recall, and I'm sorry that I can't prove to you by a way of the record which is before you, it is my understanding that RFC is, at the present time, the record owner of this property on the tax rolls of the County of San Diego.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.457" offset="14437230">Now, let's go in to the intent of Congress in passing this so-called waiver or giving this expressed consent to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.751" offset="14474428">It was done for one purpose only, and I think that it generally recognized and that was during the depression years that there were properties being transferred and difficulties going on with respect to taxes to the extent that local taxation was in really a pretty sad situation if it was going to be necessary for the Government to take over various properties, and also to take care of that situation of the need for the local communities to be able to run themselves by the use of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.304" offset="14612564">In 1944, when the so-called Surplus Property Act was passed, the -- I'm trying to find the exact statement as to what was said in the preamble of the 1944 (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.259" offset="14792391">Congress, after the determination by the Court of Claims and after the determination by the Comptroller General in his opinion, came to the conclusion in Section 701 and stated that a declaration of policy was this, "The Congress recognizes that the transfer of real property having a taxable status from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation or any of its subsidiaries to another government department is often operated to remove such property from the tax rolls of states and local taxing authorities, thereby creating an undue and an unexpected burden upon such states and local taxing authorities and causing disruption of their operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.330" offset="14956648">It is the purpose of this title to furnish temporary measures of relive for such states and local taxing authorities by providing that payments in lieu of taxes shall be made with respect to the real property so transferred on or after January 1st, 1946."</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.063" offset="15015581">Apparent to that time and for a period of eight years and so far as the Reconstruction Finance Corporation was concerned and the General Services Administration was concerned, it was the interpretation of the administrative agency that was given the duty of handling this property that it was necessary to pass a deed or pass a title for the purpose of determining whether there should be an immunity from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.630" offset="15141909">The basic reason that they did not desire to tax or did not desire to transfer title on these cases was because they said some 1500 plants would be taken off of the local tax rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.398" offset="15193004">Likewise, they thought that they were interpreting what was the true intent of Congress and after all, this Honorable Court is to determine one thing, what was the intent of Congress with respect to taxability insofar as local communities were concerned where property has been declared surplus and where it has been accepted by War Assets Administration?</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.475" offset="15297285">Even the case upon which counsel so heavily relies, the Sedgwick County case is very cautious, that being a Court of Claims case, to say that insofar as a mere declaration of surplus, this does not relieve immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.236" offset="15368338">It is necessary that there be an acceptance on the part of one of the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.759" offset="15386415">But what was the intent of Congress in passing the Surplus Property Act of 1944?</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.130" offset="15407940">Was it for the purpose of disposing a property and relieving itself of immunity from taxation, which is granted by the original Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.316" offset="15452662">Or was it for the purpose of orderly transfer of properties of the United States either to some other governmental activity, at which time we would claim, of course, there would be no tax by way of passage of legal title or it was to be placed in the hands of some private individual whereby would again be placed back on the tax rolls?</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.776" offset="15554435">It is my contention that the purpose of it was that, in effect, all these disposal agencies were doing was to dispose of property for the purpose of an orderly disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.331" offset="15600724">And if they were not in fact the owners of the real property as it's indicated in the original statement of the exemption from tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.487" offset="15641370">Well, let's see if we can cover this point with respect to the passage of a deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.789" offset="15658506">There's only one way that I know of that property is taxed -- real property is taxed in the original instance in a State, and that is when the property is placed upon the tax rolls as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.947" offset="15719111">This is the only notification that they have and under -- under Revenue and Taxation Code 611 of our State, the assessor is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.697" offset="15758190">It is a mandatory duty upon him to assess property to the record owner, the legal record owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.041" offset="15791522">Could it not be that insofar as we are concern that this particular property as such that the passage of title or the indication of passage of title on those records of the local authorities who had been given the power of tax was for the purpose of assuring the local taxing authorities what they could attack or what they could tax?</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.210" offset="15892250">It might well be that we should consider another thing, and that is the fact that even in the Beaver County case, it has been determined that it is necessary for the courts to consider, the fact that there will be a great disruption of the -- of the taxing authorities in particular cases if it is not considered that where expressed taxation authority is given, then the State should have the right to have notice of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.733" offset="16022340">I believe that I have covered pretty thoroughly in our brief the various questions that have been propounded to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.057" offset="16055568">We are going very definitely upon the question of the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.839" offset="16078764">I believe that the Supreme Court of the State of California, in its expression of what was the intent of Congress, the intent of Congress being not to disrupt taxation but to have a fair share passed on to the local communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.238" offset="16140309">And likewise, of -- this one factor, which I think should be particularly known.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.650" offset="16157968">Number one, Rohr Aircraft's predecessor sold this property to the Federal Government in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.936" offset="16187120">Number two, it again went back in to possess -- possession in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.757" offset="16210422">Number three, during this period of time, it was required by the Federal Government to pay the tax by its very lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.244" offset="16248351">This is not a case where the Federal Government property is being taxed, Rohr Aircraft is being taxed and the Federal Government has recognized it by a way of a lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.892" offset="16282937">It has stated in the lease, and I hope I can find it, in the Tax Provision Number 13, "Lessee agrees to pay to the proper authority when and as the same becomes due and payable, all taxes, assessments and similar charges which at anytime during the term of this lease maybe taxed, assessed or imposed upon a lessor or a lessee with respect to or upon the leased premises and personal property," and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.084" offset="16423685">And it even goes to the extent of stating that in the event a lessee fails to pay when due any taxes, assessments, utility bills or similar charges is about set forth then lessor may, at its option, face such taxes, assessments, bills or other charges that require lessee to immediately reimburse it for such cost which the amount is hereby declared to be additional rental and to become immediately due and payable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.261" offset="16524413">Lessor reserves the right to contest the validity or amount of any tax assessment which, of course, we do not dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.728" offset="16610304">In view of this fact that I have just stated that this tax is to go back to Rohr Aircraft and not to the Federal Government, they now seek to come in and obtain this tax back for the purpose of their own profits for the purpose of the funds going in to their coverage, rightful taxes on property, and if Rohr owned this property, it would be so taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.451" offset="16765158">I think, perhaps, there is no need for me to go further in this case with exception of making one further statement, that is, that the lease in this case was entered into by Reconstruction Finance Corporation in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.894" offset="16838928">And in 1954, Reconstruction Finance Corporation by and through General Services Administrator made an additional years leased on this same property, if this is an indicia of RFC having no interest, no ability or no control over this property, then I am sadly mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.334" offset="16924714">And I thank you extremely for your wonderful courtesy.</text>

            <text syncTime="4245.076" offset="17083643">I was puzzled by two cases which are cited and referred to on page 3 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.771" offset="17114467">They are old ones but they eliminate -- eliminate the problem for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4257.111" offset="17131813">One is the Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Company and the other Jaybird Mining Company against Weir.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.530" offset="17169533">At least these two cases are remarkable because they arose within a remarkably short time with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.529" offset="17197537">In the Illuminating Oil Company, oils were withdrawn from Indian lands in Oklahoma and had been mingled with other quarreled concededly taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.131" offset="17239855">And this case arose under the early concept of intergovernmental tax immunity when anything that was taken from the Government by a private contractor, was covered with the governmental immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.730" offset="17302340">In the Jaybird case, we had ore which was mined on Indian lands and in the bin on the tax tally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.284" offset="17344554">In both cases, the same statutes of Oklahoma were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.221" offset="17372244">In both cases, the same assessment procedures and levying those taxes were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4325.005" offset="17403382">In both cases, the same frame of immunity was raised and yet, in the Jaybird case, the writ of error or an appeal was allowed while in the Indian Territory case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.831" offset="17462732">The appeal was dismissed, although the Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.591" offset="17481749">Here, as in Wilson versus Cook, how do we distinguish an attack on statute which counsel says we must from an attack upon a tax which is the product of the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.333" offset="17564714">I think that an explanation of Wilson against Cook is the statement of Court which is contained on page 4 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.790" offset="17606510">As the record does not show, the plaintiffs presented for decision to the State Supreme Court any federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4385.394" offset="17644962">They have no appeal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4388.911" offset="17659068">I would refer the Court to the opinion of a District Court of Appeal, which appears both in the jurisdictional statement and in our opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.013" offset="17711417">In the jurisdictional statement, that opinion appears and attempted to be, and I am referring expressly to page 28, the District Court of Appeals in the Fourth Appellate District.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.451" offset="17765125">Appellant contends that the taxes in question were illegal and void under the general -- the rule that lands on by the United States of America or its corporate instrumentalities are immune from state or local taxes cited McCulloch against Maryland and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.386" offset="17844955">This question was also raised in the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.472" offset="17861256">It was expressly recognized in the findings of fact made by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.347" offset="17880795">All of which are in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.807" offset="17894588">But so much for this, I think the claim that the question of jurisdiction is under some of the language which this Court has used in dealing with other cases, a close one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4460.158" offset="17944012">I think it equally claim that this does present a substantial federal question which has not heretofore been resolved by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4468.651" offset="17977971">And certainly, one on which a guidance it needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.568" offset="18001690">Counsel has laid to execrable stress upon administrative policy, a policy adopted by the Administrator of War Asset, Mr. Larson.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.089" offset="18047770">It's interesting to note however that this policy is one which Mr. Larson abandoned and counsel is here urging that an abandoned policy be adopted as a rule of this Court on a theory that administrative policy, an interpretation that's been long in effect serves as a guide for statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.528" offset="18145468">True, this is the -- the rule but it involves a -- an administrative policy which has long been in effect and which has been followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4523.532" offset="18197504">This can then become a guide.</text>
            <text syncTime="4526.068" offset="18207640">But certainly, no such administrative policy has here been shown by a mere statement in a letter from Mr. Larson that he used to do it this way but he stopped doing in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.471" offset="18277230">Counsel has a statement that it is Rohr Aircraft that has been taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.328" offset="18312652">This statement is not so find.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.421" offset="18329057">The entire record demonstrates that the tax filled the assessments, the levies were made upon property of the United States and upon that property, not upon Rohr Aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.158" offset="18391960">Tax bills were issued in the name of Reconstruction Finance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.209" offset="18412231">They were sent and it is demonstrated by testimony in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.127" offset="18431875">Presumably, to General Services Administration, at least the lessee got from GSA during the tax years here involved, they were forwarded to the lessee from GSA along with the request that they be paid in accordance with the provisions of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.406" offset="18517034">This, they worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="4605.182" offset="18524139">But these taxes are ad valorem taxes levied upon property of the United States drew.</text>
            <text syncTime="4613.136" offset="18555904">It may be a property of one its governmental instrumentalities but it's nonetheless property of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.609" offset="18581817">And it subjects the property of the United States to seizure, to levy in the event the Rohr Aircraft Corporation did not comply with the provisions of its lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.252" offset="18636361">What would happen?</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.868" offset="18642840">These properties of the United States would have been sold under the mechanics provided by the Revenue and Taxation Code where the seizure in sale of delinquent taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4647.903" offset="18694980">They could have been.</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="4649.077" offset="18699682">Do you -- do you, by that argument, sustain this right that all property, whether owned by the RFC or if not by its name is property of the United States not subject therefore to taxation?</text>

            <label>Mr. Leroy A. Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="4667.202" offset="18772198">I -- I'm not talking about the waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.818" offset="18782647">The property -- any property owned by the United States or by the United States to any of its corporate instrumentalities with respect to which there has been no waiver and if the waiver is not applicable, I think it's a matter of general law which had been recognized takes with it the constitutional immunity of the Federal Government from a tax which is levied upon the property as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.384" offset="18904900">To distinguish the taxes, which were involved in the Detroit and Murray case which were levied upon the rights and interests of the lessee, the privilege tax, this tax is not such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.343" offset="18964773">This tax is levied upon the property of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.569" offset="18985671">If it's permitted, it's permitted at all solely because the Congress has waived its immunity and that waiver is still applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.849" offset="19034781">We contend that after the declaration of surplus, waiver is no longer applicable that it seizes then to be property of the RFC.</text>
            <text syncTime="4745.362" offset="19084831">Just the same as though, for example, a similar language is contained in the statute creating the Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4758.089" offset="19135718">Suppose the Congress transferred the activities and functions of the Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation to the Department of Agriculture by legislative enactment, what would happen to the waiver?</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.858" offset="19190784">We contend that it would fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.572" offset="19209697">Comment has been here made, again, that Rohr is being taxed, the appellant is here being taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.470" offset="19245223">This ignores the fact as pointed out in our reply brief that California has a very specific and express system for the taxation of possessory interest in tax and in properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.829" offset="19310738">We make no complaint about that tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.838" offset="19322755">That is a tax which has been set up by the stipulations entered into in the court below as an equitable concept of any recovery which we might obtain here if our contention is sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="4818.811" offset="19378657">But that is a tax which would put us in a power with other lessees of other exempt properties within the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.716" offset="19422229">This tax is levied upon the Government's property as a tax upon that property and not upon this lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.729" offset="19470294">This Court has stated in recent cases that a State may not constitutionally taxed property owned by the Federal Government even though the property is in private hands and the taxes to be collected upon the private taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.944" offset="19583143">That statement and that language is called from this Court's various opinions in the Michigan cases recently decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.093" offset="19623790">And we believe that here, the State has been attempted to constitutionally tax property (Inaudible) by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.962" offset="19667257">We, therefore, submit that the case should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.052" offset="19687528">Thank you.</text>
