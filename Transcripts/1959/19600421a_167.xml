            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- Texas Gas Transmission Corporation et al., Petitioners, versus Shell Oil Company, and Number 170, Federal Power Commission, Petitioner, versus Shell Oil Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.570" offset="161625">Mr. -- Mr. Correa.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mathias_f_correa" startTime="17.063" stopTime="287.425">
            <label>Mr. Mathias F. Correa</label>
            <text syncTime="17.063" offset="171656">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.668" offset="182000">I represent both petitioners in 167, Texas Gas Transmission Co., which is the pipeline involved in this matter, and the Louisville Gas and Electric Company, which is also a petitioner and which is vitally interested in -- in this matter as a customer of Texas Gas and as the supplier of 158,000 consumers of gas in the Louisville area.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.628" offset="269876">Now, as Mr. Gatchell very promptly pointed out yesterday, the economics of the natural gas industry demand long-term commitments between pipeline companies on the one hand, producers of gas on the other for the supply of gas primarily so that the pipeline companies may finance the construction, otherwise, in this case the purchase from the Government of the pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.753" offset="362350">Now, because these contracts are long-term, and by long-term, I mean 20 to 25 years, the Atlantic contract here involved, for example, is 25-year term, because they are long-term, they usually contain, almost invariably, one might say, some form of predetermined redetermination of price, redetermination in order to take care of economic change over the long-term which regrettably has been mostly in a upward direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.170" offset="484080">Predetermined redetermine of price so the parties are bound to it either to an absolute price increase or to a standard from the times when they enter into the contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.110" offset="547819">Now, if the Court please, this -- the long-term character of these contracts accounts as well for the presence in them of what is called loosely in the trade as most “favored-nation” clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.796" offset="606542">This term could be misleading because it does not, in the natural gas industry, mean necessarily as it might in, for example, of the patent licensing field or some other field that the pipeline company will pay the producer in whose contract that term appears, the highest price that it is paying or does pay to any other producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.511" offset="705390">Rather, the term is more properly or the clause is more properly called as the Commission called it here a price escalation provision which provides for the increase in price upon the occurrence of a specified event.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.402" offset="760978">And the specified event is the subject of bargaining in contract between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.739" offset="782294">Now, there are two such clauses which have been referred to in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.231" offset="804342">The first is the clause that appears in the Atlantic contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.618" offset="825866">And that -- there, the event which triggers, as they put it, the escalation into the Shell contract rather it's the -- it's the clause that appears in the Shell contract, I misspoke myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.863" offset="882813">And there, the event which triggers the escalation in price is entry into a new contract for the purchase of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.138" offset="911966">Now, I am aware that Mr. Justice Whittaker quite correctly pointed out yesterday that the word “new” does not appear in the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.160" offset="948015">And that is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.936" offset="951150">But if we turn to the record where the full clause in question appears at pages 66 to 67 is clause 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.751" offset="990333">At the bottom of 66, we will see immediately what -- why we call it “new” contract for the purchase of gas at a higher price because our clause begins, bottom of 66, if, at anytime after December 31, 1951, buyer shall enter, that's the pipeline, into a contract providing for the purchase of it by gas produced in a certain place etcetera at a higher price, then the price under this contract is increased accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.608" offset="1117811">And you will note the further provision, in the last sentence of this clause which says that in determining whether the price payable under such other, I would say, new contract but post 1951 contract in my -- would satisfy the argument just as well, this such other post 1951 contract, due consideration shall be given to the provisions of the contract -- of this contract as compared with the other as to quality, delivery pressures, gathering and compressing arrangements, quantity and other pertinent factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="287.425" offset="1253021">Mr. Correa, is this a usual form of escalator contract, escalator clause?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mathias F. Correa</label>
            <text syncTime="297.437" offset="1293145">There are several forms actually.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.800" offset="1302549">And as the record here reflects and also as is reflected in the -- in the petitions for rehearing -- for certiorari and particularly our reply petition, there are quite a few different forms in use in -- in the trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.204" offset="1372139">And I may say, if Your Honor please, that where the party is meant, the escalation to be triggered by a payment simply of a higher price under an existing contract, they said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.413" offset="1428982">And this is the point which the Commission made in denying rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.637" offset="1449880">In the proceeding before the Commission, the Commission said why Shell when they mean that, say it and cited and quoted two or three Shell escalation clauses of that kind.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="347.116" stopTime="352.014">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="347.116" offset="1491884">This is a more unlimited escalator clause than the usual one.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.475" offset="1509230">I've seen it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mathias F. Correa</label>
            <text syncTime="352.014" offset="1511424">I -- I'm not prepared to say that that is so, if Your Honor please, nor -- nor do I believe the record discloses that one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.163" offset="1544025">Now, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.594" offset="1557713">Now, let me against that brief background turn to this question of expertise upon which Mr. Justice Harlan commented yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.855" offset="1594807">Now, we submit, let me put it that way, that the error of the court below were consistent not simply in failing to give weight to the Commission's expertise because the court below went further and made its own finding as to the usual objective, and I'm using their words, “in the trade”, their words again, “of these clauses”.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.805" offset="1706611">Most “favored-nation” clauses had gone on rating all types of most “favored-nation” clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.264" offset="1728449">In these, the Court found that this usual objective in the trade was to assure the seller a top price for its gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.387" offset="1768887">Now, on the basis of this finding, the Court went on to conclude that the redetermination of price by the parties to the Atlantic contract under that contract would constitute entry into a contract for the purchase of gas, and now I quote significant words because the Court qualified their finding this way, “At least, at least for the purposes of the favored-nation clause”.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.394" offset="1872959">And the Court emphasizes by finding that this would be so whether the price redetermination was determined by agreement of the parties as to controlling facts upon which price depended, which is what happened here under the Atlantic contract, all by arbitration to which the parties had bound themselves when they originally entered the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.083" offset="1967731">Now, the Court, we submit, does not only ignored the Commission's expertise but indeed assumed to itself expertise in a field in which the Commission's statutory duties, responsibilities and functions served by all rights make them better qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.814" offset="2038680">Now, this highlights, if the Court please, the answer to Mr. Justice Harlan's query, which, in substance, I may not have the words exactly right, I -- I remember as being, if the contract is clear on its face is to be construed according to its plain language, why is there a necessity for resort to expertise?</text>
            <text syncTime="503.541" offset="2117569">And the answer precisely is that the Commission at least had the expertise which enabled it to know that there wasn't any usual objective of escalation clauses “in the trade” which required that construction in this manner, at least for purposes of most “favored-nation” clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.061" offset="2215581">Now, if the Court please, we feel that the learned court below also erred in basing its decision upon a finding of fact made by the Court independently of the Commission as to the intention of the parties to the Shell contract in the negotiation of that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.861" offset="2290813">Now, as I replied brief points out at pages 5 to 6, the Court's finding was in fact based on testimony which was in any event, incompetent under the parole evidence rules because it was the testimony of the unilateral understanding of one party as to what the clause meant not communicated to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.316" offset="2360613">But more important than that point is it that if the court below felt that the Shell contract needed parole evidence for its construction, the Court should, under the unbroken line of authorities, have set the case back to the Commission with the direction to take evidence and make findings on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.592" offset="2437726">Now, we don't suggest that the contract needs parole evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="586.951" offset="2451205">Do you -- do you understand that the Court of Appeals thought it did or that they gave heed to parole evidence or that they merely construed the terms of the contract?</text>

            <text syncTime="599.837" offset="2502719">Well, if Your Honor please, I understand -- and -- and if Your Honor would turn to page 163 of the record, you can see right there exactly what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.794" offset="2550575">And I reply to the part of the last paragraph ending on the page following the Folio 178 notation, and -- and just before that, “Because of the difficulty in establishing price for so long a period, the clause in question was agreed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.583" offset="2641690">It appears that at the time of contracting Shell, Louisiana was purchasing from Atlantic but not familiar with the specific term.”</text>
            <text syncTime="640.907" offset="2666977">These facts stand strongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.492" offset="2673351">Now, those facts are based on testimony on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.686" offset="2682128">And as I say, it's incompetent testimony at best.</text>

            <text syncTime="945.396" offset="3884910">Well, the -- the answer is 580 because that's based on the records of the Commission which I take it out at least in theory before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.177" offset="3916048">Now, if the Court please, may I turn to this question of price under the Atlantic contract and what the parties did in February 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.479" offset="3965262">The court below in regarding that failed to differentiate, we submit, into the difference or differentiate between entry into a new contract that is opposed 1951 contract and a redetermination of price under a preexisting i.e.pre 1951 contract pursuant to a predetermined standard contained in such preexisting contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.246" offset="4076335">Now, I shall here concedes implicitly to be sure but unmistakably that the letter would not trigger the escalation clause of the Shell contract but it argues strenuously that that the price provisions of the Atlantic contract were not a true price redetermination clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.775" offset="4150523">In fact, Shell goes so far to say -- as -- to say that the Commission did not so hold despite the clear holding of the Commission and Shell's own specific exception to that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.710" offset="4194200">Nevertheless, the contract, in fact, did contain a specific standard which was prevailing prices in Southwestern Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.012" offset="4243414">Now, most importantly than the contract provision, the parties themselves, and this is shown by undisputed testimony in the record, the parties themselves regarded the contract as containing a standard which was binding on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.370" offset="4300884">This came out in the testimony of the Atlantic man who negotiated the agreement of -- of February 1954 and who said that in reaching that letter agreement, the parties both understood that all they were doing was trying to agree on a fact, which was controlling as the price, the fact being prevailing prices in Southwestern Louisiana, and he said, “Once we agreed on prevailing price, that was it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.457" offset="4405164">That's what the contract said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.615" offset="4409866">Now, further than that, the contemporaneous written record shows that during the period between August 1953 and February 1954, the parties were exchanging elaborate computations and tabulations of prices in Southwestern Louisiana aimed at being evidentiary of the controlling fact which control -- which was the standard of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.076" offset="4511640">And Your Honors can find those at 38 to 45 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.604" offset="4525746">Now, as Judge Learned Hand pointed out (Inaudible) v. Clark which we've cited in our reply brief at page 8, a standard -- a contract is not invalid because it contains or even depends upon the application of a standard which is difficult to apply provided there is, as there was here, Judge Learned Hand says a standard which is quote “independent of the will, wish or want of the parties”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.421" offset="4633057">Now, actually, prevailing prices in a particular area is not an unusual standard in the natural gas industry and has been recognized and validated as a valid standard of price redetermination by at least one court, the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.000" offset="4695333">Further, and this is very important, this standard was backed up by an arbitration provision so that if the parties couldn't agree on the fact on the application of this standard, it was nevertheless to be fixed by arbitration.Now, if the Court please, let me come to one last point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.109" offset="4791777">Mr. Justice Whittaker asked yesterday, was the letter of February 1954 a contract or perhaps, was it a contract for the purchase of gas?</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.618" offset="4865860">Because those are significantly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.011" offset="4875368">Even if it was a contract, was it a contract for the purchase of gas, and we submit it was not because a contract for the purchase of gas and Shell's own escalation clause shows, as I pointed out a moment ago, must contained provisions as to quantity quite as important term in this contract's price, quality, delivery arrangements and a host of other as the clause says pertinent fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.305" offset="4984560">These are none of these aren't contained in that letter of February 1954 nor does it purport to contain them or incorporate them by reference rather it says we have agreed on price for the next five years pursuant to the provisions of condition 3 or Article III --</text>

            <text syncTime="1355.877" offset="5526862">With respect to the judicial review issue, we believe this case resolves itself into the question of whether or not the Federal Power Commission was better qualified than the Court of Appeals to read the everyday language appearing in a privately negotiated contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.011" offset="5651414">The considerations of which the petitioners now urge in support of the Commission's order were not the considerations, were not the factors upon which the Commission itself based that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.727" offset="5738245">What was the issue in this case and how did it arrives and how did the Commission treat it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.877" offset="5778892">The issue in this case was what contract price had the parties fixed for themselves as of the critical date, June 7, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.984" offset="5847333">That was the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.748" offset="5854333">That was the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.764" offset="5862379">The issue in this case in no way involved the lawfulness of that price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.436" offset="5897070">Justness and reasonableness of the price was not involved as it would have been had this been a rate proceeding under either Section 4 (e) or Section 5 (a) of the Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.102" offset="5963734">The Federal Power Commission, unlike in the Memphis case, had no part in the formulation of the contract which it construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.138" offset="6019950">This was not a case in which the producer was seeking a certificate of public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.102" offset="6051819">Hence, the question of whether or not this price was in the public convenience of necessity was not at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.948" offset="6087137">As a matter of fact, the Commission had issued a certificate to Shell in 1946, which was the year before this proceeding -- this hearing was held before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.430" offset="6157040">The question which the Commission set for itself in our view was in no way intermixed with any question that was peculiarly administrative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.815" offset="6222660">Any question as to which the Commission had a unique expertise or know-how to bring into play that were not possessed by courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3156.770" offset="12730493">And if I'm in error, the petitioners can correct me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.944" offset="12743137">The Commission gave no weight, no consideration whatsoever to the peculiarities of the words used in the Shell contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.847" offset="12786709">It is true there were other contracts in evidence by Shell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.037" offset="12807502">And the Commission said, “Well, the way those contracts will work -- you see in these other contracts, they had “favored-nation” clauses that would apply whenever the pipeline paid any higher price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.555" offset="12865599">So the Commission said, “Shell, if it wanted its clause here to cover every higher price, could have used that language,” but that overlooks one of the fundamental significant points that we have always made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.812" offset="12930591">We do not contend that our clause is all inclusive and that it covers every increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.798" offset="12962565">We content it only covers higher prices resulting from entry in to a contract by the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.258" offset="12996420">We admit it's a limited clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.392" offset="13004988">So saying that here are some clauses that are all inclusive, to me, does not mean that every other clause is all exclusive but one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.956" offset="13051173">Now, to get back to your question, Your Honor, I am firmly convinced the Commission did not base it's conclusion upon peculiar words because you can look at -- actually what the Commission itself did in the Commission's original --</text>

            <text syncTime="3270.113" offset="13183875">As a matter of fact, in this case, the staff counsel before they examine even contended that the Commission didn't have jurisdiction to resolve this interpretation question because it was one of law for the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.819" offset="13238627">But let us look at how the Commission treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.301" offset="13256600">If Your Honors would like to see it, on page 132 of the record appears -- that's a part of the Commission's original order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.116" offset="13299858">In about one-third of the way down, the Commission says “the question before us.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.904" offset="13330996">This is in the record, I -- I -- not the brief, the record, page 132.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.810" offset="13354611">They say, “The question before us is whether the letter agreement constitutes a new contract for the purchase of gas or whether it merely represents action taken pursuant to the preexisting 1943 agreement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.135" offset="13443950">Then they say, “We believe the latter is the correct view.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.838" offset="13458683">Then skipping down about six or seven lines, the Commission says “The cases show, the cases show that a contract will not fail for want of certainty where a future price is to be fixed by arbitrators.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.057" offset="13523571">Then the Commission goes on to discuss the question not of the Shell clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.472" offset="13549275">They apparently assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.544" offset="13557530">As far as I can read the Commission's order, they assume or interpolate the word “new” into the Shell clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.768" offset="13590444">And then they say this other agreement in 1954 between the pipeline and the Atlantic was not new because it was action taken under a preexisting contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.309" offset="13644570">And the reason for that they say is that the old Atlantic contract first made back in 1943 continued through out because it contained an arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.799" offset="13702562">And they said the arbitration clause made everything all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.937" offset="13723146">Now, Your Honors, under the Shell clause, I repeat, first of all, the facts remains, these parties did not arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.318" offset="13756688">They entered after extensive negotiations that extended over five and a half -- a period of five and a half months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.153" offset="13788035">As the witness testified, they haggled back and forth and they finally reached an agreement on price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.556" offset="13817605">One side said this is as high as we are going and the other side said, “Well, we will see if we can get that agreed too.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.479" offset="13845295">And then they entered into their agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.515" offset="13869432">We believe, Your Honors, that the Federal Power Commission's construction of the Shell clause and the legal conclusion that it reaches with respect to this contract made between Atlantic and the pipeline would largely defeat one of the principle purposes of the Shell clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.754" offset="13962428">This Shell contract contains a rather comprehensive pricing arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.297" offset="13992521">The contract has one of the so-called fixed step-up clauses under which the price will go up in definite amounts at definite dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.874" offset="14030869">It also has one of the so-called price redetermination clauses but that doesn't come into effect until after the first 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.124" offset="14067858">Then it has this “favored-nation” clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.030" offset="14091473">Now, that “favored-nation” clause appears at page 66 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.208" offset="14132224">And it says that if, after the given date, the buyer shall enter into a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.755" offset="14174438">Now, Your Honors, the petitioners give a lot of emphasis not -- to the next phrase providing for the purchase by it of gas produced within a given fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.142" offset="14235982">What that language means, we believe, what the draftsman did, that language is merely descriptive of the commodity that the other contract had to govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.225" offset="14284257">A man preparing this clause said, “Well, you have to run into another contract.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.453" offset="14305155">It would have to be a contract dealing with something.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.736" offset="14314350">It couldn't be crude oil or something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.730" offset="14326262">It had to be a contract providing for the purchase of what?</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.057" offset="14343607">Of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.494" offset="14349354">Had they there intended to describe the type of contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.345" offset="14368789">I submit they would have said, “Had they entered into a new gas supply contract?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.257" offset="14400449">but they didn't do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3697.385" offset="14892910">Your Honors, let's -- let me see if I can answer that by an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.278" offset="14908479">Suppose -- and I -- and I give one I -- I mentioned a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.098" offset="14923734">Suppose in the Atlantic contract, that's the other contract, these parties had a fixed contract for 25 years at a fixed price, no escalation clause, no agreement to agree clause, nothing like that in it, just a straight fixed price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.290" offset="15000534">And in 1954, the seller went to Atlantic and said, “Look, I think this price is too low.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.257" offset="15024358">Let's see if we can do something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.040" offset="15039509">Let's see if we can agree upon a new price for it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.753" offset="15050376">So they negotiated and they haggled back and fourth and they finally agreed upon a new price, and they entered into a letter agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.291" offset="15084544">Now, that, Your Honor, I submit, would be entry into a contract dealing with natural gas within the prescribed area at a higher price, and I think that would have activated our clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.962" offset="15143267">Let me try to give another example that might demonstrate what I'm -- I'm trying to say, and I think in part may answer what petitioner said with reference to this other contract covering these various elements of quality and quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.648" offset="15214007">Now, let us suppose that in 1954, when the pipeline and Atlantic made this letter of agreement, suppose after they have agreed upon that new price of 12.5 cents, instead of merely writing a letter and saying -- and signing the letter, supposed they had said, “Well, this whole agreement is -- is dirty or torn up.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.960" offset="15319228">But for reasons of their own they said, “Let's just reproduce the old contract word for word for word except this new price we've agreed upon.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3817.229" offset="15372309">Now, that would have contained each and every one of those elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.348" offset="15396760">And if you will then concede that that meets the Shell clause, and unless you are going to permit form to govern over substance, that's precisely what they did in 1954 when the pipeline and the Atlantic, after these extensive negotiations, just entered into a letter confirming their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.331" offset="15540746">We submit, Your Honors, that when the petitioner say there are only two types of these escalation clauses, if -- if I understand their position correctly, they say the Shell clause is a so-called “new” or “future type” of clause, and it can only be activated when the pipeline goes out and enters into a new contract covering a new supply of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.100" offset="15655790">As I understand that, they say every one of these clauses is either one extreme, that is it applies to every higher price or it's the other extreme where it applies only when the pipeline goes out and buys a new supply of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.830" offset="15746696">That, Your Honors, would leave no middle ground, no in-between ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.367" offset="15768848">Suppose parties want to make another agreement like the Shell clause, here, Shell was not interested in its price increasing when the price increased to the pipeline under these fixed step-up clauses in a preexisting contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.452" offset="15841155">Shell and the pipeline had made their own bargain in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.871" offset="15858813">But certainly, parties are to be able to make other contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.712" offset="15874173">We submit the Commission's conclusion and the petitioners' position here would leave no middle ground on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.539" offset="15913566">One other thing in connection with those clauses, I would like to point out that this record shows that at the time of the Shell contract in 1951, the pipeline was also the purchaser under the neighboring Atlantic contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.469" offset="15989217">Now, as the purchaser under that contract, that pipeline certainly knew of this clause in the Atlantic contract which was an agreement to agree clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.063" offset="16035610">And certainly, it was not a price redetermination clause as the petitioners indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.520" offset="16057448">The party said they would agree upon price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.885" offset="16066957">All price would be fixed by arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.438" offset="16077093">But at any rate, the pipeline certainly knew of that clause at the time it, the pipeline, prepared the Shell clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.738" offset="16122337">Under those circumstances, isn't it reasonable to assume that if the pipeline did not want its price to increase when the Atlantic price went up under that agreement to agree clause, it would have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.006" offset="16187434">Another fact that we think of extreme significance in this case is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.318" offset="16208645">It's stated in the briefs of the Government and of the pipeline that it's very strongly to the benefit of the pipeline to limit these “favored-nation” clauses as much as they possibly can.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.676" offset="16270085">And I can't again say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.291" offset="16276564">Maybe it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4046.024" offset="16287431">It's also shown in this record that the pipeline prepared this clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.471" offset="16309269">It is further shown in this record at the time the pipeline prepared this clause, it was the purchaser under the Atlantic agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.979" offset="16351274">Now, if it had been the intention of the parties at that time in 1951 to limit this Shell clause, and if the limitation of the Shell clause in that regard was so all important to that pipeline, and since that pipeline prepared that clause, isn't it reasonable to assume that it would have done what some other pipelines have done and made it clear that the Shell price would not increase except when the pipeline bought new gas under a new supply contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.541" offset="16513546">Now, Your Honors, we have shown in our brief a typical contract at page 33, near the bottom of page 33 of the Shell brief and some hearings on the Harris Bill which was to amend the Natural Gas Act in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.654" offset="16625977">There is shown there a “favored-nation” clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.538" offset="16653563">And I would just like to read two or three lines from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.649" offset="16665997">Your Honors can -- can follow it because it shown as 3A down at the bottom of that page.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.357" offset="16692851">“Buyer agrees that if during the term of this contract, it purchases from producers new gas from new sources of supply,” and then it goes on, “in a given area that it will give the same price to the seller”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.852" offset="16774771">Under the circumstances of this case, we respectfully submit, Your Honor, had that been the intention of the parties when the pipeline prepared the clause, it certainly would have used language along that line, perhaps not that specific language.</text>

            <text syncTime="4773.020" offset="19195486">But as we explained in our brief, You Honor, negotiations were going during a quite a period of that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="4804.209" offset="19320247">Number one, despite all the argument that has been, it now emerges that there is no substantial dispute between the petitioner and the respondent as to the clause of the Shell contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.082" offset="19371656">Both agree that he calls for a post 1951 contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.292" offset="19388583">Both agree that it calls for a contract for the purchase of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.013" offset="19403421">Both agree that it calls for a contract containing -- containing terms as to quantity, quality, etc.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.378" offset="19428916">So the real question here is as to what was done under the Atlantic contract as to which (Inaudible) has been addressed except by myself?</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.720" offset="19466219">And I note that the one thing that the counsel did say is he said, “Well, they haggled back and forth and agreed on a price and this is what the witness testified to.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4849.267" offset="19500492">And that is precisely not what he testified to with great respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.888" offset="19514911">He testified that “We haggled back and forth and agreed on what prevailing prices were,” the -- i.e.the standard of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.639" offset="19549915">And once we had agreed on that, that was it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.312" offset="19560573">And further, the contract as the Commission points up, the Commission dealt with this and the Commission said, “Well, whether the -- the standard in the contract was definite enough or not, we need not consider because it was backed up by an arbitration clause,” which meant that the standard -- the applicability of the standard was assured in any event whether the parties agreed on its applicability or didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.571" offset="19665690">Now, we submit the authority's allegiant for such a contract as our binding contract on both parties and binding not from the time when they applied their standard as called for by the contract that binding ab initio from the -- to the original entry into the contract.</text>
