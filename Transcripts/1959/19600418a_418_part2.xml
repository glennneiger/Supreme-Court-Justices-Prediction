            <text syncTime="117.268" offset="572479">And there is -- there is, as I say, the record show that the misconduct was engaged in by people who were connected with the local and the International's responsibility rests upon the factors that I've indicated although as I say, the record does not show that any official of the International actually participated or that there is any showing that there was any overt instigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.425" offset="661086">Would you think, from your point of view, you think my inquiry is a relevant one?</text>

            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="146.117" offset="687835">Yes indeed it is Your Honor because as I -- I will address myself to some of the fears that had been expressed by the other side, and I think the question that you ask underlies those fears.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.546" offset="733602">Now the Board found that these tactics that were engaged in by the petitioners constituted restraining coercion within the meaning of Section 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="168.297" offset="776547">And the Board's order is couched in the language of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) which makes it unfair labor practice for a union or its agents to restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed by Section 7 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.926" offset="831091">Now the Board's order to begin with complies literally with the command of the statute, namely, that the Board shall enjoin the commission of such unfair labor practices found here to restrain and coercion of employees in the exercise of their rights under -- guaranteed by Section 7 of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.323" offset="904652">But more important, I think, the nature of the misconduct lends support to the breadth of the -- to the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.612" offset="941850">The Court would have noted that the misconduct here was directed not only against the employee and employees personnel against personnel and the immediate employee of Ohio Consolidated but the results are directed particularly and especially against personnel which Ohio Consolidated had recruited from the affiliated enterprises, affiliated (Inaudible) companies for the purpose of conducting its operations during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.276" offset="1048430">In fact it was the advent of these outsiders that precipitated in large part the misconduct in this case.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>

            <text syncTime="252.438" offset="1113109">But I think that the implications of this conduct I would try to bring out do support the breadth of the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.221" offset="1144247">Now these -- these outsiders -- these outsiders were regarded by the petitioners as strikebreakers and it's particularly reprehensible because they had taken over their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.338" offset="1192730">Now the coercive tactics in this case were not due to any unique or special circumstances peculiar to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.574" offset="1229720">We think -- we think that they evidence a purpose on the part of petitioners to intimidate anyone whether or not in the immediate employee or the consolidate company to intimidate anyone who's sought to perform services for the company during the strike and thereby impair the effectiveness of their strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.878" offset="1302862">And undoubtedly, even though the Court did not -- the Board did not specifically address itself to the -- to this problem, this must have been one of the factors which weighed with the Board, which weighed with the Board in concluding that the protection of its order should extent not only to the employees of Ohio Consolidated but also to the employees of other employers.</text>

            <text syncTime="325.446" offset="1405158">Your Honor a -- it's hard for me to give a general answer to that because the Board's orders depend pretty largely, of course, upon the special facts of the case, but there are orders -- there are orders of the Board in various types of cases where it -- the protection of the order extends beyond, beyond the employees of the immediate employer or beyond even the geographical jurisdiction of the particular local or labor organization that maybe involved and perhaps I can answer your question Your Honor best in the words of the Board itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.236" offset="1552280">Unhappily, unfortunately we didn't cite this case in our brief and I'd like to cite it now.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.757" offset="1630438">This case came down in 1954 but I think that what the Board said then is as true -- is also true of its orders today.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.456" offset="1665233">The Board had been stressing itself to this problem of the breadth of its orders and after citing this Court decision and Express Publishing Company, the Board then generalized its order – (Inaudible) generalized concerning his orders in this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.622" offset="1729912">The Board said, “Rely upon this test, namely, the Express Publishing test of like or related conduct, relying upon this test, the Board has with judicial approval extended geographically that coverage of cease-and-desist orders to protect the employees of employers other that those a party to the proceeding where the respondent unions had committed similar violations against other and unrelated employers or planned a program or had a planned program to apply the same techniques to the operations of other employers or had committed the unlawful acts during a general organization campaign in which such acts were typical.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.625" offset="1873899">However, the Board has also issued such orders in several recent cases in which they have heard to be no evidence that the respondent unions had committed similar unfair labor practices against employers other than those involved in the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.424" offset="1921024">In most of these cases the unlawful conduct occurs as a result of respondents' adherence to trade rules constitutions and by laws or agreements which conduct by reason did they expected it be continued against other persons unless enjoined.</text>

            <text syncTime="573.446" offset="2397184">However, that we have this Mr. Chief Justice that there were number of instances on which the Board of misconduct or a violence, let me say, or threats on which the Board did not rely, the Board excluded those from its consideration because in those particular instances apparently the record show -- the record shows that there had been some provocation on the part of company-employees that led to the particular misconduct in those particular instances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.494" offset="5601364">The argument has been made that in order of this kind exposes the International to concept -- contempt sanctions for misconduct in the part of any of its local conduct which the International may have neither authorized nor have been able to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.040" offset="5663535">I believe that these fears are not really well founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.029" offset="5679522">In the first place -- in the first place, the CWA, the International cannot be held accountable, legal responsible for the acts of its local except upon traditional common law principles of agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.580" offset="5733648">It must be shown that the CWA has authorized, instigated, participated, or supported such misconduct in the part of its locals and secondly as the cases make quite clear in order to get in the contempt adjudication, there must be this showing, the showing of such responsibility on the part of the -- of the International must be made by clear and convincing proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.873" offset="5826853">Now in these circumstances, I think that the fears they say which have been expressed by the CWA are not really well founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.596" offset="5857782">Finally, there's been some concern expressed, expressed that an order of this kind tends to shift the primary responsibility for administering the statute from the Board to the courts and that, the Courts of Appeals would be called upon to make initial determinations of fact and perhaps even on the law and this is an undesirable development.</text>
