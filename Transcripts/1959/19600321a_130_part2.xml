            <text syncTime="7.199" offset="132159">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.224" offset="144280">In deciding whether petitioner is the type of party member who was deportable under the 1952 provisions of the Immigration Act, I think we and the Court have to bear in mind that this was not a new statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.475" offset="213243">That it was a combination of the statutes which had began in 1917 and that was a long history of -- of judicial and administrative interpretation of that statute and that this Court itself has passed upon that issue in various cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.574" offset="289625">Going to this Court's decision in the Harisiades case, that case involved three different people, Harisiades, a Mrs. Coleman and the Mr. Mascitti.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.157" offset="332048">The record of relationship to Mrs. Coleman which is summarized by Justice Jackson in his opinion for the Court and which is of course more fully set forth in the -- in the record before the Court indicates that she was a rank and file member with far less if you want to call it activity than the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.753" offset="406340">When you get to the Galvan case, he had no more activity, no more what you might call awareness of the theoretical underpinnings of the Communist Party than the Petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.988" offset="455346">The fact is, that the statute and its predecessors have not been interpreted judicially and certainly not by Congress nor administratively from 1917 on to require any knowledge of what you might call Communist Party theory, Marxism-Leninism.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.663" offset="525981">This deportation statute of course is what I'm talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.053" offset="539564">Rather, Congress has been -- has been trying to deport people who were party members in the ordinary sense who were active in the party and the day to day work of the party who were the doers of the party as were whether they were Theoreticians or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.246" offset="600377">Galvan was not a Theoretician, Mrs. Coleman and Mascitti in the Harisiades cases were not the theoreticians.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.342" offset="628694">Mrs. Coleman didn't purported not even to know who Joseph Stalin was.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.461" offset="645204">“He is a Russian”, she said.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.248" offset="652413">“Is he a Russian?”</text>
            <text syncTime="138.466" offset="657220">And the answered to the question, “Do you who Joseph Stalin is?”</text>
            <text syncTime="142.367" offset="672789">The important thing as far as Congress has been concerned, as far as this Court is concerned, why is that person, a member of the Communist Party, as distinguished from some other organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.042" offset="715525">And was he or she a member of the Communist Party in the ordinary sense in which somebody is a member of the party, knowing that it is a party and that of course, we believe is what -- what petitioner did here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="424.240" offset="1800338">The distinction I made Mr. Chief Justice is that in the Rowoldt case where the Court had only Rowoldt's own statements before them and nothing else; that it was not satisfied that Rowoldt joined the Communist Party has a party, as a political party.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.835" offset="1862719">It wasn't satisfied that he hasn't joined it -- that he didn't join it solely for -- for -- to gain his own livelihood, as if he were a -- a method of obtaining a necessities of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.268" offset="1920397">Now, that was not true of Galvan and it is not true of this petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.896" offset="1938996">This petitioner was an active party member.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.369" offset="1948818">He was a -- a member of the executive board of his branch -- of the executive board of his branch, he went to this Plenum in -- in Aberdeen, Washington and on page 12 of the supplemental record, the witness Wilmot testifies went on at the Plenum in summary.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.205" offset="2020185">And what went on was a discussion of the activities of the Communist Party particularly he say -- he said, “In relation to promoting the party in the lumber industry.”</text>
            <text syncTime="487.769" offset="2054457">In other words, they were carrying on the activities which the Communist Party was carrying on as a party in that region at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.455" offset="2097194">To us it makes no difference whether petitioner here was a theoretician or understood Marxism-Leninism.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.590" offset="2125720">Congress wanted to get those who were the supporters, the doers, the -- the active helpers as well as those who were might call the party theoreticians.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.462" offset="2161246">In fact, when Congress passed the statute in 1940, which overruled Kessler against Strecker it didn't overrule, it changed the law which had been laid down in Kessler against Strecker.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.919" offset="2203042">As the Court will remember Kessler and Strecker, the court held that until they said, Mr. Justice Roberts for the Court said, ‘Unless we are given a more specific indication by Congress, we will not hold that a man who has been a member of the Communist Party no matter how far in the past or for how shorter time will be portable under the statute and may held that the statute related only to present the membership in the party.”</text>
            <text syncTime="549.967" offset="2303248">In 1940, Congress changed that and the -- and the committee reports are explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.586" offset="2325713">They say in obvious reference to the language of the Kessler against Strecker opinion that a person is deportable for no matter how for membership, for no matter how shorter time or how far in the past so long as it was after the date of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.590" offset="2385690">No matter how far in the past or how short the time and in the Harisiades case, the Court have reported three aliens one of whom left the party in 1929 and the other two in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.695" offset="2446190">I might say that the leaving of the party in 1939 may have some other significance, we don't know because as the Court pointed out on the Harisiades case, the Communist Party at that time gave instructions after Kessler against Strecker had been decided, that all aliens were to leave the party so they would no longer be subject to deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.945" offset="2527169">And there been a large number of cases involving leaving the party in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.596" offset="2545768">I think more cases involved that one year than any year that I'm familiar with and of course, this petitioner left the party according to the record in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.002" offset="2591431">As I've indicated, it makes no difference how shorter time under a congressional mandate the man was a member of the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.937" offset="2619120">And of course, as the Court has twice held upon the Harisiades and Galvan and I think quite correctly under the history and stretcher statute, it doesn't require any knowledge by the alien of the unlawful or objectives of the Communist Party that advocates the overthrow the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.486" offset="2701354">Congress has been so insistent upon the deportation of present and past members of the Communist Party that in 1950, it refused to apply the suspension provisions to persons in this category at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.645" offset="2770004">They were not suspendable at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.172" offset="2780035">In 1952, in one of the perhaps few alleviating portions of the McCarran-Walter Act suspension was granted to people in this category.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.420" offset="2825070">But Congress retained for itself the final say and it required a 10-year period of good conduct before it took a man to even be eligible to deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.586" offset="2873762">What I mean by that is this; Congress provided with respect to certain types of deportable aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.429" offset="2897063">That if the Attorney General certified that the man was -- should be -- should have his deportation suspended that went into effect unless one House of Congress affirmatively acted contrary to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.513" offset="2953383">And in some cases, and most to those cases they provided only for a five-year period of good conduct to just doing of the act which require the deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.862" offset="2990791">But with regard to the so-called ‘subversive aliens“ including past members of the Communist Party, it required a 10 year period of good conduct and provided that there should be no suspension of deportation unless both Houses of Congress affirmatively vote to suspend the deportation otherwise, the statute says, the Attorney General shall deport the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.737" offset="3074278">So, Congress has been strict.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.830" offset="3086712">It has been very severe and it has reserved to itself the alleviating, the merciful power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1988.861" offset="8058859">Question, do you -- question, “Do you remember what was said about what's done in that particular occasion?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.141" offset="8079966">Answer, “Well it had to do largely with circulation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.420" offset="8093027">That was a perfect place for people to come and sit and I don't attribute any great sinister significance to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.462" offset="8121240">And I also attribute no particular significance to this plenum and I'm coming to that in a moment which is more than Mackie -- than this witness' testimony that 12 years before, somebody -- it saw this man at a Communist Party meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.550" offset="8181530">But if you look at page 8, where he mentions the plenum, he's asked, whether or not he ever attended any Communist Party meeting outside of Portland that Mackie attended?</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.075" offset="8223640">And he says, “Yes, one in Aberdeen.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.507" offset="8233357">They said, “What kind of meeting was this?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.025" offset="8243493">And this is -- this -- I don't, this -- as it seen to me to be terribly sinister important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.057" offset="8263555">Answer, “It is what they called a plenum.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.751" offset="8278392">It was merely your report of the work that was carried on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.039" offset="8291558">A plenum means of fullness literally, it was the report work that was carried on by people in the northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.101" offset="8315800">And then if you look at page 13, where it goes over it again, not 13 – 12, the only thing they could -- they asked in the purpose of meeting and he repeats in a rather colorful account that he says, everybody would get up and give -- give a glowing account of what they had done, there were more or less fabricating he says, and the only person he can remember, is a man by the name (Inaudible) speeches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.355" offset="8420812">There is no evidence that the petitioner made speeches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.036" offset="8435545">The evidence amounts to the fact that he went to party meetings if you accept that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.098" offset="8459786">Now, let's take a look of the man that knew him, that really knew him and was a member of his -- his unit according to his testimony, what he said about him and you have a very different picture than what Knight said, look at page 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.867" offset="8542856">Question, “Did Mr. Mackie in your presence ever advocate to overthrow of Government by force of violence or the use of the illegal means.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.250" offset="8568351">Answer, “No he never did.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.388" offset="8576920">Question, “Would you say to your knowledge that Mr. Mackie was one of those people who was more particularly interested or concerned with the problems that faced the country during to the depression such as unemployment and relief?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.583" offset="8617671">Answer, “I think very much interested than top of 29.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.607" offset="8633762">Question, “Was he what you would call one of the party intellectuals?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.976" offset="8647241">Answer, “What do you mean by that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.400" offset="8656959">Question, “Was he very much on theory, political discussion?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.618" offset="8669811">Answer, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.125" offset="8675871">Question, “He is more interested in bread and butter topics at the day, what to do for unemployment relief?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.881" offset="8694888">Answer, “I would say so, yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.857" offset="8702830">Question, “Was most of the activities (Inaudible) branch toward these specific problems?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.973" offset="8719235">Answer, “Yes they were,” Now look at the summary on page 30, in which the attorney asked the witness, if this the correct summary of Knight's testimony?</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.096" offset="8759777">Question, “You saw Mr. Mackie the number of meetings that you claim were close meetings to the Communist Party that he was not functionary of the party, that you yourself thought members the works of the Soviet Union is the educational chairman of that group but that Mr. Mackie did not participate any of the discussions that you held in that connection, that Mr. Mackie did not distribute literature and the Mr. Mackie never served under you -- under your direction in any capacity, and that as near as you know, Mackie never attended any Communist Party conventions, is that correct?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.022" offset="8887463">Answer, “Yes, that's right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.225" offset="8896240">And then later on, “Is that correct summary of your testimony as far as I went?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.191" offset="8908152">He says, “Yes that's right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.584" offset="8917661">Now, these are people who were testifying 12 years after the events and you're now always little pieces of unexplored odds and ends and I think the principal reason it wasn't explored was because the Rowoldt case had not been decided and people didn't understand that the nature -- of the activity and the significance of the membership was as important as Rowoldt later made clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.038" offset="9027480">But the least the Board of Immigration Appeals could have done is before they had hatched to these little grids and drafts, as soon as they're kind of sinister significance that Mr. Davis gives to it, I think, completely unwarrantedly would be to reopen the record so they -- people could try the issue with some knowledge of what the issue was about at the time they took this testimony from Knight, from Wilmot at the time the petitioner testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.101" offset="9131760">They didn't know what the interpretation is going to be that was given in Rowoldt.</text>
