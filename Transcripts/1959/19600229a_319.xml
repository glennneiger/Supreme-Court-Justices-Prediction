            <label>Mr. Henry I. Fillman</label>
            <text syncTime="999.335" offset="4100681">Now the Administrative Procedure Act, Mr. Justice Whittaker, starts out in Section 10 by saying, "Except so far as statutes preclude judicial review."</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.359" offset="4160763">And that's at page 46 of my appendix to the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.983" offset="4171316">It says "Except so far as statutes preclude judicial review or agency actions by law committed to agency discretion."</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.762" offset="4210395">So, looking at the language there, the question is not whether a statute precludes judicial review, but the question rather is, to what extent does that statute preclude judicial review?</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.241" offset="4268387">That's the language except so far as.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.205" offset="4280195">Now, Section 7 (c) which says that “The sole relief and remedy of any person having any claim to property shall be that provided for by this Act, could have no relation whatsoever to a claim under Section 32 for these reasons, first, it was enacted in 1918 and had as its purpose, the speedy capture by the Alien Property Custodian of enemy property which he had vested by a vesting order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.720" offset="4442258">It was to prevent litigation and delays in getting that property into his hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.755" offset="4478412">Now, when the Trading with the Enemy Act was enacted in 1917, the Custodian had the right to seize, but persons who held property here instead of turning over the property which was vested, forced the Custodian to go into court to get it, because they claimed there was no enemy interest in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.694" offset="4566183">In order to (Inaudible) the delays that followed or resulted, Congress amended Section 7 (c) in 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.866" offset="4626787">And they there provided by a speedy seizure of the property pursuant to the vesting order and any non-enemy who claimed there was no enemy interest, could then by the sole relief and remedy provision, go into court under 9 (a) to get his property back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.333" offset="4724694">He had to give it up before suing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.458" offset="4737233">He couldn't as theretofore sue and hold on to it until the Court decided in favor of the Custodian, that, it was back in 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.987" offset="4771297">That has nothing to do with a Section 32 proceeding, which came on years later in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.803" offset="4814555">Now, Section 32 was first enacted in March 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.454" offset="4841200">It originally provided for a return of vested property to what are called the technical enemies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.078" offset="4871711">They were the residents of Holland, Denmark, the occupied countries, France, whose property was seized for two reasons, to protect them, protect the reasons and secondly, to prevent Germany from having those assets available to be used against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.054" offset="4955617">Now, when the war was over, there was no need to hold on to those assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.714" offset="4978186">Section 32 was enacted to provide a return to those people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.893" offset="5010996">It provided in subdivision (5) that before a return be made, there would have to be a determination that the return was in the interest of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.046" offset="5059584">Now, that's a broad term, but the purpose of including that provision was contained in the records, Mr. Thorp, who was then the Assistant Secretary of State, informed Congress, I have mentioned it in my brief that the purpose of the interest of the United States provision was to make certain that the property returned to a so-called “technical enemy,” would not be returned to a German for whom that technical enemy was acting as a cloak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.718" offset="5206288">It was to prevent the cloaking situation because some of these people might have been cloaks for the Germans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.591" offset="5253726">And then, the other reason given was, in the congressional hearings, to bar a return to a technical enemy wherein the judgment of the State Department -- for example, insufficient reciprocal protection had been afforded by a foreign country to American citizens having claims against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.981" offset="5335333">Now, several months later, they further amended Section 32 (a) (2) (D), that was on August 1946, by incorporating therein the first proviso of Section 32 (a) (2) (D), to return to those persons whom Congress said were in fact, the enemies of our enemies, the persecuted groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.902" offset="5463019">And we filed our claim or the petitioner did on this, the first proviso of Section 32 (a) (2) (D).</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.686" offset="5498128">Now, Congress clearly said that these people should get their property back, that's the language used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.099" offset="5551731">And we say that if the petitioner comes within the condition of status laid down in that first proviso, he is eligible to be considered for return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.278" offset="5620485">Now, we say the District Court has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.157" offset="5640025">It has jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.026" offset="5659460">And apart from the Administrative Procedure Act, it has it under the Declaratory Judgment Act and the general grant of federal question of jurisdiction for the District Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1427.030" offset="5811493">I, myself, must decide whether if this case goes back and the District Court holds for you and then it would have to go back to the Attorney General and he would have to decide whether the return is in the interest of the United States, if by a singe word, “no,” William P. Rogers, Attorney General, that concludes the litigation because that -- if the answer to that is, yes that his, no, is final and not reviewable, that has a good deal of bearing in my mind regarding the judicial reviewability of (d), because I wouldn't suppose that Congress meant to say that you could go in and have litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.642" offset="5997902">To have a contest, way up to the Supreme Court and back and decide, “Yes, he comes within (d),” but the Attorney General by his (Inaudible) can say, “You can't have it, because it's not in the interest of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.274" offset="6044505">So I don't think one can say, “We're not qualified to decide that now.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2271.881" offset="9190902">It is the position of the Government which the Government has maintained consistently ever since 1944 when the predecessor of the bill which eventually became Section 32 when the Trading with the Enemy Act was first introduced with Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.714" offset="9266239">The Government has maintained its position ever since then that there is no judicial review of determinations made under Section 32, that the District Court, as the Court of Appeals or this Committee have found here and as that court had found in four previous cases involving the same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.956" offset="9363205">The District Court had no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.209" offset="9376162">We think this is true, first, because a fair reading of the language of the Trading with the Enemy Act demonstrates that there was to be no judicial review under Section 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.145" offset="9427989">We think it is true, second, because a fair interpretation in the legislative history of Section 32 also demonstrates, there is to be no judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.833" offset="9474696">In the third place we think it's true because a fair interpretation of the whole pattern of the way that Congress has dealt with seizures of property of enemy aliens or to the Trading with the Enemy Act supports this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.342" offset="9532792">And finally, we think it is true because there were very strong reasons of policy which undoubtedly influenced Congress here in not providing for review, in believing there should be no review and those reasons of policy we think are -- are persuasive.</text>
