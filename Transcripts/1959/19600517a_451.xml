            <text syncTime="29.035" offset="219512">This case is here on a writ of certiorari from the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.376" offset="244903">And the case arose in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.941" offset="259114">In 1941 and 1942, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company carrying 75 shipments of iron and steel articles for the account of the United States from various points in the East to the port of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.974" offset="331316">The shipments were consigned to that port for export.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.379" offset="348871">Because of conditions created by the war, they were not exported to that port but stored for a while in New York and then they sent it elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.259" offset="384397">Some of them ultimately went to Canada, some of them were ultimately exported to other ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.185" offset="404146">The controversy in this case relate to the charges and only to the charges, or no shipments from the point of origin to the port of New York versus the set of charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.283" offset="452524">They are under the tariff --</text>

            <label>Mr. Hugh B. Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="91.487" offset="469347">They were changed afterwards, Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.838" offset="486693">There were two sets of rates that might have been applied to these shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.036" offset="503515">One, were the ordinary domestic rates on iron and steel article, the other were lower export rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.424" offset="537057">The Railroad billed the United States on the basis of the higher domestic rates and the Unites States paid for the shipment on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.777" offset="582510">Subsequently, on post audit by the Controller General, he decided that the United States should not have been billed on that basis but it -- it should have been billed on the basis of the export rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.120" offset="647816">He took the position first that the -- in the conditions that applied to these shipments, the export rates under the tariffs were applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.323" offset="684701">And alternatively, he took the position that any rate higher than those export rates as applied to these shipments would have been unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.762" offset="730467">He therefore deducted under the procedure provided for in the post-audit statute from freight bills admittedly owing to the Railroad an amount equal to the difference between the domestic rates and the lower export rates that came to approximately $7237.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.368" offset="824822">The Railroad then brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.866" offset="850840">There was a report by a Commissioner, an argument before the Court of Claims and then to Court of Claims, held that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction as laid down by this Court in the Western Pacific case in 352 U.S., required the Court of Claims to suspend its proceeding until the Interstate Commerce Commission could decide what rates should lawfully and properly be applied to these shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.757" offset="954389">The Court of Claims entered an order suspending the proceeding and directing the United States to institute a proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission to have that question determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.280" offset="996498">United States instituted that proceeding by all the petition, asserting alternatively that the export rates should apply on -- that they didn't apply any rate higher than those rates, was unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.469" offset="1049266">There were -- the case was sent by the Commissioner to an examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.617" offset="1069850">Before the examiner, the United States abandoned the position of the -- the export rates were applicable and relied solely on the ground that the -- any rates higher than the export rates were unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.300" offset="1132544">The examiner made a report favorable to that contention of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.432" offset="1153128">Exceptions to the report were overruled by Division 2 which entered an order discontinuing the proceeding and a petition for a reconsideration was denied by the whole Commission.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="273.402" offset="1197014">I take it that the question of whether export rate of parts, the rates couldn't be higher -- the reasonable rates couldn't be, or a rate higher than the export rates would be unreasonable, was itself a subject matter for the so-called family jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.432" offset="1257096">As I think there's no doubt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.036" offset="1271515">The United States then went into the Court of Claims and filed a motion asking the Court to vacate the suspension of the proceeding and to enter judgment for the Railroad in the amount of approximately $1635.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.114" offset="1339852">That was the amount of the total amount sued for in the Court -- Court of Claims which represented charges which the Interstate Commerce Commission had found to be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.400" offset="1388962">The Pennsylvania Railroad then filed a pleading in the Court of Claims resisting this motion and asking that the Court of Claims suspend the proceeding in the Court in there until the Railroad could file a proceeding in an appropriate District Court under Section 1336 of Title 28 to review and know and suspend and set aside the Commission's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.584" offset="1501706">The United States resisted that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.055" offset="1515604">However, while the case was still in the Court of Claims, the Pennsylvania Railroad in fact did file such a proceeding in the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania invoking the jurisdiction under -- to that Court under Section 1336 and laying venue under Section 1398 of the same title.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.176" offset="1800025">The Court of Claims thereupon, without any further hearing and without purporting to review the order of Interstate Commerce Commission, entered judgment for the Pennsylvania Railroad in the smaller amount which had been suggested in the motion filed by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.015" offset="1887483">It said in its order, wrote no opinion, but it said in its order that it did not think that in this case, the procedure of staying for further action in the Court of Claims until review by in a District Court was an applicable procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="593.942" offset="2479104">In the first place, because Congress has provided, the District Court shall review orders of the Commission, in the second place, because the Court of Claims has no jurisdiction to review an order of the Commission.</text>
