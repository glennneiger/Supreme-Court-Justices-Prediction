            <label>Mr. Arthur Lazarus, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="28.960" offset="219199">Mere -- mere consent expressed in a statute is -- is the way I phrased it, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.376" offset="240828">And I think we can find the answer to that in two places.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.957" offset="255248">One of the places is in an 1871 statute which is codified as 25 U.S.C. Section 71.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.771" offset="298506">This is not cited in the briefs except in one footnote in my brief, which says that henceforth, no treaty shall be made with Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.373" offset="348871">And thereafter, Congress has dealt with Indian tribes on the basis of statutes frequently incorporating an agreement into the terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.852" offset="394742">In terms of decisions of this Court, there is the decision in Lone Wolf against Hitchcock, which is cited in our brief, I believe, at page 75.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.320" offset="448658">The citation is 187 U.S. 553, the 1903 decision, in which this Court held that Congress, by a statute, could abrogate a treaty with an Indian tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.030" offset="523473">Insofar as Indian affairs are concerned, the decisions of this Court and the practice of Congress seems to have been that statutes are raised to the same level as treaties, and that a subsequent statute can override an earlier treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.669" offset="594004">So now the treaties are no longer made, the will of Congress, and in this particular case, the consent of Congress is expressed in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.703" offset="638203">Now, of course, the expressed congressional consent cannot be found in the 1957 Act authorizing the power project.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.148" offset="679999">But the -- the whole case of United States, as I understand it, is that that Act made a draft or authorized a plan to be made and the practically, the feasibly, the appropriately effective and only effective way of carrying out that which the Act of 1957 contemplated was to include portion of the Tuscarora Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.211" offset="796191">Needless to say, I'm not contesting that I agree with that but that's the case and that's the case that has to be met.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.071" offset="1123662">But even assuming that it were, there is still no reference here that nobody looking at this map, at least no average Congress and then looking at this map could possibly deduce from this that Indian lands were caught.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.113" offset="1243826">But this does not tell either the congressmen or anyone else where that reservoir is going to be located because a 60,000 acre-foot reservoir can be built in an infinite number of ways.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.354" offset="1540786">In other words, the January 30, 1958 licensor, which is what this appeal is based on, when that came out, the Commission said “alternative lands are available”.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur Lazarus, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="372.621" offset="1593866">And then it went up to the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals reversed or rather remanded for a very limited purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.373" offset="1632841">The Court of Appeals remanded for the sole purpose of finding out whether the 4 (e) finding could be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.944" offset="1663143">And it said, “Come back to us within 15 days.”</text>
            <text syncTime="394.071" offset="1679653">Now, the Commission noticed this for hearing and it set the hearing down on the issues presented in Section 7 of the Court of Appeals' opinion, and the issue in Section 7 of the Court of Appeals' opinion was solely the 4 (e) finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.209" offset="1756244">And it was not until we got before the hearing examiner that we began to get into these myriad other issues about alternative lands and their community disruption and so forth, and what kind of use Tuscarora is made of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.210" offset="1812250">All of these things completely irrelevant to what the case was remanded for.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.903" offset="1830954">So it's my basic position, one, that the finding of the Commission with respect to necessity in February of 1959, which sheer dicta was completely outside of what the case was sent back to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.088" offset="1911724">Now, even assuming that the Commission had a right to make some kind of statement, they did not say and they have never said unequivocally that this land, Tuscarora land, is absolutely essentially to build the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.132" offset="1971911">What they said was this land -- that the community disruption expense and delay make it unfeasible to take the alternative land.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.850" offset="2010781">Now, I would like to show you just a little bit about that alternative land, because the Commission's 1959 finding had nothing whatsoever to do with facts that existed in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.082" offset="2059682">The Commission's 1959 statement had to do with facts that existed in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.028" offset="2087476">Now, for example, we have these expensive homes here, I believe, that was the Solicitor General's phrase, expensive homes that would have to be either moved or destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.622" offset="2125824">Now, a good number of those expensive homes were built in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.088" offset="2143692">Now, what this has to do with necessity in 1957, I don't understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.009" offset="2171382">In addition to that, mind you, the alternatives were presented only by the Power Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.481" offset="2197295">And the Power Authority, we can well imagine, just put this in context, was not going to come up before the Commission on the remand and say, “Yes, alternatives are available because we, the Power Authority, had been building it the other way for a year and a half.”</text>
            <text syncTime="539.640" offset="2261974">And they certainly were not going to come up before the Commission to try and prove that alternatives could be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.983" offset="2291336">So what they did was, they took this area in here, 1695 acres, and they used it as the constant.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.728" offset="2322265">That's what they've been working on.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.632" offset="2329893">And there was no variation in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.531" offset="2341491">So that when you eliminated this area on the Tuscarora Reservation which they claimed they needed, then we got to their artificial configuration just to where else they might go.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.114" offset="2387780">But the fact is that in considering this 1695 acres, they kept not only the surface area but the height at constant and the reason they kept the height at constant was because they had ordered several million dollars worth of machinery for generators, etcetera, which they said they could not change.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.425" offset="2469073">It would not take a higher reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.668" offset="2478059">So all of the evidence before the Federal Power Commission is based on activities after January of 1958 when the license was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.735" offset="2518288">And all of this great expense, great delay, great communities disruption is caused solely by the fact that the Power Authority abandoned every possible alternative in 1957 and went ahead notwithstanding this litigation to build a project as if it were going to get Tuscarora land.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.626" offset="2597909">Now, after the Federal Power Commission held against the New York Power Authority, the New York Power Authority came in with an application for an amended license.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.961" offset="2639182">And now, for the first time we learn that we can raise these dikes by 15 feet and still use the machinery that was on order back in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.156" offset="2680038">So we don't need to take 1721 acres, and we don't need to take 439 homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.557" offset="2709608">We can raise the dikes here by 15 feet still using their machinery to take maybe 400 acres in there and get a 60,000 acre-foot reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.425" offset="2749106">So that there is, on the facts, absolutely no necessity for taking Tuscarora lands even using their facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.656" offset="2777945">And of course, their facts are 1959 facts, not 1957 facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="863.665" offset="3558066">With respect to individually allotted lands within Indian reservations, they get treated some other way.</text>

            <text syncTime="956.440" offset="3929109">I think we have to agree if we look at the statute that Congress intended to deal with Indian lands under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.233" offset="3964322">It referred to them in Section 3 (2), it referred to them in Section 10 (e).</text>

            <text syncTime="975.176" offset="4004028">Now, the Government's position boils down to this that -- that Indian lands that Congress was intending to deal with in the Federal Power Act are only Indian lands which the United States may dispose of under the Property Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.403" offset="4080933">And I submit, Your Honor, that if we accept that construction, we eliminate virtually all Indian lands in the United States from the Act, because what kind of Indian lands do we have nowadays?</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.497" offset="4141328">We've got, let's say, in rare instances, the type of Indian reservation that was under consideration and before this Court in the McGowan case back in about 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.886" offset="4194931">This was land that the United States had purchased with gratuity funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.954" offset="4211231">It was on the public domain or there with private land in the State of Nevada, had been purchased with gratuity funds and set aside for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1036.638" offset="4249893">I would have to concede that is land owned by the United States, but the number of acres in that category is infinite (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.885" offset="4282911">We have some reservations set aside by executive order where the Indians occupying it have only aboriginal rights and which, as against the United States, are non compensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.266" offset="4332440">But the bulk of all Indian reservations in the United States are reservations today where the Indians have recognized titles to their lands, either by virtue of treaty or by virtue of statute or by virtue of some form of recognition by the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.399" offset="4404955">And it has been the consistent rule in this Court that where a tribe has recognized title to its reservation lands, it has a compensable property interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1133.437" offset="4637132">It has to invoke some other source of authority to dispose of the Indians' interest, because that is not property of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1803.428" offset="7317086">Now, I would like, in the -- in the minutes remaining to me, to deal with the arguments that the Government advanced with -- with respect to the 1957 statute in terms of consent by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.161" offset="7395976">Now, this argument is founded upon three cases, Henkel against United States, Spalding against Chandler and Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway Company against Roberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.456" offset="7453236">Now, I'd like to take the last one up first before it's the only points to mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.067" offset="7471626">This case is cited by defendant at page 53 and -- pages 53 and 54 of its main brief for the proposition, and I now quote, “The taking of Indian reservation land was authorized by the grant of a railroad right of way which 'necessarily involved their possession' despite absence of any showing that Congress had been aware of that necessity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.572" offset="7585625">Now, without getting too deeply into the facts of the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway Company case, I would like to call your attention to this Treaty of September 29, 1865, the Osage Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.891" offset="7638915">Now, these lands, what was involved in Missouri, Kansas case was a grant of land to the State of Kansas in aid of construction of a railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.082" offset="7683741">And that grant run through the Osage Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.241" offset="7696384">And it's the Government's argument that by necessary implication and without congressional knowledge, the taking of the Indian lands is authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.086" offset="7747688">Now, the grant to the State of Kansas was the Act of July 26, 1866. I would like to call your attention to the fact that about nine months previously in 1865, the Osage ceded the bulk of the lands covered by the grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.125" offset="7815920">In Article 11 of the treaty of cession specifically says “Any railroad company, when the lines of their roads necessarily passed through the lands of said Indians, shall have the right of way upon payment of fair compensation therefore.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.387" offset="7892929">Now, this Treaty came up before the Senate on June 26, 1866, that is 30 days before the grant for the State of Congress -- State of Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.200" offset="7952175">And the Senate amended the Treaty to provide that the ceded lands could be sold under public landlord and then they added this proviso, “including any act granting lands to the State of Kansas, an aid of the construction of a railroad through said lands”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.652" offset="8030020">So my point here, Your Honors is, with respect to the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway Company case extends for the exact opposite proposition as that which was cited for by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.368" offset="8072861">View with expressed congressional knowledge and expressed congressional provision for taking care of Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.842" offset="8102745">Now, the Henkel case is distinguishable on about half a dozen grounds which involved a voluntary sale for one, for two, it involved individual property not tribal property, for three, actually, the Indians didn't have any rights, they hadn't any inequities, and four, whatever equities they had where under a statute which granted the United States the power to take the lands for public purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.694" offset="8198144">Insofar Spalding is concerned, the -- what the Government cited and dictated to begin with, in addition to that, there, in the Spalding case, we had a specific grant of a specific right of way to a specific company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.295" offset="8268570">That is not what we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.880" offset="8274944">In this case we have just a mere general authorization of the Federal Power Commission to issue a license for non-federal instrumentality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.933" offset="8311097">So this dissent by implication argument as the Government tries to run just doesn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.409" offset="8337011">There was no authority for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.936" offset="8371075">Now, I also would like to deal very briefly with an argument made by the Power Authority Industry not made by the Government and understandably so that the decision rendered by the Second Circuit in this case is somehow binding it on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, that the Second Circuit decision would be related litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.690" offset="8478177">The Power Authority argument is based upon a complete misconstruction of what the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.099" offset="8507747">The case before the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was an injunction proceeding against the appropriation of Tuscarora lands while the review could be independent down here in the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.511" offset="8565426">What the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decides and (Inaudible), if the Power Authority has a valid license, it may be gambling to get back to the question of 10 New York Section 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.620" offset="8629896">But of course, the basic premise upon what -- which the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was operating is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.195" offset="8660198">The Power Authority is not a valid licensee and therefore, anything that the Second Circuit has to say on this subject would -- may go out of the window.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.215" offset="8700217">Now, of course, as Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out in his opinion when we came up with question of stay on the Second Circuit decision, the issue of the validity of the license and the applicability of Section 4 (e), Tuscarora lands is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the District of Columbia Circuit, the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.189" offset="8800110">By statute, Section 3 -- 13 (b) of the Federal Power Act which vest exclusive jurisdiction in the reviewing court and of course, is also in accordance with the opinion of this Court in the City of Takoma case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.028" offset="8871476">So that's what we have is -- is argument to the effect that the Second Circuit in someway foreclose the court below in dealing with the issue in this case is just not based upon any principle of law announced by this Court or announced by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.900" offset="8954964">Beyond that, I have no further argument in this Court.</text>
