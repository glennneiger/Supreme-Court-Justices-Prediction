            <text syncTime="30.593" offset="225782">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.224" offset="248247">In this case, the Court postponed further consideration of request in the jurisdiction until this hearing on the merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.483" offset="289311">We have discussed the manner of jurisdiction at length as the first question in the brief on the merits and we do request consideration here.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.720" offset="350229">Appellants have alleged the questions of jurisdiction in this kind of setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.285" offset="404564">In this case, six Negro appellants who are citizens of Greensboro, North Carolina, had been convicted of the crime of criminal trespass for peacefully playing golf on the public municipal golf course of that City.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.977" offset="515323">And appellants are under a 15-day jail sentences imposed under Section 14-134 of the General Statutes of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.533" offset="581465">Appellants alleged first in the motion to quash and then in the motion to set aside the verdict, the motion to quash being incorporated also in the motion to set aside the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.179" offset="648129">That this statute in this case has been and is being unconstitutionally applied to these appellants because it is being used to implement by prosecution and jail sentences, the denial of certain constitutional rights of appellant under the Fourteenth Amendment and also in the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.177" offset="804028">In that -- first in this case on the question of racial discrimination, the trial court was put upon notice in the motion to quash that the position of the defendants there, appellants here, was raising a question of racial discrimination and when the trial came on, the trial court in this case close the mouths of the State's agencies who were in operation and control of this golf course by refusing to permit them to divulge what they knew and it's -- we believe what the State knew as to the operation of this golf course, so far as the exclusion of Negroes from participation and discrimination against them in play upon this golf course</text>
            <text syncTime="252.079" offset="1111646">Those actions of the trial court found on pages 45, 48, and 78 of the record, where on page 45, the appellee's agent (Inaudible) who was the assistant golf pro in charge of the golf course, when appellants sought to play, testified that no Negro had played on this golf course, insofar as he knew and when -- but that some had sought to play and when he was asked to tell why they have not played, the trial court would not permit him to testify with reference to why Negroes had not played on the golf course.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.393" offset="1360959">On page 48 of the record when the golf pro and manager of the golf course himself, was on the stand -- and by the way, his testimony shows that he had been the golf pro and manager from the time the golf course was first opened in 1941, down until the time of this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.007" offset="1471404">He was not permitted by the trial court even to tell whether or not any Negroes had played on the golf course, to say nothing of while he had not played.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.141" offset="1539950">As of those two witnesses, it's our view that they knew more about the question of racial discrimination on this golf course than anybody else and that it was virtually preventing the appellants, defendants there, from proving by the State's own agents, whose knowledge we believe of knowledge of the State, that there was in fact racial discrimination and exclusion from this golf course.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.648" offset="1713925">Now, on page 78 of the record, the president of the golf corporation which was found to be insofar as I know, there's no dispute as to that golf corporation being an agency of the State, it appeared that he was a witness in a case in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, which I shall discuss shortly.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Alston Atkins</label>
            <text syncTime="448.288" offset="1896573">His name is John R. Hughes.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.421" offset="1909008">He was the president of this golf corporation which was in control in management of the golf course.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.650" offset="1961984">He had testified in a case in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, involving the identical acts of playing golf which held to be a crime in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.192" offset="2056129">And the appellants, defendants there, undertook to show by this witness that what he testified to in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.194" offset="2116106">And the trial court refused on this ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.132" offset="2139930">Appellants have sought to call him as an adverse witness when the State rested this case without calling him and the trial court refused to be permit -- to permit and to be called as an adverse witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.435" offset="2221119">He had been subpoenaed to bring the bylaws of the corporation which he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.506" offset="2237419">And so the defendants, appellants here, put him on the stand anyway and to try to prove what he knew better than anybody else, in turning -- concerning the operation of this golf course and he had been the chief witness through which racial discrimination and the mechanics and the actualities of operating the golf course have been proved in the federal court case to which I will come in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.429" offset="2393109">And because the appellants, defendants there had -- had called him, when State rested without calling him and when the federal court refused to permit and to be called as an adverse witness, I think the record shows clearly that he was hostile.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.753" offset="2478373">The trial court would not permit the appellants, defendants there, to prove anything in the transcript of the record from the federal court by this witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.828" offset="2538663">We think that the Court has jurisdiction to review the question of whether or not, these actions of the trial court do implement a denial of due process by preventing the defendants' files here from proving that case there and hence, preventing them from proving the question of racial discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1216.826" offset="4970663">And that's why I think that the first point was -- we think the first point was important at the same time that he was saying that racial discrimination was not involved and could not be used to keep defendants from playing on the golf course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.453" offset="5041194">He was refusing to permit the golf pro and the assistant golf pro, to tell why no Negroes had played on the course.</text>

            <text syncTime="1319.865" offset="5382875">Well, there is a rule of exclusion which this Court asked about that with reference to the proof of racial discrimination, since it is very difficult to prove except by laws or doing of discriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.643" offset="5489977">That is not necessary as I understand the rule in such cases Hernandez against Texas and Eubanks against Louisiana and others, that when the defendants in this case, appellants prove three things, first, that they are members of a group, a clan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.891" offset="5550895">Second, that some of them have the same qualifications that other people have or permitted to exercise these public rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.878" offset="5578898">And third, that over a long period of time, no member of the class has been permitted to enjoy his right that that makes a prima facie case which then the State must met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.996" offset="5631352">And we do not think they merit as required under -- under the decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.320" offset="5668655">All the testimony which they offered to me, it was the testimony of the assistant pro applied whereas he said, “The reason I didn't let them play was that this was a private club for members and invited guests only.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.239" offset="5740335">We think that that's much weaker than in Hernandez where five jury commissioners in the presence of a prima facie case testified that they had used only their best judgment in selecting the best qualified jurors and where the judges in charge of the selection of jurors -- grand jurors, I believe in Eubanks, testified that they were just trying to get their best qualified people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.437" offset="5877112">Now, that test order was held to be insufficient to meet the prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.287" offset="5900518">We think that that is adequate if evidence in the record -- aside from they exclude -- the excluded evidence, but we think that it was a -- a denial of this constitutional rights to say in one breath that racial discrimination has nothing to do in the next breath that you cannot prove it.</text>
