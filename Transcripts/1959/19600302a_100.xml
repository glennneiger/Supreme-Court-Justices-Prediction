            <text syncTime="24.259" offset="200391">The inquiry as I understand it, Mr. Justice Black, was that assuming that there is a showing in this record of a purpose -- of a purpose and effect on the part of the demand made here by the telegraphers to negate and frustrate orders of the State Commissions approving and authorizing the Central Agency Plan, what would be the relevance of that showing?</text>

            <text syncTime="200.136" offset="903920">Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked Mr. Schoene yesterday whether he considered that this contract demand, it had become effective would operate as against the directions and authorizations of a State Commission order and I think it is quite clear from the language of the strike circular that I read yesterday at some length that they did not make this demand for the -- just to be ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.299" offset="1024606">They were -- they said to the membership, we have tried to defeat this Central Agency Plan on its merits before the State Commissions.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.667" offset="1070059">Therefore we have to strengthen our agreements and I think you recall I underlined emphasis of that language, therefore we have to strengthen our agreements by bringing into being something which will do the job of -- of opposing, and frustrating and preventing the carrying out of this Central Agency Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.612" offset="1157831">It's also quoted in our brief the language of the -- of the strike call issued one week after the second commission had acted namely, Iowa in which the strike call says, I quote from memory, “but with the need for this rule has been tragically demonstrated again.”</text>
            <text syncTime="285.968" offset="1247274">What happened in South Dakota has now happened in Iowa and there's no assurance that it will not happen in the other States.</text>

            <text syncTime="310.211" offset="1344240">I would think there are many things that could happen before there becomes a legal order which could be negotiated about.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.495" offset="1377364">Now that might not come within the meaning of the crucial section of the Act, but I would think there'd be many things that you could negotiate about as to whether you would go actively and requested on what position you would take, whether you had resisted if they asked for it in a legal way, and resisted legally and so forth.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl McGowan</label>
            <text syncTime="381.658" offset="1630020">Mr. Schoene yesterday emphasized that the management had taken the position that this demand was not a proper demand under the Railway Labor Act and that we do not have to recognize it as an eventual legal basis of a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.651" offset="1697938">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.749" offset="1702327">Mr. Heineman testified directly in the record that he could not recognize this demand for bargaining purposes and the reason for that was that if we had recognized it as a proper demand under Section 6 by bargaining about it formally, when the -- when the purely voluntary procedures of the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted and if the litigants were still standing firm on this demand as we had every reason to think they were going to be, we could not presumably have into a Court and sought to enjoin the resulting strike on the ground of the impropriety of the demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.506" offset="1853419">At least there would have been a serious question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.851" offset="1862823">I certainly know what position the laborers would have taken in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.013" offset="1875466">They would have said, "Well you recognize the demand is proper, you bargain about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.974" offset="1891244">The purely non -- non-compulsory procedures of the Railway Labor Act are now completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.817" offset="1914650">We have the right to strike and you can't enjoin them because you at the very beginning recognized the propriety of it."</text>
            <text syncTime="457.847" offset="1934712">So rightly or wrongly, for legal reasons we felt that we could not protect ourselves by any action which recognized propriety of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.204" offset="1968149">If we had stopped there -- if we had stopped there and remained adamant, then I would say that we would be in a very different posture before the Court than what we are.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.101" offset="2007751">One of the facts in the record though at length -- we didn't stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.528" offset="2025514">The record shows that Mr. Heineman within a few days after the Iowa order -- the South Dakota order, the first order came down, talked to his director of personnel and to me about the question of whether we should not open negotiations, discussions with the telegraphers to see whether they would not be interested in some of kind of an arrangement which would take care of the men who might be adversely affected by this order and the later orders which we hoped to get although we had no assurance at that time and facilitate their transition from non-productive employment to productive employment with the least human injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.376" offset="2188831">That was the occasion on which the decision was that the next chance to see Mr. Lye would be in Madison, Wisconsin where he would be testifying in opposition to the Wisconsin plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.044" offset="2227597">That was ten days away.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.038" offset="2235538">It was decided that Mr. Heineman would formally approach Mr. Lye on that occasion and ask him whether he would be interested in conferring about the Central Agency Plan either with respect to South Dakota or a system-wide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.947" offset="2303143">Mr. Lye didn't say, "Get back in the channel of the Railway Labor Act and bring it up to mediation."</text>
            <text syncTime="558.284" offset="2336475">He said, "We are too far apart, there is no purpose to be served."</text>

            <text syncTime="578.089" offset="2415679">Is there anything in the findings of fact that the District Court dealing with the relation of the demand of the telegraphers to the Central Agency Plan, in the findings of fact?</text>

            <text syncTime="597.772" offset="2494464">The only finding which the telegraphers have ever relied upon as supplying that kind of a finding is number -- is number 10 really and I'm excluding, mind you those findings of fact which I regard as conclusions of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="620.841" offset="2586728">Under Section 10, the Court found on the date of July 10, 1958, the telegraphers submitted to it's membership on the property a strike ballot seeking the views of the membership as to whether a strike should be authorized if necessary to secure a satisfactory settlement of a dispute arising from the proposal of the telegraphers to add to the existing agreements with the plaintiff, the rule proposed under Section 6 of the notice that I referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.296" offset="2688606">I accepted that finding on the ground that it tended to characterize what the strike or what the demand was addressed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.864" offset="2738866">And Judge Perry said, "I'm not interested in characterizing in anything.”</text>
            <text syncTime="663.232" offset="2756315">I said -- I said defining is in conflict with the language of the strike circular which indicated that they had a purpose to -- to strike at the Central Agency Plan and that's what this lawsuit is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.785" offset="2806471">He said, "I do not characterize it at all except as a strike ballot."</text>
            <text syncTime="678.882" offset="2818905">They had the word circular in first and he said, "Strike the word circular and leave it a strike ballot seeking the views of membership."</text>
            <text syncTime="685.655" offset="2845968">And the higher court in reviewing this matter has the exhibit in front of it that was the -- what I read them yesterday, that whatever attachments are there - “the importance” he said, “the importance of this finding to me is the sending around of a strike ballot.”</text>
            <text syncTime="700.873" offset="2906885">Now I proposed findings of fact and one of those findings of fact was a finding that the strike of -- that the contract demand was aimed at the Central Agency Plan and that this lawsuit arose out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.936" offset="2987133">Judge Perry decided to work from the -- from the defendant's findings of fact which as I said had no representative to the Central Agency Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.786" offset="3022555">You could have read the whole findings without knowing what the (Inaudible) of the Central Agency Plan and the only reference to it came in because of my suggestion that he at least ought to add a finding that we were willing to bargain about the Central Agency Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.518" offset="3069471">He said, "As to my findings," now I think -- he didn't take them up when -- and when he said that -- I think for the record, I should probably deny it, but he said these things.</text>

            <text syncTime="2315.526" offset="9365504">We brought an injunction suit against that order in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.651" offset="9389955">Statutory review was not a available because the commission was sitting on our motion for reconsideration which is a prerequisite to statutory review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2341.091" offset="9467695">When that suit was filed, the South Dakota Commission amended its order expressly to declare that it was not intended in anyway to interfere with collective bargaining under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
