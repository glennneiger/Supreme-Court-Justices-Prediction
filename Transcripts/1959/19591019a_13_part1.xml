            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="33.566" offset="237589">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.244" offset="272384">This case comes here from the Sixth Circuit and involves construction of provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.027" offset="323480">Shortly after the decision below came down, the identical issue came before three other Courts of Appeals those of the Third, Fifth and Ninth Circuits and all three of those courts have expressly disagreed with the result which was reached in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.150" offset="427969">And presumably to resolve that conflict, this Court granted the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.900" offset="454928">The issue is a narrow one and the facts of this case are very simple and I take it undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.530" offset="497455">For the years 1947 through 1940, respondent taxpayer, who incidentally is an attorney, failed to file a declaration or estimate, as it is sometimes called, of income tax, pursuant to the now familiar requirements under our scheme of pay-as-you-go income taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.354" offset="616782">This failure to file the declaration was willful and without any reasonable cause or excuse in the statutory sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.280" offset="660459">There are specific findings as to that by both the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals at record 8 and 16, respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.612" offset="705808">I pause to mention in fairness to taxpayer that there is no suggestion that the reason for the failure to file the declaration was a tax evasion or a fraudulent motive, rather it appears from this and from other cases as well in which the taxpayer has been involved, that the reason for non-filing was a desire to bring a test case in which taxpayer might challenge the constitutionality of the federal income tax laws in their present form.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.341" offset="860766">In any event, taxpayer was liable for taxes in fairly -- in substantial amounts in each of the years involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.285" offset="896502">And the question here is simply what additions, what additions to tax were properly imposed by the Commissioner by virtue of the taxpayer's delinquency in the respect I've indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.230" offset="964315">The Government's position, which, as I say, has the support of three circuits and the Tax Court, is that respondent was liable under the statutory scheme for two distinct additions to tax in each of the years involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.352" offset="1036831">Whereas, taxpayer's position, which was adopted below and has also been followed by a number of District Courts, is that the statutes permit but a single addition each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.719" offset="1098271">And that brings me, of course, to the statutory provisions themselves and to the pertinent Treasury Regulation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="270.985" offset="1187297">On top of the 10%, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.744" offset="1198373">I think to give the scheme, I -- I need to indicate the various addition provisions though only one of them is here in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.304" offset="1240586">Those provisions are set out beginning at page 29 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.751" offset="1266395">The first one in point, Section 294 (d) (1) (A) which is at the bottom of 29 under the caption, “failure to file declaration,” that provision provides in substance that if there is no filing of the declaration unless such non-filing is excused by reasonable cause, there shall be added to the tax 5% of the amount due, but unpaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.357" offset="1408815">And then the provision goes on to state that each additional month of that delinquency continues, there shall be an additional 1%, but not to exceed an aggregate of more than 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.527" offset="1461478">And that provision I shall refer to as the 10% penalty provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.754" offset="1494392">I used the term penalty because this addition is intended to apply as the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.962" offset="1523231">Only where there is fault where there is lack of excuse a -- a willful or defiant failure to file the declaration and also of course, because the 10% figure is itself, obviously a -- a penalty kind of figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.306" offset="1588642">It has not been an ordinary interest charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.505" offset="1605360">Subparagraph (B), which immediately follows on page 30, is not involved in this case as such, but perhaps calls for a brief word to give the full picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.577" offset="1661680">And it provides in substance, that if a declaration of estimated tax has been filed, unlike the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.341" offset="1692714">If one has been filed, but the installments thereunder have not been paid in accordance with the declaration, that once again additions which may aggregate 10% maybe imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.647" offset="1746004">Here again, the breach of duty is excused, if it's shown that there was reasonable cause for the non-payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.248" offset="1780381">And this provision is of course, alternative to (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="422.297" offset="1792606">This applies when there's a declaration and no payment thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.039" offset="1811519">(A) covers the situation where there has been no declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.175" offset="1832103">I come now, then to the third addition provision which is set forth in a separate section.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.683" offset="1874108">This is 294 (d) (2), which is captioned, “substantial underestimate of estimated tax.”</text>
            <text syncTime="452.342" offset="1912769">And it is the application of this provision which -- which gives rise to the exact dispute that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.979" offset="1963238">As the caption indicates, this deals with the situation where there has been a substantial understatement in the declaration or a “substantial underestimate”.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.102" offset="2011826">A -- an underestimate incidentally, is deemed substantial under this statute, if the final tax as figured at the end of the year, exceeds by more than 20%, the amount which the taxpayer has estimated.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.837" offset="2082670">Now, if there is such an understatement, the statute provides that there is to be added to the tax 6% of the difference between the final tax and the estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.080" offset="2135646">In short, if a taxpayer's final tax liability of $1000 and he has estimated $800, he has satisfied the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.768" offset="2170441">If he estimated $500, the provision would call for an addition of 6% of the difference between $500 and $1000.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.817" offset="2206595">Now this addition, as we view it, is in the nature of an interest charge, though it is designated like the other, an addition to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.523" offset="2249435">The important consideration to note here, I think, is that this provision applies irrespective of whether there is fault or no fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.641" offset="2293948">There's no provision in -- in this section for excusing the addition to tax.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="557.495" offset="2333341">Well -- perhaps not on this very section that there is a provision, is there not, that provides as follows, if my tax last year amounted to $500, even if my tax this year is going to amount to $40,000, if I filed a declaration based on last year's estimate, I'm completely insulated from this penalty or this interest, I'm I not?</text>

            <text syncTime="586.450" offset="2449220">But that is not a -- the answer to the reason that is so, is because that is not a substantial understatement as defined in the tax effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="595.384" offset="2484955">But this -- this is also true even if I -- it's irrelevant even -- that -- that I had knowledge that this year my tax was going to be $40,000, is it not?</text>
            <text syncTime="604.437" offset="2521109">It's to the -- after the Government to show that even.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="606.684" offset="2530095">Well, this -- the provision to which Your Honor refers is designed to give taxpayers who find difficulty in estimating.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.823" offset="2570637">A means of meeting the requirement and if they estimate last year's tax, they have satisfied for purposes of this addition provision statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.944" offset="2611179">Similarly, a taxpayer can elect to file an estimate every three months on the basis of his experience for that quarter of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.613" offset="2649840">He can annualize his tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.634" offset="2661857">The point I was making is that if there is a substantial underestimate as defined in the statute, then there is no defense of reasonable cause or over side or mistake, or other form of excuse.</text>

            <text syncTime="656.025" offset="2727476">Well, it's part of my question only went to your argument that this amounts to interest, because under my supposititious case, I could knowingly be withholding $38,500 of money due the Government for a substantial portion -- period of time and -- and be liable for no interest whatsoever, isn't that true?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="684.141" offset="2839907">Because of the definition and because Congress wanted to take care of the taxpayer who -- whose business was such that he had special difficulty in estimating.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.744" offset="2878360">I think if in fact, a taxpayer can estimate and he knows that his income in the current year is going to be substantial -- substantially higher, I think it's questionable whether he should take advantage of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.790" offset="2942516">Because he is required to set out his estimate over a declaration that these facts are true to the best of his knowledge and belief and while the addition provision doesn't apply in terms, I doubt if that provision is intended for his benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.800" offset="3026526">The point I was attempting to stress is that I think the 10% provision is designed to deal with the situation where there has been a specified breach of a particular requirement and that breach has been knowing and willful.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.574" offset="3113671">Hence, it applies only where there is fault for willfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.001" offset="3131329">Whereas, the other provision is apparently designed to compensate the Government in the situation where has not received a reasonably accurate estimate and according -- and payments in accordance therewith.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.021" offset="3203427">And that latter provision would apply to a taxpayer who perhaps had a perfectly good excuse for not filing a declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.567" offset="3253687">The 6% addition would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.932" offset="3263091">Similarly, the 6% addition applies to the taxpayer who has filed a declaration, but one which is inadequate, even though there was no willfulness or willful neglect in making the inadequate estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.348" offset="3332786">I'd like to refer the Court at this point to the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.426" offset="3357027">I -- I might perhaps say, one word first.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.528" offset="3369462">The taxpayer's argument is essentially this.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.728" offset="3386284">That where a taxpayer doesn't file a declaration or estimate, there can be no underestimate -- having been no estimate, there can be no underestimate.</text>

            <text syncTime="980.346" offset="4024717">And the crucial sentence in that regulation is the last sentence appearing on page 34, “In the event of a failure to file the required declaration, the amount of the estimated tax for the purposes of this provision is zero.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.836" offset="4110712">Now, this regulation was adopted in 1943, very promptly after Congress in the Current Tax Payment Act of that year, adopted the scheme of pay-as-you-go income taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.231" offset="4280299">I referred the Court to the sentences or regulation which takes care of this case precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.271" offset="4308407">The Sixth Circuit viewed that aspect of the regulation as invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.304" offset="4336619">It said that it didn't consider the regulation to be consistent with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.581" offset="4365667">Now, we urge that it is at least a permissible interpretation of this statute that the concept of substantial underestimation is broad enough to cover the case of the taxpayer who has substantial income, but fails to estimate that any tax at all, is due.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.119" offset="4447796">And the three other circuits which have passed upon the question have said, “The statute is not free from ambiguities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.582" offset="4477680">That it is necessary and proper to refer to the history and to the consistent administrative practice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.803" offset="4506624">And they have concluded that that history in practice compelled the conclusion that Congress contemplated that the 6% addition was applicable in situations where no estimate was filed as well as to situations where an inadequate estimate was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.782" offset="4578513">Now, in that premise, let me refer the Court very briefly to the relevant history which we set out at 19 and 20, of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.579" offset="4633684">I would call the Court's attention particularly to one sentence which is quoted on page 20 and appears in both the House Committee Report and the Senate Committee Report on the Current Tax Payment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.610" offset="4697840">And that sentence is this, “In the event of a failure to file any declaration where one is due, the amount of the estimated tax for the purposes of this provision,” And the discussion there was the addition for substantial under estimation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.937" offset="4767117">“For purposes of this provision, will be zero.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.496" offset="4781328">And so, we have a case here in which the Treasury Regulation was adopted verbatim from the Committee Reports of the two Houses of Congress.</text>

            <label>Mr. Fred N. Acker</label>
            <text syncTime="1805.521" offset="7325445">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, may it please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.169" offset="7356061">I would first address myself a little out of order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.553" offset="7373615">Justice Stewart asked a question where a man had a return or an income of $2500 in a certain year and the following year he had $50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.929" offset="7431084">Under the law as it is enforced now, there would be no penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.645" offset="7457938">Now, if I understand correctly and I'm willing to be corrected on the proposition, because the statute requiring a declaration involved a prophecy, that is a main at the beginning of the economic year, had to prophesy two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.668" offset="7530036">He had to prophesy what his taxable income would be and that involved a double guess, it involved a guess by him as to what his income would be and it also involved a much more difficult guess as to what the tax rate would be when Congress got around to enacting the tax for that particular year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.368" offset="7624808">Therefore, the courts in interpreting this provision, this reasonableness provision ignored the expressed wording of the statute and they said that, “We, as a court, won't construe any man who does that as having complied with the statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.804" offset="7702549">In other words, this was a case where the statute itself was so extreme that the Court by a long series of decisions avoided or voided the effect of this statute in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.626" offset="7761899">And finally, after they magnified and buildup and multiplied, I think the Commissioner then said, “That we will accept that definition and I think that that is the history of that situation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.870" offset="7814875">Now, I want to go to a point that counsel was making his very last point that he made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.794" offset="7846536">And he was saying there that there would be a situation in which a man could be in complete default and he wouldn't pay any penalty and that situation grows about in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.241" offset="7908289">The man files no return at all, that is no estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.870" offset="7926888">And therefore, strictly speaking, he should pay a 10% penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.080" offset="7943711">But if he could show that that was reasonable, he would escape that penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.225" offset="7964296">Then we come to the second provision, the so-called 6% provision and since he had filed no estimate and since it's very difficult to underestimate something that he didn't file at all, that you can't file an estimate and not file at -- you cannot file an estimate and file an estimate that's an understatement at one of the same time, this man would be excused from the 6% penalty under my definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.126" offset="8071920">Now, counsel says that that is an ambiguity, but in that he airs, “Because that is not an ambiguity, it is an omission by the drafter of the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.945" offset="8131166">It's some omission to cover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.881" offset="8138898">It's not an ambiguity, it's an omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.914" offset="8151019">And of course, you can't create a liability, because the drafter of the Act created an omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.737" offset="8186337">So he calls it by the wrong name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.322" offset="8196681">He didn't cover all of the possible situations that could exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.908" offset="8214967">And therefore, what he's complaining about is not an ambiguity, he is complaining about an omission.</text>

            <text syncTime="2105.405" offset="8524988">In the Conference Report, there is such language, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.743" offset="8542333">Now, let's get down to the essence of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.319" offset="8552678">Here, we have an exceedingly simple statute, an abstract legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.107" offset="8583816">And we have a requirement on the Income Tax Law that said, “That you must file a declaration and they created two kinds of penalties, just two kinds of penalties for two possible situations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.305" offset="8640554">The man who says, “I will make no report” and the other man who makes a faulty report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.445" offset="8665109">And judging the weight of those two defaults, they'd say for the major default which is in defiance of the law itself, we'll make it 10, but the man who does it just badly, we will make it 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.369" offset="8720802">Now, if you will read the statute, I defy anyone to get any other conclusion out of it or any other possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.104" offset="8759777">The wording is plain, it is unmistakable, it is -- I go so far is to say, it is inescapable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.695" offset="8806170">And therefore, I say, Your Honor, there can be no resort either to the Conference Report or to the regulations because there is, in fact, no ambiguity and the entire brief, some 27 pages or some 34 pages of the Government's brief, turns entirely around the proposition that there is an ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.139" offset="8915884">But they fail in any respect to point out what the ambiguity is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.923" offset="8939081">What is the ambiguity?</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.762" offset="8946395">Where is the ambiguity?</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.115" offset="8959875">There might be an -- an omission in a very extraordinary situation, but there is no ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.122" offset="8987878">And therefore, if I understand the law of the land as interpreted by this Court and by all of the state courts' interpreting statutes, if there is no ambiguity in itself, if we can get it from the four corners of the statute, then we have no resort either the Conference Reports or the regulations of any kind and that is the essence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.944" offset="9075127">And therefore, this Court after examining the expressed language of that statute, before it could begin to examine the Conference Report, or to examine the regulations, or to examine any of -- of the arguments, would've first have to find that there was in truth and in fact, an ambiguity.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="2498.168" offset="10095992">Because we got no mind of Congress -- we got no mind of Congress.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="fred_n_acker" startTime="2500.963" stopTime="2772.828">
            <label>Mr. Fred N. Acker</label>
            <text syncTime="2500.963" offset="10107173">But when you are trying to reach in -- have been searching to the mind of what the Congress was, you have to pay some attention to the type of an enactment that it was, when you have a single statute or a simplified statute that's one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.935" offset="10175091">But when you have a large comprehensive statute, which even the Internal Revenue department doesn't understand, then you got a definite situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.627" offset="10213857">Now, they make another contention that the enactment has stood there and that is that -- their interpretation has stood there, all of these intervening years and of course it has stood there in these intervening years, but not without controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.121" offset="10279894">Now, they contend that since Congress has let it there, that we should interpret it in the light that the Government has interpreted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.154" offset="10332035">But there is another doctrine of the law that follows along that, that the Congress pays attention to what the courts are deciding on the same subject, so we have parent -- parent thoughts that are running along parallel one to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.418" offset="10400998">And of course, if that is true, if the Congress pays attention to that, they will find that the Tax Court was making decisions more or less supporting the Government's contention while the District Courts were not doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.379" offset="10456900">And it is only recently that it has got into the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.197" offset="10476126">So that I don't see how you can come to any conclusion that might go to another proposition that the Internal Revenue Act is a very hot subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.770" offset="10526490">And Congress is constantly saying we will -- we will examine, we will examine it, but they don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.569" offset="10549687">At least they do not go into it in the very thoroughgoing manner and next November 5th, theoretically for about the eighth or ninth time, we are supposed to have a further thoroughgoing revision or study of the Internal Revenue Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.523" offset="10609455">But we'll have to see how thorough that is, but you can't give any great conclusion from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.700" offset="10638190">Now, let's go to the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.680" offset="10654072">Well, when this first came up, I made a very thorough digest of the cases and what did I find?</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.513" offset="10689390">I found out that there was absolutely no meaning in any of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.539" offset="10709556">In other words, the cases were about something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.598" offset="10721782">They were about fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.920" offset="10727006">They were about technicalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.597" offset="10733798">They were about bookkeeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.424" offset="10741112">And then at the very end of the decision, the Court would say, “10% penalty inflicted, 6% penalty inflicted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.716" offset="10770265">No meaning, no explanation, no reason why.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.809" offset="10790640">And to show you that that is so even in the decisions, let's take the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.288" offset="10812479">The Sixth Circuit on three occasions, sustained the double penalty, the 10% and 6%, and then reversed themselves in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.156" offset="10883950">So this was called to there attention in the Patchen case, which was decided after the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.529" offset="10909445">So the Court took a look why they did this and they looked at the records and they found out that it was in the pleadings, but not in the briefs and counsel didn't argue it, so as a matter of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.961" offset="10967228">And therefore, that means nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.762" offset="10994395">Now, let's get down to the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.555" offset="11025638">The Government attacks, be it 767% in one year, 83% in another and I was objecting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.514" offset="11065448">And the Government's contention was that they had a right to tax even though it was confiscatory, even though it was destructive, even though it was excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.615" offset="11121873">Now, that is a quotation not from me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.370" offset="11132844">They were -- are not words that I pulled out, but they were the substance of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.214" offset="11160221">And they were adopted by the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.538" offset="11169520">And when the thing was argued in the Circuit Court, they repeated that contention.</text>
