            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 53 Clifford M. Davis versus Virginia Railway Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.366" offset="264861">Mr. Davis you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry E. Howell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="43.204" offset="276146">Mr. Chief Justice and honorable associate Justices, the petitioner in this case is a railroad employee, a yard conductor, who was injured while attempting to carry out his duties incident to a switching movement at the Ford Assembly Plant in North of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.793" offset="370500">He is complaining of two actions of the Court below, the first the Court deprived him of a Jury Trial with respect to the liability of the railroad insofar as how this accident occurred and the railroad's breach of duty under the Federal Employer Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.256" offset="460361">The second question is a little more intriguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.194" offset="476139">It cites as error of the lower Court's decision in holding as a matter of law that the doctor employed by the railroad to treat this injured employee was not an agent or an employee within the contemplation of FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.569" offset="553671">Now the first question we feel is boiled down to three charges of liability but with respect to the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.460" offset="609259">Number one we feel that the record is clear that a jury question was created with respect to the amount of time that was allotted to the performance of the particular train movement involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.377" offset="668923">Number two, we feel that the petitioner was furnished inexperienced personnel and three we feel that an improper work area was furnished him with respect to the condition of the right of way immediately adjacent to the track.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.022" offset="735483">Now, how did this accident occur?</text>
            <text syncTime="175.046" offset="803506">The Ford Motor Company took a 30-minute lunch period.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.917" offset="827016">While their employees were eating lunch they weren't at the railroad to spot the railroad cars containing the parts necessary to assemble the automobiles at certain predestined spots inside of a house shed.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.125" offset="895875">The car had to be exactly positioned opposite this opening in order to comply with the requirements of the Ford plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.339" offset="932760">The railroad in an attempt to accommodate its customer allotted only 30 minutes for a shifting operation which without -- substantial contradiction and certainly the evidence is to be viewed in the light most favorable to the petitioner in the view of the deprivation of the right by jury, the evidence was that with two inexperienced brakemen, it would require from an hour to an hour and ten minutes and that even if the brakeman were experienced which is not the case here, it would require approximately 50 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.479" offset="1085315">So the railroad was creating a situation that involved haste by a necessity in order to accommodate the Ford plant they were requiring a job to be done in half the time that ordinary prudence would suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.775" offset="1162428">Now on this particular day this yard conductor who ordinarily would give his signals from the ground to his brakeman had been furnished with two young men who had never before in their lives spotted cars within the house shared of the Ford plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.410" offset="1237034">On page 51 of the record, Mr. Pennington, the so called senior bake -- brakeman was asked, “Did you know how to spot cars in the house?”</text>
            <text syncTime="293.521" offset="1277471">“No sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="294.614" offset="1281860">“Did you need any assistance on the morning of July 03, 1957?”</text>
            <text syncTime="299.699" offset="1302131">“Yes sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="300.664" offset="1305997">“Whom did you ask to assist you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="302.824" offset="1314670">“Peanut.”</text>
            <text syncTime="303.518" offset="1317491">“Speak a little louder we can hardly hear you, Mr. Davis”, that was the yard conductor.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.857" offset="1346748">Now we have even more interest, Mr. Pennington states what Mr. Davis was attempting to do at the time that he slipped from the grab-on of the car and caused his injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.938" offset="1531173">“Do you know why he was coming back?”</text>
            <text syncTime="326.944" offset="1531068">Mr. Davis had been walking in consistent with this 30 minute work schedule that created a climate of haste; he was walking along the top of these freight cars to get to a position where he could assist this inexperienced brakeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.012" offset="1530964">When he reached the gondola car which required him to come down the side of the box car and hasten up and then get up on the next box car and continue on to his brake work.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.707" offset="1538173">“He was coming back there with me to show me where to spot cars.”</text>
            <text syncTime="362.524" offset="1553429">“When did you last see him?”</text>
            <text syncTime="363.649" offset="1557922">“I seen him when he come to the gon.”</text>
            <text syncTime="365.414" offset="1565027">“What do you mean by gon, gon door?</text>
            <text syncTime="368.480" offset="1577253">”“What do you mean by gone done door?”</text>
            <text syncTime="370.001" offset="1583417">“Yes sir that is the lower car from the box car.”</text>
            <text syncTime="373.092" offset="1595747">“What if anything did he have to do when he came to the gondola?”</text>
            <text syncTime="376.050" offset="1607555">“He had to come down and run up ahead and catch a car that was higher so he could walk on back to me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="382.972" offset="1635244">“Were you asked to do anything out there that day or directed to do anything out there that day prior to the time that this accident happened that you were unable to do?”</text>
            <text syncTime="393.129" offset="1675891">“Yes sir, I made quite a few mistakes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="396.779" offset="1690520">Now here was a yard conductor, given a job to do in 30 minutes, given two men that had never before spotted cars and he -- within this climate of haste he was doing everything he could to comply with the requirements of the -- of the customer of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.397" offset="1760946">He was going back to this inexperienced brakeman when he slipped from the romp of the ladder.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.908" offset="1782993">Haste makes waste and this waste was created by the railroad in requiring an unusual schedule for this particular involved movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.477" offset="1833253">We've already alluded to the inexperience of the personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.650" offset="1853942">With respect to the improper work area, the evidence in the record is --</text>

            <text syncTime="482.128" offset="2031888">That in the -- in the record is page 51 if I'm not mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.378" offset="2080893">He had -- page 52, question; “what if anything did you have to do when he came to the gondola and had to come down and run up ahead and catch a car that was higher so he could walk on back to me?”</text>
            <text syncTime="508.239" offset="2136377">Now if the Court pleases, when you set a schedule of 30 minutes to do something that would ordinarily require you to do in an hour, you must be in a climate of haste during that whole period of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.230" offset="2200325">You're working under a pressure that is just as if this Court had to decide 20 cases between now and tomorrow and write opinions for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.545" offset="2241599">The Court would have pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.109" offset="2247764">It would be doing everything it could to fulfill this deadline that for some reason was imposed and we would create a situation which would be similar to that which was imposed upon Clifford Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.047" offset="2303561">Now there we think is the heart of this case even though we have a third point with respect to point one.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.957" offset="2331251">Namely, that the Act was passed by Congress in anticipation that -- that the requirements of the industry, the requirements of the railroad would create a hazardous situation and here the railroad choose -- chose to satisfy the customer at the expense of a safe working condition, a safe place to work, a safe climate in which to work and when they chose to satisfy the customer at the expense of the employee, then the Act seeks to afford the broadest of coverage to the worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.926" offset="2471058">Now just in passing the improper work area of the evidence is uncontradicted that the right of way alongside of a track should be flat because men are descending from the cars to the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.987" offset="2523303">And here we have a situation where one witness testified that it was tantamount to a drainage district that was on page 59 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.090" offset="2571682">All witnesses testified that the earth left to the side of the track that had a 45 degree angle.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.745" offset="2598327">Other witnesses described that condition is being rough and they all agreed that it should be flat.</text>

            <text syncTime="635.181" offset="2644093">Dr. Thiemeyer, if the Court pleases testify that -- just -- on page 31, force exerted on an obliquity -- obliquity usually offers more stress, more force.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.522" offset="2801455">He testified that by landing on a 45 degree slope, this man's entire weight was pushed down on his toes and even though he only dropped a distance of 15 feet that by applying all of his weight forward at an oblique angle that that would create an unusual and -- and far more stress than if it had been on a 15 feet, I mean if it had been on a straight surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.498" offset="2905318">Now the Court took over as it -- as the lower court did in many places of these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="877.195" offset="3612191">It's a -- it's a point of national importance and in my humble opinion in the application of the Federal Employers Liability Act and I frankly feel that the device is somewhat insidious that has been adopted by the railroad industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.997" offset="3667362">And that is the position of a doctor employed by a railroad in the business of the railroad of adjusting claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="2179.830" offset="8822680">Now then on at the bottom of page 19 he was asked, is that a normal customary position in using this type of ladder and he answered, it sure is yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.502" offset="8877432">So he is on the ladder in a normal customary position having walked there getting ready to get down and without any further explanation his feet slipped off and he fell and the only reason that we have in this record for that having happened is that it might have been grease on his shoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.799" offset="8950575">On that record he suggested this Court with reason can say that -- that -- that his fault was attributed to by the defendant's negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.826" offset="8998640">Those facts to that extent are uncontradicted or completely uncontradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.091" offset="9035734">That's how the accident happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.548" offset="9045556">Now then the plaintiff's counsel suggests theories under which it may be found that there was a jury question and one theory is that he was ordered or required by his orders to do work in an unsafe manner and to abandon safety precautions and in doing so he was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.188" offset="9128103">In the first place the record is clear that he never abandoned any faith -- any safety precaution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.822" offset="9150673">Under his own testimony, of course there was no suggestion that he ever did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.564" offset="9177631">He walked, he assumed the proper position on the ladder and the only suggestion for his fall was his own, that it might have been grease on his shoe, the ladder was not bent and there was no other movement by the train or his fellows which contributed in anyway to his falling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.113" offset="9251819">And the other theory on the -- the next part of that theory of petitioner's counsel is that notwithstanding the fact that he -- he did in fact take his safety precautions, nevertheless we -- we are forced to deal with the various reasons why he says his orders are quite in -- not to take the safety precaution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.070" offset="9335620">Very briefly, I want to refer to two points, two places in the record in reply to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.903" offset="9375013">I wanted to be understood clearly by this Court that the theory upon which plaintiff is relying is that his orders required him to abandon safety precautions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.209" offset="9432168">Now then he was doing a job which other conductors had done before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.494" offset="9449305">And he was told the day that he went out there to take over this job which was a month prior to this accident to get these trains -- get this transfer made during the lunch time of the Ford Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.999" offset="9499355">He ascertained that that lasted 30 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.197" offset="9512208">He says that that was a 30 minute requirement on him, a limitation on him requiring him to abandon safety precautions if necessary in order to accomplish that job within those 30 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.529" offset="9565497">On the other hand, the other conductors who had operated their job before him were asked on page 35; are you ever required to do more than you would to do, than you would do to operate safely?</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.126" offset="9631848">And the answer, no sir, and the plaintiff himself was asked at greater length beginning on page 21 the following questions after he testified that as to what his instructions had been he said in response to these questions, question - he did not tell you that you had to meet that schedule even if it meant for you to abandon safety precautions, did he?</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.211" offset="9756191">Answer - no sir, no he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.818" offset="9770611">And it is your job to do whatever your operation is and at the same time to observe safety precautions for yourself and your men, isn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.241" offset="9812302">And then that question was repeated and his answer, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.998" offset="9831320">And when you are assigned to do a particular task, that assignment means that you do that task while observing your safety precaution, does it not?</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.464" offset="9865279">Answer, you have got to work as rapidly as you can and try to be safe while you're doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.462" offset="9889207">Question and trying to be safe while your doing it and if you reach a point where it is necessary to abandon safety, in order to do a certain thing by a certain time, you just have to go slower, don't you?</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.158" offset="9943960">Answer, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.648" offset="9953991">Now then his theory is that his orders required him to abandon safety in order to do a certain thing by a certain time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3515.067" offset="14163675">Well he said that -- I believe he said and some other conductors said that if -- if he had more brakemen he wouldn't have been on the car in the first place, that was his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.822" offset="14198680">The fact is that he had as many brakemen as it had ever been on that job and the fact remains that merely because he was up on the box car where he normally and customarily was during the course of his duty is not considered causative of his falling off.</text>

            <text syncTime="3548.132" offset="14295855">If the Court pleases I think that the confusion of counsel in interpreting the record shows that it's uniquely a jury trial here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.522" offset="14325426">One thing that I stated in my opening address was that on page 52 of the record the reason why Mr. Davis was going the way he was, was stated by Pennington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.137" offset="14375894">Pennington had never before done this job and he says whose duty it is to spot cars?</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.809" offset="14406614">It's me and do you know why Davis was coming back?</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.810" offset="14426572">He was coming back there with me to show me where to spot cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.403" offset="14444962">That's the very involved movement he didn't know what to do and that's clear in the record if Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.453" offset="14469204">Now on -- on the haste that my man was put on down on page 13 he testified, I was going to get down and go through to rush on where more or less rush to the end of the car where Pennington was and then we come to Mr. Whitehorn who is an assistant yard master and he describes his job, the climate of this job so vividly when he says on page 35 and that is it really -- it puts the conductor in the middle when he's got two new brakemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.388" offset="14596890">And I say that the Federal Employers Liability Act does not anticipate that a work request to accommodate a customer will put a yard conductor or a brakeman or anyone else in the middle.</text>

            <text syncTime="3637.899" offset="14654986">35 yes if Your Honor please the yardmaster's testifying to that there that it is two ways of looking at this thing, two ways of answering it in order to try to satisfy the Ford – at Ford Plant they do a little rushing and that he goes on his last remark he said, puts the conductor in the middle and that's just where this poor fellow wound up, in the middle because the dilemma here if the railroad attorney says, did you violate a safety rule he has lost his job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.176" offset="14776090">They bring him up before the disciplinary board so he never can say in open court I violated the safety rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.426" offset="14801063">He says that I -- I was doing what I could the best I could but it's impossible to do this job safely in 30 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.805" offset="14830634">Now if the Court pleases I don't want to leave without clarifying one thing about the practice of this claim agent sending people to this railroad doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.294" offset="14876505">On page 7 of the record, the head claim agent says, the question is, is it one of your duties to select the company physician and he almost let the cat out of the bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.903" offset="14914957">Now listen to this answer if Your Honors pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.244" offset="14924361">Answer - and he works -- he started to say, he works for me but he stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.631" offset="14941915">He works, he reports to the claim department to me yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.319" offset="14956648">And is it your duty to select him?</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.150" offset="14963963">Yes, and then for example do you give instructions to superior employees, have you given oral instructions to them that when a person is hurt to take them to Doctor (Inaudible)?</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.456" offset="15013177">No I don't do that directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.477" offset="15021328">It is just kind of a general understanding and it is a part of the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.207" offset="15044211">If Your Honor please, the control of that doctor who is not adhering to the typical client-patient relationship brings an advantage to the railroad and if Your Honor please for every advantage there's a disadvantage and the disadvantage here, if they're going to control the doctor they're going to be responsible for his improper actions thank you.</text>
