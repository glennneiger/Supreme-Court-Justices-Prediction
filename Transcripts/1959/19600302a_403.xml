            <text syncTime="26.117" offset="207809">We are here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in a case in which that court has sustained a District Court order enjoining peaceful picketing by my client, a labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.316" offset="268622">The picketing protested the loss of jobs to members of the Marine Cooks &amp; Stewards, the petitioner, and possible loss of more jobs in the future when a foreign vessel, the Nikolos, a vessel of Liberian registry, entered a trade previously occupied by an American vessel and resulting in the lay off of the American vessel and loss of jobs to the members of the petitioners' union.</text>

            <label>Mr. John Paul Jennings</label>
            <text syncTime="73.204" offset="396204">The trade between the West Coast of Mexico and Tacoma, Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.586" offset="421700">This trade had been occupied by American vessel, the Ira Nelson Morris and that ship was laid off, the Nikolos went into the trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.023" offset="463496">We also -- we maintain that the case, it's a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and therefore, the injunction was improperly granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.518" offset="517413">We also challenge the jurisdiction of the Court which was predicated on a theory which we think this Court rejected in Romero against International Terminal Operating Company in 1959, that is that a -- a federal question case under Section 1331 can be predicated upon a maritime tort, that was the theory of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.974" offset="615320">Now these are the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.149" offset="619917">The petitioner, Marine Cooks &amp; Stewards AFL, is one of a number of American unions representing seamen on the Pacific Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.410" offset="665057">The Marine Cooks &amp; Stewards represents the stewards department pursuant to a certification of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.117" offset="699852">And that it's a party to a collective bargaining contract establishing wages, hours, and conditions and welfare provisions and pension plans, and things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.381" offset="740916">Now shortly before this case arose in June of 1957, Willoughby, the agent of the Marine Cooks &amp; Stewards in the port of Seattle, Washington learned that the Nikolos was going to come in to the salt trade between the West Coast of Mexico and the Hooker Electro-Chemical plants in Tacoma, Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.393" offset="836942">Mr. Willoughby also learned that the Ira Nelson Morris, an American ship employing members of the petitioner, was laid off as a consequence of the entry of the Nikolos into the trade and that as a result, members of the various unions, including members of the petitioning union, were laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.038" offset="923564">Mr. Willoughby made inquiry of the Hooker Company in Tacoma to which the salt was consigned asking them whether they would permit him to put a picket line adjacent to the dock when the Nikolos came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.546" offset="993573">He told them that he indented to picket the ship when it arrived and that he was like to get the ship dock, he would also picket it at the dock and he wanted to picket inside because he wanted to avoid the charge of a secondary boycott and picketing the Hooker Plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.922" offset="1067029">When the Nikolos arrived on the early morning of June the 10th of 1957, Mr. Willoughby in a small cabin cruiser called the Willoughby began circling around the Nikolos.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.524" offset="1125439">The little cruiser which he was using to circle around had a sign on it which said “Picket Boat” and the sign was later changed to a different and larger sign which said “AFL-CIO seamen protest loss of their livelihood to foreign flagships with substandard wages or substandard conditions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="283.366" offset="1236825">Willoughby, during the course of his circling, was invited to board the Nikolos and he talked to the master of the ship and he told him that the Nikolos was interfering with the coastal trade and that that was why he was picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.661" offset="1302026">He also ascertained at that time that the wages on the Nikolos were about one-fifth, one-fifth of the wages on American ships under contract to the petitioning union.</text>

            <text syncTime="516.751" offset="2170337">The district judge believed that the picketing constituted unlawful interference with foreign commerce with a friendly foreign nation and that the Norris-LaGuardia Act did not forbid an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.585" offset="2225716">The Court, however, made the following fact findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.586" offset="2253720">In finding 16, which is on page 35 of the record, the Court said, “Plaintiffs or some of them have entered into and are seeking other contracts of affreightment covering the carriage of light cargoes from Mexican ports to United States ports in the Puget Sound area and to Hooker Electro-chemical dock in Tacoma aboard the S.S. Nikolos and or other similarly registered unmanned vessels owned, operated, or chartered by plaintiffs or some of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.031" offset="2375450">This is a finding that the plaintiffs intended to go into this business in a larger scale which naturally would result in more loss of jobs for the petitioner union and the court so found.</text>

            <text syncTime="1336.239" offset="5448286">It is also provided that a case shall be held to involve or grow out of a labor dispute, when it involves any conflicting or competing interest in a labor dispute of persons participating or interested therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.531" offset="5505546">And we say that this section of the Norris-LaGuardia Act also applies to our case, but for this additional reason, this is a labor dispute within the meaning of that Act because we have a direct interest in the -- what this -- foreign ship did to the jobs of the American seamen and Subsection (c) of Section 13 defines a labor dispute as including any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment regardless of whether or not the dispute can stand on approximate relation of employer and employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1700.868" offset="6906859">Now this Court as, Your Honors are aware has not given the Norris-LaGuardia Act a narrow or restrictive interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.955" offset="6939146">The narrow restrictive interpretation of the Clayton Act was removed by the Norris-LaGuardia Act in disputes of the characters that we have here where the picketing protests what the union considers to be unfair competition has been held to involve a labor dispute within the meaning of a Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.815" offset="7022634">The New Negro Alliance case and most closely in point, the Milk Wagon Drivers' Union case in which this Court considered the picketing by a union which picketed retail outlets of dairies which used the so-called vendor system of milk distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.499" offset="7109360">That is the dairies instead of employing their own employees to deliver the milk used independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.844" offset="7146768">And the union considered that the use of the independent contractors depressed wages and conditions and prevented union employees from getting jobs and restricted the opportunities, the job opportunities of union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.500" offset="7213328">This Court refers to the Court of Appeals which had held that no labor dispute existed there and reversed the order granting the injunction holding that reading the Norris-LaGuardia Act as Congress enacted it clearly this type of conduct constitutes a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.976" offset="7291277">So that what we have here is a case which we say falls within the express language of Norris-LaGuardia and we believe that the respondents must bear the burden of establishing that in some fashion, Norris-LaGuardia Act should not apply solely because a foreign ship was picketed and I think that this is the posture of the case here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2285.941" offset="9247117">For the example the Railway Labor Act and the National Labor Relations Act were interpreted to forbid discrimination and this Court enforcing that policy granted -- approved an injunction which enforced the mandate of those statutes.</text>
