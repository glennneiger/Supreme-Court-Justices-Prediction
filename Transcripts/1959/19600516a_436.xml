            <label>Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild</label>
            <text syncTime="22.298" offset="192554">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.842" offset="210735">This is an excise tax case which involves more than a question of revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.195" offset="240201">It involves questions, which, I think, touch on the integrity of the process of judicial review.In fact, one of the principal questions raised is what questions are before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.783" offset="302477">The taxpayers, whom I represent, recovered a refund judgment in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on excise tax assessed and paid on to our conditioning units.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.180" offset="376142">This was a test case.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.525" offset="389517">The Government appealed and obtained the reversal of the District Court on issues of law and fact which were not presented to the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.139" offset="439881">And we applied for certiorari and raised the questions that appear in our petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.984" offset="471333">There were five of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.426" offset="481050">And the Government responded to that petition saying that the Court of Appeals was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.330" offset="512711">Between the time of the filing of the Government's brief in opposition to certiorari and the filing of its brief on the merits, 12 days ago, the Government changed its position again and admitted error in the basic rationale of the Court of Appeals but, nevertheless, seeks to salvage the reversal of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.519" offset="609468">On no grounds, they were not presented either to the District Court or to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.327" offset="632665">And I think that the record shows an -- a trial de novo in the Court of Appeals in an attempt to obtain a new trial de novo in this Court after the certiorari papers were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.315" offset="700583">The facts are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.141" offset="715943">Taxpayers file suit in the District Court, as I stated, for the refund of excise tax paid on the sales of two air conditioners sold in 1954 and 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.970" offset="767248">And by stipulation with the Government, these refund suits were test suits to determine the applicability of the excise tax to more than 50,000 similar units on which excise taxes had been assessed but not paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.975" offset="851257">The statutes Section 3405 (c) of the 1939 Code and Section 4111 of the 1954 Code impose a -- this impose excise taxes on various types of household type equipment impose a 10% tax on the sale of self-contained air conditioning units.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.986" offset="959300">And until 12 days ago, when the Government's brief on the merits was filed, both parties agreed that this tax applied only to units of a household type.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.348" offset="1012799">Now, since 1948 and until really, until a few months ago and a new regulation was issued in response to the decision of the Court of Appeals, the Internal Revenue Service has consistently administered the tax under published revenue rulings which provide that the -- and I'm quoting from the ruling now, "type of self-contained air conditioning units subject to tax" is the unit of certain specified physical characteristics, window type and such, that has a total motor horsepower of less than 1 horsepower, and the parties have stipulated that consistently since 1948, this tax has had been administered so that the Commissioner has not know -- as it consistently exempted air conditioners with a motor horsepower of 1 horsepower or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.336" offset="1276740">Now, at the trial and incidentally, the only issue raised by the pleadings was the question of horsepower, that is whether the units of the taxpayer were 1 horsepower or less than 1 horsepower.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.955" offset="1335150">And there are only two standards for determining what horsepower is.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.033" offset="1355525">One is the actual horsepower that you can measure under standard operating conditions when the machine is in operation, and the other is the rated horsepower of the electric motor which drives the compressor which runs the air conditioning unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.785" offset="1430549">The rated horsepower means the rating standards published by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association have published standards for the guidance of their members in rating and putting horsepower ratings on the electric motors which drive the compressors and the air conditioners.</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="351.981" offset="1511320">By that, do you mean a label or some kind on the motor?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin A. Rothschild</label>
            <text syncTime="356.606" offset="1529814">Well, the -- the label is what I would call nominal horsepower reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.253" offset="1552384">In other words, each motor manufacturer who makes an electric motor assigns to it a nominal horsepower rating.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.631" offset="1589896">Now, he can, if he -- and he is more or less expected to follow the industrial standards, the NEMA rating standards but he doesn't have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.743" offset="1634304">And in this case, he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.657" offset="1646007">In other words, perhaps, I can explain it just by referring to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.680" offset="1674115">The issue at the trial of this case was whether, under the rating standards, the NEMA standards of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, the air conditioners in question should have had a 1 horsepower rating.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.328" offset="1744645">The District Court, and this was the only, incidentally, the only contested issue of fact in the case, the District Court held against the Government, held that they did have a 1 horsepower rating under the NEMA standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.164" offset="1800025">Nevertheless, the motor manufacturers who made the motors signed them a nominal rating of three quarter horsepower and the issue at the trial was that the -- had these motor manufacturers mislabeled their motors or had they done so correctly?</text>
            <text syncTime="442.633" offset="1873899">The Government's trial counsel, and I'd like to quote his own words because I think the issue at the trial is rather crucial in this case, had framed the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.180" offset="1924054">It said as follows, and I'm quoting from page 105 of the record, "We say that a 1 horsepower motor is used in the ruling means the motor that can be rated as a 1 horsepower motor.”</text>

            <text syncTime="470.367" offset="1984867">We have tried to prove today that these motors, under the NEMA standards, cannot be rated as 1 horsepower motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.786" offset="2022484">And on the next page of the record, we were talking about this nominal three quarter horsepower rating, Government counsel again said, “That is the rating that was put on them by the manufacturers of the electric motors in conformance with the NEMA standards.”</text>
            <text syncTime="496.687" offset="2090088">You can find that's on page 106 of the same record.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.758" offset="2106389">Now, the issues that were raised on appeal were simply eliminated from the trial by another stipulation that was made between trial counsel and myself, while I was trial counsel below, as I am here.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.727" offset="2190294">At the very beginning of the case which followed a pretrial conference when we did narrow the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.751" offset="2218402">Government trial counsels stipulated that the revenue rulings were entirely valid as the Government construed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.384" offset="2260929">And as I've already shown from quotations from the Government's counsel statements, the Government construed them as applying these NEMA ratings.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.856" offset="2306800">And this completely removed from the trial of the case a vast number of miscellaneous issues of evidence which, of course, were not needed to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.396" offset="2356955">The District Court, the only issue of fact left that was tried in the District Court was one and that was whether our air conditioners had a NEMA rating of 1 horsepower.</text>

            <text syncTime="2019.634" offset="8181948">I say may because I think there are alternative issues here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2027.687" offset="8214131">But I will present both issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.888" offset="8222908">First, what does the ruling mean when it says total motor horsepower of one or more exempts from tax or conversely that a total motor horsepower of less than one qualifies for tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.304" offset="8276616">What does total motor horsepower mean in terms of the various possible standards which maybe conceived of in measuring the horsepower of a motor used in an air conditioner?</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.114" offset="8327816">Now, there are several alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.958" offset="8335235">One alternative is engineering horsepower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.103" offset="8347773">You take the motor, you use predetermined test conditions, you make various measurements, and you compute horsepower mathematically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.455" offset="8381210">Another method is to look at a little metal plate which appears on the compressor itself which is what the air conditioner manufacturer receives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.824" offset="8418617">That metal plate has a designation horsepower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.943" offset="8431156">In this case, that metal plate reached three-quarter horsepower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.292" offset="8452577">So we're faced first with the question of which of these two possibilities is referred to in the ruling?</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.226" offset="8484237">Then we reach the second question, in our view, only if the construction of the ruling is resolved in favor of that set forth by the air conditioner manufacturer, that is if the ruling is construed to refer in terms of motor horsepower to the engineering horsepower, we have here admittedly air conditioning units whose motors exceed 1 horsepower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.894" offset="8590921">Therefore, under that interpretation of the rulings, they would be exempt from the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.897" offset="8610983">The next question which is presented is, if these rulings are to be construed in such a way as to exempt these units from the tax, are they valid under the statute or are they, as the Government contends, inconsistent with the statute and void because there is no rational connection between self-contained air conditioning units which is the only language in the statute and engineering horsepower?</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.141" offset="8711920">Now, those are the two issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="2162.008" offset="8751417">And we say that for a variety of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.554" offset="8761553">In the fist place, the tax is imposed upon the manufacturer of the air conditioning unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.271" offset="8784436">Now, the manufacturer buys a compressor from a compressor manufacturer and it uses it in the assembly of the finished unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.533" offset="8817455">The compressor which he receives has a little metal plate on it which designates the horsepower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.590" offset="8841697">Now, the compressor manufacturer didn't -- doesn't dream that horsepower up out of thin air.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.697" offset="8862177">He receives the horsepower from the motor manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.689" offset="8886105">The manufacturer of the motor determines the horsepower to designate for this motor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.271" offset="8908466">He informs the compressor manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.622" offset="8917870">The compressor manufacturer then puts a metal plate on his motor and calls it as, in this case, a three-quarter horsepower compressor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.771" offset="8954441">The air conditioning manufacturer receives the compressor and he then designates it as a three-quarter horsepower air conditioning unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.763" offset="8990386">He relies wholly upon the plate horsepower which he receives as counsel for the air conditioner manufacturer conceded below at page 105 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.453" offset="9045138">The compressor manufacturer takes the same rating and puts it on a plaque on the outside of the housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.429" offset="9069066">And if you are going to sell an air conditioner with that compressor in it, you can't very well sell it for something other than the rating the compressor manufacturer puts on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.077" offset="9107728">Now, we're taxing air conditioning manufacturers not motor manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.722" offset="9126222">The air conditioning manufacturer is not concerned with the motor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.095" offset="9139702">He's not concerned with the specifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.268" offset="9148479">He doesn't test the motor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.886" offset="9154957">He doesn't have access to the specifications under which the motor are tested from which you could compute the horsepower in an engineering set.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.302" offset="9188603">He's not concerned with that because he relies upon the compressor manufacturer who furnishes him a finished compressor which embodies the (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.393" offset="9220995">This compressor is adapted to the air conditioning requirements of the air conditioner manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.295" offset="9248580">So if we're looking for a test, which the Internal Revenue Service was here concerned with which would be ease of application which would permit certainty when the air conditioning manufacturer who, after all, self-assesses the excise tax, the simplest thing, which was apparent to the Commissioner at the time, was to tell the air conditioning manufacturer, “Well, look at the plaque on the compressor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.028" offset="9339486">And if it says it is less than one, collect the tax from your vendee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.349" offset="9360802">If it says it is an excess of one, you need not collect the tax from your vendee.”</text>
