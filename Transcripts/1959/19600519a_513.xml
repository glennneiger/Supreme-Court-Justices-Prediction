            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="30.611" offset="225782">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.781" offset="246471">This is a tax case, one which we believe to be of broad, economic and legal implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.835" offset="310732">In relation to this taxpayer, it raises the question whether a company which mines fire clay and shale to whether cheap and common minerals which characteristically sell at something around $2 or less a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.614" offset="405817">A company which mines those minerals and thereafter, manufactures them into sewer pipes, which sell at $35 or $40 a ton may take percentage depletion on the theory that its total receipts from the sale of sewer pipe represent its gross income from mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.874" offset="554820">Now, taxpayer's contention that it may do precisely that may strike the Court as rather startling, because though it has long been recognized that mineral depletion provides a very liberal allowance for mining, it is not generally been thought, at least until very recently, that percentage depletion affords a gigantic subsidy for manufacturing operations as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.172" offset="716048">Now, what we challenge here is not the concept of percentage depletion, but the attempt to incorporate into the base upon which percentage depletion is taken, values created by operations which are far removed from the concept of mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.191" offset="812178">Of the 12 principal processes used in making sewer pipe as explained, as outlined in taxpayers' complaint in this case, at Record 252, the first one of the 12 takes in the mining of the clay, the loading and the unloading of it and the delivery to the factory gates, and the other 11 are processes which are performed inside the Cannelton factory, and which involve, as the testimony of taxpayers, officer would show the use, among other things, of automatic presses and of extrusion machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.378" offset="1032861">In our view, this is a complete perversion of the depletion statute and of the implementing regulations, and we think it is in the teeth of some 40 years or more of history, the whole history of mineral depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.769" offset="1110497">In the course of which, I may say, no representative of the mining industry ever contended that the branch of the industry which he represented would be entitled to take depletion on finished products of the kind which taxpayer says may constitute the basis of depletion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.304" offset="1212583">First, let me state a little more of the facts before getting to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.545" offset="1241527">The tax years here are 1950 and in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.079" offset="1263679">In both those years, taxpayer, which is an Indiana corporation mined this fire clay and shale from pits which were very close to its factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.253" offset="1316342">It didn't sell this fire clay or shale, being an integrated operator it used it all in the manufacture of sewer pipe and certain related products.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.819" offset="1362631">Its cost in extracting mineral was something in the neighborhood of $2 per ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.625" offset="1393873">As I indicated, its sales price on the finished sewer pipe averages close to $40 a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.682" offset="1426056">Its complaint claims depletion on the express and explicit basis that its gross income from mining embraces the total receipts from its -- from the sale of its finished products.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.051" offset="1491571">The depletion rate, incidentally, on fire clay is 15% on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.451" offset="1525217">The depletion rate on shale is 5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.916" offset="1543084">And since it appears the taxpayer uses fire clay and shale, which come out of the same mining operation, incidentally.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.973" offset="1579238">In 60 to 40 proportions, it gets what I might call a mixed rate, which works out to 11%.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.243" offset="1620302">And this rate as applied to a depletion base computed by reference to the sales receipts from the sale of sewer pipe yield --</text>

            <text syncTime="403.397" offset="1716955">Now, this record shows that miners of fire clay in Indiana who are nonintegrated sold fire clay and shale for less than $2 a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.848" offset="1774738">It was sold in substantial quantities for prices ranging from $1.60 to $1.90.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.209" offset="1916217">Another way of putting it would be that the United States Treasury would be better off if Cannelton's theory of depletion is correct, to go out and buy fire clay and shale, and give it to Cannelton free of charge.[Laughter]</text>

            <text syncTime="471.757" offset="1990405">Because if depletion is a ticket to taking depletion -- if the statute is a ticket to taking depletion on the finished product, Cannelton is better off rejecting such an offer than it would be accepting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.642" offset="2081938">There was a miner across the river from the Cannelton Company who mined clay, the $1.40 a ton and sold it to a competing sewer pipe manufacture.</text>

            <text syncTime="514.054" offset="2159574">Cannelton's is over $2.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.558" offset="2169605">They have a deep mine and their costs are higher than most of these miners.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.587" offset="2193742">So they, more recently, buy it instead of mining it.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.669" offset="2210043">Well, “buy it” is the wrong word.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.343" offset="2220701">More recently, they're obtaining it from this same miner across the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.785" offset="2242539">They'd given him a dollar in return for which they have taken the lease, and they've given him a contract to mine the fire clay and shale.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.086" offset="2283708">They claim the economic interest on the basis of this lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.193" offset="2296142">And now, they take depletion on his fire clay and shale which he can mine and apparently, make a profit on delivering it at a $1.40 a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.612" offset="2329788">They're getting the depletion on that apparently today, yielding upwards of $4 a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.259" offset="2356433">The nonintegrated miners of fire clay, the Court of Appeals pointed out, would necessarily take depletion on the basis of the value of the raw clay and shale.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.693" offset="2402095">That would mean for someone selling fire clay at $2, he'd get 30 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.240" offset="2440338">If he sold shale, and shale was sold for $1 a ton, he would get 5 cents a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.517" offset="2469491">I won't labor the figures further.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.557" offset="2489553">I would like to point out that the Court of Appeals noted that the Government had proved that there were miners of fire clay and shale in Indiana who were nonintegrated and who were selling it.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.541" offset="2553501">It noted that out of 500,000 tons of fire clay sold in Indiana, in the tax year involved, taxpayer's own expert conceded that something like 300,000 tons had been sold by nonintegrated producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.425" offset="2637093">And the basis of the Court's holding that Cannelton, unlike miners of the same clients who are nonintegrated, may take depletion on the basis of finished product.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.422" offset="2693099">The basis of its holding was that Cannelton, because of its high mining cost and the high transportation cost, which it would have had in bringing raw clay and shale to the markets where it is sold in quantity, could not have sold it profitably.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.431" offset="2781080">Now we don't contest that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.709" offset="2794245">We agree that it could not have sold it profitably, its costs being what they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.120" offset="2819845">We don't think that that has -- that that is the test under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.332" offset="2840743">And that, of course, brings me without further delay to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.073" offset="2871672">The statute is set out in our brief on page 93, in relevant provision as -- I would like to identify the language for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.029" offset="2995493">I seem to lose my place at the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.204" offset="3008240">Oh, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.675" offset="3010121">It starts about four or five lines from the bottom on page 93.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.777" offset="3042513">Our question, of course, here is what is embraced in the concept of mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.396" offset="3064978">The statute first says that depletion may be taken on the basis of the gross income from the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.177" offset="3092041">It defines gross income from the property as gross income from mining, and then it goes on to say the term mining, as used herein, shall be considered to include not merely the extraction of the ores or minerals from the ground, but also the ordinary treatment processes normally applied by mine owners or operators in order to obtain the commercially marketable mineral product.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.575" offset="3221713">Now, that is the crucial language, though there is some further language to which I'll refer in a few minutes, which sheds further light.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.260" offset="3264449">Now, the Court of Appeals, here, concentrated on the words, “commercially marketable product” and it said, “Yes, raw fire clay and shale have commercial value and the Government's proof in this case has shown that there is a regular commerce in those minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.718" offset="3358281">Nonetheless, it goes on to hold that taxpayer did not have a commercially marketable product.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.468" offset="3393285">It individually, it did not have a commercially marketable product because the Court says it could not sell its fire clay and shale at a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.196" offset="3448142">As to the antecedent words, you will note that the statute speaks of a miner being unable to take depletion on the basis to include in depletion the ordinary treatment processes normally applied by mine owners and operators to obtain that product.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.523" offset="3533511">As to those antecedent words, ordinary treatment processes, the District Court made the finding, which you will find at Record 5, that the -- this is Finding 10, that the processes used by plaintiff, and I'll skip on, where processes normally applied by mine owners or operators who are engaged in the manufacture of vitrified clay sewer pipe and related products.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.223" offset="3672273">And the Court of Appeals apparently agreed with that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.933" offset="3691081">Now, the result here is that the court below has held, one, that the individual miner manufacturer, the miner who's integrated, can take his depletion on the basis of the product which he finds it profitable in his operation to make and sell, the finished product, if that's the first thing he finds it profitable to make and sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.574" offset="3801631">And it has held, second, that there's no objection to his including in the depletion base whatever processes, whatever their nature, are acquired in order to obtain that finished product.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.754" offset="3862340">Now, we differ on both those propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.933" offset="3887104">Now, Cannelton's main reliance, as I've said, is upon the words, “commercially marketable mineral product”.</text>

            <text syncTime="1589.618" offset="6461837">And if I may anticipate for a moment the discussion of the legislative history to which I intend to come later, Congress stated when it wrote the definition of mining with these four subparagraphs included.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.134" offset="6523904">It stated in the Senate Committee report that these subparagraphs were designed as a reasonable specification of various processes which might be included for various kinds and classes of mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.926" offset="6603107">I emphasize the reasonable specification because it is significant when we consider the types of processes which have been authorized and I emphasize further that the senate report referred to various, kinds and classes of mines, which does -- which we think is inconsistent with taxpayer's view that individual integrated miners can get widely varying depletion bases depending on the particular products which they make and sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.644" offset="6753991">The ordinary treatment processes listed by Congress are one in the case of coal, cleaning, breaking, sizing and loading for shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.464" offset="6797249">Now, all of these are obviously preparatory processes, getting it to the point where you're ready to load it on the -- on the coal cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.750" offset="6834343">The last of them is loading for shipment, and coal is almost invariably broken up and put through screens, broken and sized and cleaned before it's shipped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.530" offset="6889514">That's done right after mine or at the mine depot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.902" offset="6906964">The second category in the case of sulphur, pumping to that is cooling, breaking and again, loading for shipment, again, we're dealing with the necessary extractive or preparatory processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.401" offset="6976972">These are the -- the processes which are necessary to get sulphur out of the ground by the use of a method which sulphur miners all use the Frasch method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.705" offset="7026186">Indeed, you will notice as I go through these four subparagraphs that there are two categories of processes which are allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.145" offset="7059937">The one separative or extractive processes, getting the valuable constituent out of the mineral, eliminating the waste and extraneous matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.801" offset="7106539">The other preparatory processes to get it in shipping grade or form, breaking it up so it's in manageable size or eliminating excess moisture, crushing it if that's necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.894" offset="7166934">Well, going on that is the third subparagraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.423" offset="7177070">This relates not to one individual mineral but to a number of specified minerals, and then to a class, other minerals which are customarily sold in the form of a crude mineral product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.764" offset="7242480">And as to those, Congress has said that the miner, if he uses them, may take depletion on assorting, the concentrating, which is simply getting the mineral in more concentrated form and sintering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.977" offset="7311235">Sintering is heating up the dusty particles which you get from some minerals so they'll form a porous clinker because obviously, you can't ship dust, but you can ship clinkers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.253" offset="7360345">All -- again, one notes for the purpose of bringing the mineral to shipping grade and form and loading for shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.336" offset="7396707">Then we come to the fourth category.</text>

            <text syncTime="1866.503" offset="7569429">Well, there's great variation from mineral to mineral as to what you have to do to -- to get them ready.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.932" offset="7591058">As we know that in case of coal, they clean it, oddly enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.500" offset="7621360">The fourth category relates to minerals not customarily sold in the form of crude mineral product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.450" offset="7657200">There are various metals there and then it says, “And ore is not customarily sold in the form of the crude mineral product.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.605" offset="7685831">And as to those, the taxpayer to miner is allowed to include a variety of processes; crushing, grinding and beneficiation by concentration then various other methods of beneficiating the mineral and dropping down or by substantially equivalent processes or a combination of processes used in the separation or extraction of the product or products from the ore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.314" offset="7828668">So again, we have a group of processes which are separative or extractive which involve getting the valuable constituent out of the mine, but don't involve in any instance the kind of process which might be used for purposes of taking that valuable constituent and then making it into a new and different product, which is the kind of processes -- the kind of process which this taxpayer would include in its depletion base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.208" offset="7956250">Now, there's a parenthetical clause in subparagraph (4), which is important, and I'd skipped over and I now want to go back to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.927" offset="7995120">But not including -- not including as an ordinary treatment process, electrolytic deposition, roasting, thermal or electric smelting or refining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.369" offset="8044857">Now, this is highly significant, we think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.067" offset="8063666">And the reason is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.371" offset="8076831">When depletion was first granted, and I'm again anticipating the history for a moment, when depletion was first granted in relation to metals, and that took place in 1932, Congress was informed and informed at length that most of the metal miners were integrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.821" offset="8166693">In the case of iron ore, it was pointed out that more than 90% of the iron ore was owned or controlled by companies which were integrated, and that was about the same for copper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.580" offset="8225729">It was also pointed out, however, that there were small miners who were not integrated and who did not have their own smelting and refining works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.963" offset="8271182">What they did was simply to come get the mineral in fairly concentrated form and then sell what is called the ore concentrate to a so-called custom smelter who did the smelting and refining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.822" offset="8330637">And Congress was persuaded as early as 1932, though this -- this is of the 1943 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.870" offset="8362820">But Congress was persuaded as early as 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.654" offset="8377971">It indicated in its reports that the small miner who didn't have these works, the smelting and refining works, should get depletion on the same basis as the big ones and promptly after the 1932 Act, Treasury by Regulations, specifically for forbade the inclusion of smelting and refining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.989" offset="8471280">And then when Congress wrote this detailed definition, which we have in the 1943 statute, it too, following the prior regulations specifically for forbade smelting and refining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.829" offset="8526660">And this is particularly important, we think, because smelting and refining is obviously a great deal closer to normal mining operations than making sewer pipes or fancy ceramics in a -- in a factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.284" offset="8584547">Yet Congress excluded it because it was convinced that had it allowed smelting and refining, it would have caused a discrimination as between the small miner and the larger miner, and it decided that they should both have depletion on the same basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.546" offset="8669602">And I'd like to turn now to the legislative history which I've anticipated a little, but I'd like to go back and sketch the entire history of depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.534" offset="8737520">Obviously, it will be a very brief sketch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.780" offset="8754448">But I think it's important to get the idea of the development of this, in mind, because each of the statutes has dealt pretty much on the predecessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.828" offset="8810663">A mineral depletion actually began, though not percentage depletion, of course, with the first Income Tax Act in 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.749" offset="8846399">The Act of that year provided that there should be allowed as a deduction, a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion of property not to exceed in the case of mines, 5% of the gross value at the mine of the output for the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.476" offset="8929259">That point, though, has no provision for any kind of processing and it was cost to depletion and was the value at the mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.625" offset="8961860">The regulations which were promptly promulgated provided that if the market value of the product of the mine was established at some other place from the mine, then the gross value was to be reduced by the cost of the transportation, the reduction and the smelting charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.490" offset="9037302">And thus, at the very outset of the history, there is in the regulations an attempt to exclude specified activities which are not closely associated with the extractive process but might be performed by a company in which was integrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.018" offset="9115460">Of course, depletion by the discovery method was later authorized and under this method, we went from cost depletion to a depletion without reference to cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.595" offset="9185782">Under discovery depletion, the value of the mine at the time of discovery was estimated and then once its fair value had been fixed and the estimated amount of minerals in place had been determined, the miner was -- the miner established a per unit measure of depletion and he applied that measure to the number of units removed that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.628" offset="9313886">The next change after discovery depletion came in was in 1921 when Congress placed a filling on the annual deduction stating that it might not exceed in the case of any taxpayer his net income from the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.727" offset="9390268">And this limitation was later changed in 1924 to a so-called 50% net income limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.766" offset="9418480">He couldn't claim depletion in any year more than -- above 50% of his net income from the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.110" offset="9447842">Now once Congress imposed this net income limitation, which has persisted incidentally under percentage depletions, as well, it became immediately necessary, in order to apply that limitation, for taxpayers to distinguish between their gross income from mining or their net income from mining, as the case might be, and their income from other sources in the exact same way as necessary under the present statute to determine what its gross income from mining and what is gross income from some other activity such as sewer pipe making, which the miner may also happen to be engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.210" offset="9608234">Now in 1922, the Treasury Regulations provided, if the mineral products are not sold as raw material but are manufactured or converted into a refined product, then the gross income shall be assumed to be equivalent to the market or field price of the raw material before conversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.882" offset="9706872">In 1926, Congress went on and established depletion at that time only for oil and gas, and regulations promptly promulgated in 1927 provided in substance the same as the earlier regulations they held that the oil and gas producer who also transported or distributed or engaged in further activities would be held to the field, post-field price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.351" offset="9824737">He couldn't go beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.784" offset="9838529">Finally, in 1932, after numerous proposals had been made to it, Congress extended percentage depletion to coal, sulphur and to the metal mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.387" offset="9900910">And up until this point, depletion had been phrased simply in terms -- the depletion base had been phrased simply in terms of the gross income from the property, that is gross income from the mining property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2476.941" offset="10011146">Now, at these hearings, as I indicated earlier, emphasis was made upon the fact that the producers of many of these minerals were integrated, but there were small producers who were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.323" offset="10092648">For example, the representative of the American Smelting and Refining Company was one of the people who came before the Congress at these extensive hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.021" offset="10147506">And we've collected all of the legislative materials on which we're relying in the case in this larger volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.907" offset="10183032">And as he argued, he testified and I'm looking at page 102, immediately after the asterisks about a third of the way down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.413" offset="10260982">He testified that where the taxpayer's interests are varied as in the case of large mining companies, there is I believe, no doubt that as a rule, its books reflect the result of each operation, which make it possible for the taxpayer to determine to the satisfaction of the bureau the portion of the income applicable to mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.889" offset="10346977">And as his whole line of testimony shows -- I will not go into it further -- he insisted that it would be perfectly practicable in the case of the integrated producer to determine the basic mineral product and to put a value upon it so that the small man who didn't do his own smelting and refining but sold to concentrate would just take it on the same basis as the large operator who would also have to put a value on the mineral concentrate and not compute depletion after the smelting and refining had been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.037" offset="10491486">Now, promptly after the 1932 statute was enacted, Treasury promulgated regulations, after extensive conferences with the mining industry, and those regulations appear in this large appendix at 136.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.754" offset="10594408">And what Treasury did was to list in the regulations a number of processes which it would allow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.179" offset="10648116">And this listing and you'll note the four subparagraphs, is closely similar to the listing which later became in 1943, a part of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.515" offset="10713422">Congress made 13 additions and modifications of this in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.435" offset="10737142">But this listing was largely adopted and codified by Congress, and you'll note without my taking a time to go through these that these are again --</text>

            <text syncTime="2672.082" offset="10791685">This was the first set of regulations, Your Honor, following the extension of depletion to the metals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.678" offset="10818121">Prior to that, we only had regulations for oil and gas which didn't need any treatment as it came out of the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.256" offset="10852394">Now, as I have indicated, it was in 1943 that we first got the -- the elaborate definition in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.283" offset="10892518">The 1932 statute merely said that depletion would be of such certain percentage computed on the gross income from the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.377" offset="10924910">In 1943, we got the definition of mining in the statute, which I attempted to analyze at the outset of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.971" offset="10967228">Now, what were the circumstances that led Congress to write a fuller definition?</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.464" offset="11013204">Well, the mining industry had come to Congress in the early 1940s with two complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.860" offset="11054791">One, which Congress concluded was a valid complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.488" offset="11073285">And I'll concentrate on that one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.949" offset="11087182">The complaint was that the Treasury had been unduly restrictive in applying the 1932 regulations and particularly, that was alleged in the case of two types of miners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.838" offset="11178715">You'll note, reverting to page 136, where we set out this 1932 regulations that the fourth category of the Treasury Regulations allowed for concentrating and other processes to the extent to which they do not beneficiate the product in greater degree than crushing and concentrating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.266" offset="11296475">Well, the controversy was about the coverage of those words, “other processes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.555" offset="11325628">Two groups of miners came to Congress, primarily gold miners and quicksilver miners, and said that some miners of the -- of gold used processes other than the physical concentration process whereby you eliminate the waste specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.046" offset="11399607">Some used chemical methods of separating the waste in getting the gold out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.256" offset="11428446">And these miners said that Treasury had originally allowed this treatment process but that in 1940, it began disallowing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.129" offset="11463868">And the controversy between the miners and the Treasury was as to whether this chemical method called cyanidation of gold was or was not substantially equivalent to the physical concentration methods which other miners mining different types of deposits used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.282" offset="11544534">And the mining industry represented that these processes were substantially equivalent and that Treasury had been applying the regulation in this respect to narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.619" offset="11593853">Similarly, the miners, this quicksilver said that the Treasury had erroneously decided that it would not allow the furnacing of quicksilver, which is simply taking the -- the ore in which quicksilver is found and putting it into a simple retort and heating it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4050.180" offset="16304044">The question on the merits in this case is solely one of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.852" offset="16326823">There's no constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4059.326" offset="16340720">By call of presence of interpretation that has many facets, but the touchstone I think is to be found in the way the statute is actually written.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.054" offset="16387636">If the words which Congress used are carefully examined and then applied, the result to which they point may be tolerably clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.110" offset="16439777">Before going to the statute in detail, it's helpful, I think, to clear away some possible basis from misunderstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4094.379" offset="16480841">In the first place, although the statute is one which deals with depletion of minerals, the allowance made by Congress has nothing to do with the actual cost or the loss or expenditure sustained by the owner from the use of his materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.893" offset="16562970">One would expect that the depletion allowance would have something to do with depletion sustained, and that was true to a considerable extent in the very first income tax statute in 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.567" offset="16621589">But in 1918, only five years later, Congress had produced a new concept, discovery value, applicable to all minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.448" offset="16669132">At this point, cost ceased to be relevant and the aggregate allowance was based on the value of the property -- the value of the property, not the cost, within 30 days after discovery when you know what you've got, not when you're speculating.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.455" offset="16737155">In 1927, Congress went still further and introduced percentage depletion for oil and gas wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.957" offset="16775189">This was an outgrowth of the experience with discovery value, but it has one very important difference from discovery depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.859" offset="16818761">Under percentage depletion, the amount of the allowance not only has no relation to cost, but it is also entirely unlimited in amount, not even being limited to the amount of discovery value.</text>
            <text syncTime="4194.960" offset="16883231">It goes on at the rate of 27.5% in the case of oil and gas wells as long as oil and gas are produced, regardless of the taxpayer's cost, regardless of any other fixed amount, either cost or discovery value.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.073" offset="16959613">In 1932, Congress extended percentage depletion to sulphur and the metals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.221" offset="16992214">In later years, it extended percentage depletion to many other commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.896" offset="17014993">In 1951, it extended percentage depletion to clay and shale, the two commodities involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4236.448" offset="17049161">And finally, in 1954, it extended percentage depletion to all minerals, except in only soil and sod, and things taken out of the sea in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.811" offset="17106631">In this process, percentage depletion has become simply an allowance for the producers of minerals having nothing to do with their cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.198" offset="17160129">It's not measured or limited in any way by the amount invested by the taxpayer in the mineral deposit or by any other factor relating to the cost or value of the mineral deposit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.675" offset="17218121">It is simply an allowance for the producers of minerals, probably misnamed when it's called a depletion allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4289.269" offset="17260440">It is more accurately an incentive allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.805" offset="17278621">If it is thought out as to depletion, then there may be some tendency to try to restrict it narrowly so as to limit it to the amount invested by the taxpayer in the deposit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.084" offset="17323760">But Congress has not so restricted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.397" offset="17336926">Congress has indeed been very generous in the granting of depletion allowances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.824" offset="17358660">Congress loves percentage depletion, just as it loves farms and rivers and harbors, and many other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.874" offset="17390843">And Congress may well be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4325.186" offset="17404113">At any rate, it's Congress' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.440" offset="17417174">And if Congress chooses to provide a generous depletion allowance, there's no reason why its judgment should not be respected and carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4336.918" offset="17451029">If the allowance as written by Congress is indeed -- is indeed too generous, then the place where that should be rectified is in Congress and not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4347.803" offset="17494601">There's one more point of general background.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.023" offset="17511424">The taxpayer mines clay and shale from an underground mine in Cannelton, Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.222" offset="17540263">It is superior clay and shale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4362.753" offset="17554369">The record shows that it sold no clay or shale except for a negligible amount of ground fire clay and it also shows that there was no market for fire clay and shale in Cannelton.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.783" offset="17614555">The Government expressly concedes that the taxpayer could not profitably sell fire clay and shale in their raw form.</text>
            <text syncTime="4388.064" offset="17655620">Fire clay and shale were sold in Brazil, Indiana, 140 miles away, but all of this was produced by strip miners of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.206" offset="17712149">In most places, the clay and shale is a byproduct or a waste from the strip mining operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.389" offset="17744959">It's something that the coal miner has to get rid of.</text>
            <text syncTime="4412.765" offset="17754467">So, of course, he's glad to get rid of it cheap.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.308" offset="17768573">But our people had superior shale and clay, which the record shows “made the best sewer pipe in Indiana.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.031" offset="17803473">Now, with this background, we may turn to the statute as it was written by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4433.915" offset="17839000">It is set forth in the appendix to our principal brief on page 121.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.928" offset="17883094">In the first place, Congress generally allowed a reasonable allowance for depletion according to the peculiar conditions in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4456.048" offset="17927607">And then turning over to page 122, we find in the first paragraph of 114 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.829" offset="17970657">In the third line of the embedded material, we find shale, 5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.199" offset="17996152">And then in the third paragraph, we'll find refractory and fire clay, 15%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4483.631" offset="18037948">In this case, the taxpayer's mineral is 60% fire clay and 40% shale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.183" offset="18072116">And then Congress provides that the depletion allowance shall be those percentages, the fourth line from the bottom of page 122, of the gross income from the property, not somebody else's property, not some idealized property, not what it might have been that all miners together had been averaged out, but the gross income from the property during the taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4519.051" offset="18179532">There is, however, another limitation to which Mr. Spritzer has made no reference that such allowance shall not exceed 50 per centum of the net income of the taxpayer from the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.982" offset="18231254">And when Mr. Spritzer holds this $40 a ton sewer pipe up before you, he's made no reference whatever to the 50% limitation which sharply qualifies that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4544.516" offset="18281409">Incidentally, Mr. Justice Brennan, if you can produce brick for $3 a ton, I'm sure you can sell a large quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.151" offset="18312025">I understand that the price is about $15 a ton for -- for a brick.</text>

            <text syncTime="4602.547" offset="18513586">He has said that expressly here that in this case, there is nothing but the extraction of the ores and minerals from the ground, but Congress has said, “shall be considered to include not merely the extraction but also the ordinary treatment processes normally applied by mine owners or operators in order to obtain the commercially marketable mineral product or products.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.208" offset="18628211">The ordinary treatment processes normally applied by mine owners or operators in order to obtain the commercially marketable mineral product or products.</text>
            <text syncTime="4647.691" offset="18694144">Now, the figures referred by the Government to this Court show that 90% of the producers of fire clay using more than 73% of the total production of fire clay and 96% of the producers of shale using virtually all of the shale normally apply the same processes as this taxpayer did; grinding, tempering, shaping, firing to make either brick or tile or sewer pipe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4688.530" offset="18857462">And what 90% of the producers do to 96% of the material would seem to be what is normally applied by mine owners or operators in order to obtain the commercially marketable mineral product.</text>

            <text syncTime="4824.467" offset="19401226">-- so clumsy in finding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.406" offset="19408959">It's on pages 72 through 74, and these are materials from the Minerals Yearbook of the Bureau of Mines on which is, I say the Government was relying in its main brief in this case, but -- which it shied away from in its reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.765" offset="19506448">Now, these are the words of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.953" offset="19519195">“Mining shall be considered as not merely the extraction of the ores from the ground, but also the ordinary treatment processes normally applied by mine owners or operators in order to obtain the commercially marketable mineral product.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.468" offset="19597249">It seems to me that that makes it plain that Congress means to include in mining more than the extraction of the mineral from the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="4883.539" offset="19637478">The Government has been greatly troubled by these words and has long sought to exorcize them from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.170" offset="19668093">It's developed many theories in many different cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.618" offset="19685857">But before going into that, I would like to call attention to the language which Congress did once use nearly 50 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.356" offset="19724831">In the very first income tax, the one for 1913 which is set out on page 1 of the Government's large appendix, we find that there was a sort of percentage depletion in the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.881" offset="19790869">At that time though, the percentage was used to restrict the amount of the deduction below cost, not to expand it above cost as in the present statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.994" offset="19831306">But what Congress said in 1913 was that depletion should not exceed 5 per centum of the gross value at the mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4944.263" offset="19880417">Now, let's look at that phrase, “gross value at the mine.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.627" offset="19901837">This is essentially what the Government argues for in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4954.370" offset="19920854">Yet, it is obvious that the statutory provision here is very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4959.589" offset="19941752">What the Government's position amounts to either, is either an elimination of the words, which Congress has written specifically with respect to the commercially marketable mineral product or products or at the very least, a substitution for these words of other words which have a much more restrictive meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4981.156" offset="20027956">In various cases at various times, the Government has come up with different formulae which it liked to have read into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.526" offset="20065468">In some of the earlier cases, it sought to draw a distinction between manufacturing and mining, and it has finally in its reply brief in this case come back to launch that same argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5002.508" offset="20113429">This was done in the Cherokee Brick case in the Fifth Circuit, in the Merry Brothers case where this Court denied the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.443" offset="20157106">Then in the Dragon Cement case in the First Circuit, the Government sought to lay stress on the words “mineral product” and sought to confine them to the product as it comes out of the mine or very shortly thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5028.775" offset="20218441">That argument was rejected in an opinion by Judge Magruder for the First Circuit and since this gives a careful discussion of the problem and for the convenience of the Court, we have printed it in full in Appendix 2 to our brief which is the -- the white supplement, somewhat smaller than the Government's but the total volume of words in this case is already considerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5061.096" offset="20347800">Then in the Richland shale case and in the Court below in this case, note I said the Court below, the Government's argument was based on the concept of least processed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5074.581" offset="20401716">Of course there's nothing like this in the statute as Congress has written it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5078.791" offset="20418539">Congress didn't say least processed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.754" offset="20430346">It said commercially marketable mineral product or products.Congress might have said many other things, but it's what Congress did say that ought to be controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.303" offset="20484577">When the Treasury went to Congress last year to try to get the law changed, it developed still a different phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.946" offset="20511117">And this appears at page 131 of our Appendix 2 where there is set forth the text of the statute, which the Treasury submitted to Congress last year to deal with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.268" offset="20572453">And the idea is there expressed as “capable of being transported,” as distinguished from those processes “which make the mineral or ore saleable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.212" offset="20632221">This would be getting completely away from the words, commercially marketable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.126" offset="20651865">Commercially marketable surely means saleable and no formula can be a sound construction of this statute which does not give effect to that construction and yet I suggest that what the Government is arguing here is in essence what they sought to get, unsuccessfully sought to get Congress to put into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.788" offset="20734516">Finally in its main brief in this case, in this Court for the first time, the Government came up with still another formulation and its effort to escape from the effect of the commercially marketable mineral product or products, words.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.200" offset="20804211">In its main brief in this Court, the Government repeatedly based its argument on a new phrase “fit for commercial or industrial use”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.560" offset="20857605">That is no doubt an interesting conception, but it is not the test enacted by Congress and there's no reason why the words of Congress did use should not be given the statute's.</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.291" offset="20916537">Apparently, the Government now agrees, for in its reply brief, it has abandoned that phrase entirely and now comes up with still another set of phrases, all of course, in an effort to get away from the words which Congress used.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.710" offset="20990203">Now, there's another part of the Government's case as to which I'm a little baffled.</text>

            <text syncTime="5299.144" offset="21299911">Now it's true this taxpayer is much closer, but economically, it is just as far away as if the sales were in Maine or California.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.767" offset="21338467">If this taxpayer's costs are $2.41 a ton to get its superior clay out of an underground mine, its cost to transportation from Cannelton to Brazil, the record shows, varies from $5 to $6 a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="5324.375" offset="21400848">And the price for strip mining waste in -- in Brazil is a $1 to $1.5 a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.561" offset="21429582">Now, Brazil might just as well be in Maine or in California as far as this taxpayer is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.274" offset="21460511">It is an irrelevant market with respect to this taxpayer, the finding of the District Court, unchallenged is, that there was no market for the taxpayer's fire clay and shale.</text>
            <text syncTime="5354.356" offset="21520802">There is no -- there was never any issue in the District Court with respect to salability generally throughout the United States of fire clay and shale, and the record is very sparse on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5367.474" offset="21573256">The Government finally in this Court for the first time referred to this Bureau of Mines pamphlet that I have mentioned, but which is not in the record and was never called to the attention of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.554" offset="21625605">The sole contest in the District Court in this case was with respect to whether the taxpayer could sell its fire clay and shale.</text>
            <text syncTime="5390.157" offset="21663953">And incidentally, there is much reason to -- to think that the whole case is a kind of a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="5398.739" offset="21698330">In the opening of the taxpayer's counsel in the District Court, page 17 of the record, and I'd like to have the Court look at this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5408.119" offset="21735842">Right at the middle of the page, Mr. (Inaudible), counsel for the Government in the District Court said, “The economics of the situation will also be a matter of proof, and the Government will offer evidence to show the average cost including a profit of transporting clay is 1.80 cents per ton-mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="5435.000" offset="21843362">And this was in an effort to show that the taxpayer couldn't get its clay to Brazil and sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5442.638" offset="21873873">And then they produced their witness, Mr. Smith, and his testimony appears on page -- begins on page 84 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5451.436" offset="21909086">And if you will look at the very bottom of the page, you will find that Mr. Smith testified that it cost 1.80 cents a ton-mile to haul the clay.</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.760" offset="21954435">And that's the bottom of page 84.And then Mr. Smith was cross-examined and he clung to the 1.80 cents a ton-mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.980" offset="22003336">He weakened a little, but he never would give up even when it was pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5480.848" offset="22026742">And then the next day, page 161 of the record, Mr. Smith came back to Court and Mr. (Inaudible), counsel for the Government stood up in Court interrupting another witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.195" offset="22092152">“Your Honor, may I interrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.513" offset="22097377">Mr. Smith who testified yesterday -- this is page 161 near the bottom of the page -- has examined the computations which he made and states to me that he made a misplacement of the decimal point, and it should be 18 cents per ton-mile rather than one and eight tenths on the short-haul distances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5517.310" offset="22172609">The Court, “Now, do you want to call him as witness?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.613" offset="22185775">Mr. Travis, for the plaintiff, “We will stipulate the 18 cents is correct, the correct figure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5525.803" offset="22206568">Mr. (Inaudible), for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5527.849" offset="22214719">Mr. Smith came back to make the record clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5531.950" offset="22231124">And thus, the Government's proof with respect to the possibility of getting the taxpayer's clay to Brazil evaporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.639" offset="22285876">Now, I come to this point which baffles me.</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.961" offset="22303222">Until this afternoon, the Government has expressly conceded that the clay and shale involved here were not covered by those four Roman numbered paragraphs to which Mr. Spritzer referred in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5572.457" offset="22393187">I'd like to call attention to the Government's brief, the top of page 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="5579.673" offset="22422026">The minerals involved in this case, fire clay and shale are not specifically designated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5592.777" offset="22474480">Now, on the basis of that concession, Mr. Spritzer said the opposite this afternoon but in his brief he says they are not specifically designated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5603.489" offset="22517321">On that concession, this is in the language of the statute, an agreement that shale and clay are not customarily sold in the form of a crude mineral product, and I can only surmise that the Government has seen the consequences of its concession that shale and clay are not covered by the statute by the specifically numbered places.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.500" offset="22633409">They have never before in any court, in this case, made a suggestion that those four numbered paragraphs specifically applied to this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="6451.011" offset="25907388">This may be the case which demonstrates the truth of the old quip that when the legislative history is ambiguous, we should look to the language of the statute, where there are large amounts of legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="6468.485" offset="25977292">Both parties who worked hard to put it before the Court, the Government's appendix has 466 pages running from 1913 to 1954 and we're all much indebted to them for putting that together.</text>
            <text syncTime="6482.559" offset="26033612">I -- my only objection to it is the way they used italics, and I hope the Court will read all that's there, not just what they have italicized.</text>
            <text syncTime="6491.071" offset="26067675">In the appendix to our brief, in order to complete the picture, we've added 57 pages more running from 1930 to 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="6499.915" offset="26102993">We've also filed with the Court copies of the hearings held on this subject by the Ways and Means Committee in 1959 when the Treasury presented to Congress essentially the same arguments which the Government counsel is presenting here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="6516.587" offset="26169762">Indeed, the table attached to the Government's petition for certiorari showing in greatly exaggerated form, I believe, the amount the Government says is involved in this general problem is precisely the same as the table which the Treasury represented to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6536.328" offset="26248652">It's too bad to have to look at all these legislative history, when as it seems to me that the question is reasonably clear, that words of the statute are allowed to have their natural meaning and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6548.671" offset="26298075">But if one does look to the legislative history, it's our view that it supports the conclusion for which we contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="6557.226" offset="26332244">Before percentage depletion was extended to metals and to sulphur in 1932, there were extensive investigations and reports, reports which lie at the very foundation of the legislative history, the Parker Report and the Shepherd Report included in large part in the Government's appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="6577.713" offset="26414268">These reports pointed out to Congress the difficulties arising out of discovery value.</text>
            <text syncTime="6584.315" offset="26440600">Essentially, the problem evaluation, no two experts could agree on the discovery value of any mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6593.702" offset="26478216">No taxpayer could make out his tax return and no taxpayer could ascertain his tax liability without litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6602.918" offset="26514996">The crying need was for certain and this, I believe, is the key to all that Congress has done in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6611.528" offset="26549478">Congress has tried to provide a method for determining depletion which would be automatic, which the taxpayer could follow and apply himself and which he could use in making out his own tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="6626.031" offset="26607470">Our whole system of income taxation depends upon self-assessment and the key to percentage depletion, I think, is that Congress has at all times undertaken to set up a system which would be susceptible to self-assessment and is constantly amended and modified the statute to offset efforts by the Treasury to cut down percentage depletion in ways which would make self-assessment difficult or impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6654.526" offset="26721468">In the Tax magazine a year ago, there was a cartoon which illustrates the point I have in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="6660.533" offset="26745501">The picture showed a meeting of the Ways and Means Committee in the session and a congressman standing who says, "Before I vote, I want to call my taxman and find out if he could prepare my tax return under this proposed amendment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6678.584" offset="26817703">In the present case, the taxpayer can readily prepare his tax return if the taxpayer's position is sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="6686.517" offset="26849468">On the other hand, if the Government prevails, there will be no ascertainable figure which the taxpayer can use to determine the amount of his depletion deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6695.735" offset="26886353">That will depend on a theoretical or hypothetical figure representing no operation of the taxpayer, not appearing on the taxpayer's books, not ascertainable by the taxpayer by any means to which the Government has yet pointed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6712.444" offset="26953122">Prior to 1932, Congress was told several ways in which percentage depletion might be ascertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="6720.486" offset="26985305">One was the fixed rate per unit method, so much per pound or per ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="6726.318" offset="27008606">And you could apply that here and you could tell the answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6729.626" offset="27021876">Congress didn't adopt this for the very reason that it would not recognize differences among taxpayers and the value of various grades of ores.</text>
            <text syncTime="6740.028" offset="27063463">Congress was told that percentage depletion could be based on gross income or on net income and Congress in fact adopted both of these measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="6752.293" offset="27112573">Basically, percentage depletion is based on gross income from the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="6757.739" offset="27134307">But it is limited to 50% of the net income of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="6762.584" offset="27153742">But the important thing to note is that in each case, the percentage is applied to an ascertainable figure derived from the taxpayer's own operations and experience, not by going out and surveying the country as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="6778.372" offset="27216854">The Treasury soon put out some rather restrictive regulations but interestingly enough, we now know that from the beginning, the Treasury agreed that it would not apply these regulations and this is an -- an interesting event which is set out on page 85 of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="7049.014" offset="28299473">I don't believe so Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="7061.084" offset="28347747">Since 1943, Congress has continued to extend percentage depletion to additional minerals always following the commercially marketable products rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="7072.868" offset="28394872">For example, when the Treasury sought to eliminate transportation from the mine to mill, the Treasury says, “Well, transportation isn't mining.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7080.482" offset="28425279">It's transportation, and they'd cut it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="7084.279" offset="28440534">Congress specifically provided that transportation should be included in order to maintain the commercially marketable products rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="7093.450" offset="28477210">In 1951, Congress extended percentage depletion to fire clay and shale along with many other products.</text>
            <text syncTime="7100.628" offset="28505840">Again, the legislative history along with the statutory language shows that the commercially marketable product rule was intended, something readily ascertainable and capable of self-assessment by the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="7116.343" offset="28568743">It should be noted that the Government's position here amount as Mr. Spritzer conceded in saying that in the case of fire clay and shale as mined by this taxpayer, there are no ordinary treatment processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="7129.826" offset="28622660">Thus, rendering nugatory a clear and carefully worked out provision of the statute which Congress has maintained now for 17 years and which because it was made retroactive in 1932, when it was is first enacted, has been applicable to percentage depletion for 28 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="7147.859" offset="28694758">What is the basis for writing these words out of the statute, which is the general effect of the Government's position?</text>
            <text syncTime="7154.580" offset="28721716">Congress can, of course, do that if it chooses, but has shown no signs of wanting to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="7162.708" offset="28754213">It should also be pointed out that the Government's position here would mean that no underground miner of shale or fire clay, no underground miner of shale or fire clay, any place in the country, would ever get any percentage depletion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="7183.004" offset="28835401">This is because of the limitation of the allowance to 50% of the net income from mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="7188.845" offset="28858702">If the underground miner's operations often is here yielding a superior grade of clay and shale are to be limited by sales, far away in an unattainable market, made by strip miners of coal who obtain clay and shale as a waste or byproduct, then the underground miner will have no net income from his property and thus, no percentage depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="7213.786" offset="28958490">It seems obvious that this was not the result intended by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="7230.003" offset="29023378">I feel there is the large element of incentive here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7232.782" offset="29034454">Congress -- they didn't test this Congress to -- for a hundred years, Congress has done things for miners in great and generous ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="7243.005" offset="29075414">And I think that here, it is plainly intended as an incentive for miners.</text>
            <text syncTime="7249.102" offset="29099760">This leads to the next point I wanted to make, which is that percentage depletion is determined not only by the base, but also by the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7258.668" offset="29138004">In the case of clay, the rate is -- in the case of -- of shale, the rate is lower, 5% as compared with 27.5% for oil and gas and 23% for sulphur and 15% for metals.</text>
            <text syncTime="7273.812" offset="29198608">It's also 15% for fire clay but that's a fairly rare commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="7279.463" offset="29221177">If the result of this based on rate is too much then the easy way to change that is to change the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7287.387" offset="29252942">But the rate is surely a matter for the judgment of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="7291.239" offset="29268302">Of course, this Court would not say that when Congress said the depletion allowance should be 15% or 5%, it really meant that this rate should be 8% and 3%, no more should the Court fail to give effect to the commercially marketable mineral product or products test which Congress has persistently and consistently maintained in this important area of which it has been fully and constantly aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="7318.489" offset="29377285">Incidentally, nobody knows where these percentages came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="7322.877" offset="29394840">There was apparently some slight basis for the original 27.5% for oil and gas though the exact figure was a compromised -- committee-compromised between 25% recommended by the Senate Finance Committee and 30% adopted on the floor of the Senate and the Conference Committee split the difference and made it 27.5% and we've had that now for 34 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="7351.074" offset="29507688">The 15% for metal mines introduced in 1932 was apparently based on a survey showing that discovery value depletion had averaged about 17% of gross sales, now note that, the -- the Parker and Shepherd Report to which the Government refers, based the 15% on the fact that discovery value taking the taxpayer's return, they found their sales, whatever they sold, whether it was concentrate or refined metal, they found that that came out to about 17%.</text>
            <text syncTime="7384.710" offset="29642167">So they said, “Well, let's make it 15% of gross sales.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7389.231" offset="29660348">But beyond this, there's no basis for the percentages beyond legislative judgment or choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="7394.197" offset="29680201">Fire clay is 15%, perhaps because it's probably scarce.</text>
            <text syncTime="7398.320" offset="29696606">Shale is 5%, not inconceivably because Congress recognized that it is applied to a fairly large base under the commercially marketable mineral product or products rule which Congress has long maintained in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="7413.262" offset="29756374">Coal is 5% to begin with, but in 1951, Congress raised it to 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="7420.241" offset="29784377">The whole matter is neither precise nor scientific.</text>
            <text syncTime="7423.973" offset="29799215">It should not be approached, I think, in a niggardly or parsimonious way.</text>
            <text syncTime="7429.442" offset="29821158">Congress may well know just what it is doing in this area as the legislative history, I think, shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="7437.229" offset="29852296">The President of the American Institute of certified public accountants in a recent address said, “What are called loopholes are often Congress' way of apologizing for the high tax rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="7450.992" offset="29907362">These are special provisions to afford some taxpayer's relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="7455.955" offset="29927215">For example, the average taxpayer gets sick pay tax-free.</text>
            <text syncTime="7460.808" offset="29946650">Married people are taxed more lightly to split income.</text>
            <text syncTime="7465.253" offset="29964413">The executives get to break through stock options and investors have the cushion of capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="7471.381" offset="29988864">And in fact, Congress sets higher rates and then tears them down -- tears down some of the rate structure by allowing special benefits for some taxpayers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7484.199" offset="30040168">That's the end of the quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7485.379" offset="30044871">The economic effects from such an allowance as percentage depletion are far from clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="7490.836" offset="30066709">It's perhaps easy to assume that what is involved here is some sort of bonanza for taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="7496.627" offset="30089906">But an actual operation, percentage depletion may mean such things as lower prices for consumers, more employment and higher wages for the workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="7506.651" offset="30129925">It may mean that this business is kept operating and paying taxes or that the use for national resources effectively utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="7514.436" offset="30161168">All of these things may be the consequences of percentage depletion and Congress may well have had such consequences in mind in extending percentage depletion to mineral resources as widely as it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="7527.276" offset="30212472">The Treasury's argument goes far to read percentage depletion out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="7532.085" offset="30231698">This is shown when the Government says in its reply brief that cost depletion is available, what cost depletion to the mill here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7540.271" offset="30264508">But Congress granted percentage depletion to fire clay and shale, and it is hardly consistent with the legislative purpose to adopt the construction of its word which would eliminate percentage depletion for a large segment of the clay and shale industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="7556.243" offset="30328351">Besides, this eliminates the whole discovery value concept which for more than 40 years has been the background of percentage depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="7570.398" offset="30384985">The approach of Congress is illustrated by the events of the past seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="7576.792" offset="30410585">Three times, beginning in 1954, the Treasury has tried to get Congress to change the commercially marketable mineral product or products rule and Congress has never done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="7591.021" offset="30467427">In 1954, the Treasury sought to get Congress to eliminate molding, shaping, extruding, firing or burning in the case of the brick and tile clay.</text>
            <text syncTime="7605.012" offset="30523434">Well, obviously, those are the same processes that are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7608.744" offset="30538376">At first, the Ways and Means Committee announced that it was going to make this change, but six days later, on February 24, 1954 did announce that it had reconsidered leaving the question as it was under existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7625.277" offset="30604518">The new Internal Revenue Code of 1954 was enacted in the same language as the 1939 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="7632.071" offset="30631685">Congress has never made this change.</text>
            <text syncTime="7636.860" offset="30650807">In 1958, they brought our figures on.</text>
            <text syncTime="7640.791" offset="30666585">The Secretary of the Treasury formally asked Congress to abolish the commercially marketable products rule as to clay and as to minerals used in making cement.</text>
            <text syncTime="7650.885" offset="30706918">Later, the Treasury submitted a specific legislation showing in its submission, however, that it understood that law to be in accordance with our position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7660.790" offset="30746520">Once again, Congress took no action, no hearings were held, no bill was introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="7669.929" offset="30783091">Finally, in 1959, the President included this question in his budget message.</text>
            <text syncTime="7676.676" offset="30810049">The Secretary of the Treasury wrote to the Speaker of the House and to the Vice-President, recommending the elimination of “raise the commercially marketable mineral product or products from the statute” and the substitution of a new definition of mining.</text>

            <text syncTime="9060.070" offset="36343620">And the marketable mineral product that Congress is talking about is the valuable constituent of the mine and it proposed to treat each class of mine in accordance with what that class of mine was after, what it was engaged in getting out of the deposit and to allow depletion on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="9080.315" offset="36424600">I suggest that it is baseless to the tribute to the Government, a purpose of wiping out all ordinary treatment processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="9092.598" offset="36473814">The chart which appears at the back of our appendix shows the processes which different miners use.</text>
            <text syncTime="9099.504" offset="36501400">As it happens, we have here a clay which comes unmixed with dirt and is salable and is sold as you dig it out of the ground, but the miner of metal has to use the various concentration processes to get his mineral concentrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="9119.440" offset="36581125">Now, the consistent purpose of Congress to avoid discrimination as between members of the same class, miners of the same kind is evident throughout this whole history and this is indeed not the view of the Government alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="9145.483" offset="36685302">We have here a brief from the National Coal Association, as -- as amicus in this case to which I hope to refer if I can locate it among all of my papers.</text>

            <text syncTime="9230.818" offset="37026670">The American Mining Congress, at those hearings, acknowledged and quoted the statement in our reply brief from the Chairman of their Tax Committee that recent cases had gone far beyond the original concept of depletion, so this view of the statute isn't ours alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="9247.214" offset="37092185">We didn't get legislation but Dean Griswold has neglected to mention the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="9252.011" offset="37111411">After the hearings were concluded, the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee told the Congress that though the hearings had been held, the Committee did not intend to take any further action because the matter of the interpretation of the statute, as it stood, was before this Court in this case.</text>
