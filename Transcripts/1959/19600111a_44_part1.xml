            <text syncTime="19.120" offset="179806">There are two questions in this case, one of limitations, the other of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.359" offset="208854">The limitations question can be put in a nutshell.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.029" offset="227453">Section 10 (b) of the National Labor Relations Act provides in part that no complaint shall issue based upon any unfair labor practice occurring more than six months prior to the filing of the charge with the Board and the service of a copy thereof upon the person against whom such charge is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.021" offset="323480">An employer and a union enter into a collective bargaining agreement, by which, the Union is recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative and which contains a conventional union shop agreement or provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.081" offset="387741">The agreement is, in all respects, valid on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.223" offset="404250">However, at the time it was entered into, the Union did not represent a majority of the employees within the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.326" offset="444688">More than six months later, an unfair labor practice charge is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.979" offset="467257">Based upon that charge, a complaint issues and the Board finds that within the six-month period, the company and the Union continued the agreement in effect and executed and continued a second agreement in effect, and these acts within the six-month period constitute unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.833" offset="558686">The sole foundation for the conclusion that the acts within the period constitute unfair labor practices are the unfair labor practice of entering into the agreement when the Union had no majority which occurred more than six months before the charge was filed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard Dunau</label>
            <text syncTime="254.621" offset="1121886">And so, our question is whether the six-month period of limitations precludes reliance upon a barred unfair labor practice as the foundation for finding their conduct within the six-month period is an unfair labor practice.</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="270.236" stopTime="280.425">

            <text syncTime="270.236" offset="1184266">Is it your position then, that the limitation is one of extinguishment or one of limitations?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_dunau" startTime="280.425" stopTime="448.333">
            <label>Mr. Bernard Dunau</label>
            <text syncTime="280.425" offset="1225122">Our position is that once the six-month period has gone upon an unfair labor practice, liability for that unfair labor practice is extinguished and that you cannot taint later conduct in reliance upon an act which has been barred by limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.050" offset="1299623">Now, what happened here?</text>
            <text syncTime="300.800" offset="1306624">In July of 1954, the company requested -- the Union requested the company to recognize it as the bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.619" offset="1341837">After discussions amongst the company officials, the company decided to extend recognition to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.282" offset="1368482">And so, on August 10, 1954, a collective bargaining agreement was entered into between the company and the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.349" offset="1404740">The agreement contained a conventional recognition clause by which the Union was accredited as the bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.558" offset="1433579">It contained a conventional union shop clause by which employees were required to join the Union within 45 days of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.377" offset="1468897">It contained a conventional check-off clause by which the employer was authorized upon the individual authorization of each employee to check-off union dues and fees and to remit them to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.833" offset="1526680">The agreement was, in all respects, conventional.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.291" offset="1536502">It contained the management functions clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.497" offset="1545383">It provided for hours in overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.120" offset="1555832">It had a grievance procedure culminating an arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.391" offset="1568893">It provided for a five-cent per hour wage increase immediately and it deferred increase of five cents within four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.852" offset="1594807">However, the Board found that on August 10, 1954, when this agreement was entered into, when recognition was extended to the Union, the Union did not represent a majority of the 148 employees who were employed at the Reading plant of the company which was the unit covered by this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.624" offset="1681847">About a year later, a second agreement was entered into between the company and the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.591" offset="1705775">The original plant, the Reading plant, it had been planned, would operate with about 150 to 200 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.060" offset="1735659">The company expanded its operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.055" offset="1743600">It had about 350 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.624" offset="1753840">It acquired a second plant about 12 miles away and a new agreement was entered into which enlarged the unit to cover both plants, the original Reading plant and the second Hillsdale plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.151" offset="1800025">There is no issue in this case about the propriety of this expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.270" offset="1816430">That is conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.502" offset="1821341">The unit properly covers both plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.063" offset="1835656">The agreement was altered in order to provide for seniority in the two plants as a single seniority area for the purposes of those employees who had in -- been employed at the Reading plant and would have been transferred to the Hillsdale plant to man that plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1791.565" offset="7269648">Now, this was a dominating purpose of Congress in this situation because the six-month period itself, by its very shortness, indicates that the dominating purpose of Congress was to bring surcease to these controversies to quiet them if they weren't made the subject of a charge within six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.704" offset="7350209">Well, you can never quiet a controversy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2024.933" offset="8203055">Now, the rider to the current appropriations bill which the Senate -- to which the Senate Report referred said this in part, “No part of the funds appropriated in this title shall be used in any way in connection with a complaint case arising over an agreement or a renewal thereof between management and labor which has been in existence for three months or longer without a complaint being filed by an employee.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.656" offset="8326040">So that the Senate Report referred to the appropriations bill wrier which explicitly said, “If three months go by without a charge filed, you cannot prosecute a complaint over that agreement.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2071.897" offset="8390928">This limitations rider or one substantially like it had been in each Board appropriation act since 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.143" offset="8427917">So that for four years preceding the -- the adoption of a general statute of limitations in 1947, the riders to the Board's Appropriations Act had barred the Board from using funds to prosecute a complaint over an agreement if o charge had been filed within three months of the agreement and other conditions of the riders were met.</text>

            <text syncTime="2636.237" offset="10648325">And once the Congress enacted the general six-month period of limitations, it discontinued the appropriations riders -- the riders in the Board's Appropriations Act and this was consistent with the report -- the explanation in the Senate Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.351" offset="10704750">When we had a six-month period of limitations, the riders would no longer be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.029" offset="10723453">Well, under the Board's interpretation, the riders continued to be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.016" offset="10739440">Now, how does the Board get there?</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.138" offset="10747904">It gets there, first, by saying Section 10 (b) is not a rule of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.383" offset="10776952">It is a statute of limitations, and we agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.415" offset="10789073">It also says Section 10 (b) does not preclude receipt in evidence of events which transpired before the six-month period, and we agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.995" offset="10827316">It then says, because we can receive in evidence events which occurred more than six months before, we are, therefore, free to adjudicate this conduct within the six-month period exclusively upon the basis of the barred unfair labor practice, and that's where we part company because the receipt in evidence of events which occurred more than six months before has always been subject to the important limitation that you can receive such evidence for background purposes only but you cannot give that evidence independent and controlling significance to find that unfair labor practice within the six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.568" offset="10981648">Well, here, obviously, the initial unfair labor practice was not received as background evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.570" offset="11005680">It doesn't even give it sufficient scope to say it was received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.277" offset="11032430">It was given independent and controlling significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.762" offset="11042461">It was given exclusive significance but, for that unfair labor practice, there's nothing within the six-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.338" offset="11068688">And so, upon the basis of what the Board and the Courts of Appeals have themselves said with respect to receipt in evidence or antedating evidence, we agree it can come in for background.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.256" offset="11112364">It didn't come in, in this case, for background.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.121" offset="11119888">It came in as the exclusive basis for adjudicating their right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.176" offset="11136084">Now, the further basis upon which the Board says that the six-month period can be breached is that this is a continuing violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.619" offset="11173804">Well, I, in part, explain the concept of continuing violation that is we can adjudicate a complaint valid on its -- invalid on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.889" offset="11214973">Therefore, there's -- we can adjudicate with one valid on its face because there's no difference between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.533" offset="11233468">We think there's a world of difference between the two because with one which is invalid on its face, you do not have to go to any events six months before the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.168" offset="11268054">With one valid on its face, you do and, because you do, we think six -- the Section 10 (b) operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.450" offset="11293132">I've also explained why the distinction drawn by the Court of Appeals, namely, that these are unfair labor practices or violations within the six-month period will not wash.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.292" offset="11332524">The other explanation that we now have, and this is the third variation of the concept of continuing violation is the one in the Board brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.632" offset="11369932">The Board brief says that we agree that execution of the agreement is barred by limitations but continuance or enforcement of the agreement is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.733" offset="11406294">The distinction, as I understand it, is that the execution of the agreement is a completed and consummated act when it takes place, therefore, limitations run as to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.943" offset="11451120">The enforcement is not a complete act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.287" offset="11460524">It is a continuing act and therefore, limitations do not run.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.086" offset="11475675">What it seem -- it seems to us that what this contention does is to separate the consequence of the unfair labor practice from the unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.228" offset="11516322">For the underlying unfair labor practice is rendering assistance to a union by recognizing and contracting with it when it does not half a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.375" offset="11552893">The consequence of that unfair labor practice is to invalidate both the -- invalidate both the execution of the agreement and the enforcement of the agreement to say that the limitations run as to the execution but not as to the enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.092" offset="11607751">It's to have your period of limitations run from the result of the wrong, the damage, the consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.725" offset="11634291">It seems to us that a limitations period must run from the wrong and not from the result.</text>

            <text syncTime="3607.526" offset="14533465">I do not think that it is a new theory, Mr. Chief Justice, because from the beginning, the enactment of 10 (b), the Board has taken the view that it is a statute of limitations and not a rule of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.675" offset="14598040">The effect of it is to bar a liability for an unfair labor practice committed in the past but not to preclude the Board from looking at relevant evidence in the past for the purpose of shedding light on conduct that is occurring within the limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.105" offset="14675780">Indeed, quite early in the Board's experience with 10 (b), you had a number of cases where the union security clause in the contract was defective, in that, instead of providing for 30 days within which to become a union member, it required that you had to become a union member immediately or some lesser period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.181" offset="14828126">These contracts were entered into outside the six months period but they continued to be enforced within the limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.313" offset="14880580">The Board took the position and every Court of Appeals that has considered the question sustained the Board in the view that since the contract continued to be enforced, the statute of limitations in 10 (b) had not even begun to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.268" offset="14964485">Now, the -- it is true that in those cases, the illegality of the union security clause was apparent on the face of the contract, but that was not the rationale on which the Court sustained the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.747" offset="15042330">The rationale was that you had a continuing unfair labor practice going on so long as the contract continued to be enforced for the simple reason that it has been well-established, at least in the Courts of Appeals, that where you have a contract that compels union membership as a condition of employment, you have a violation of the Act not only at the time that you execute the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.026" offset="15175450">The reason for that is that you are forcing the employees to risk discharge if they do not join the Union but thereafter, each time that you enforced the contract, enforce employees to pay dues under that contract or discharge them for failure to do so, you are further invading their statutory rights.</text>
