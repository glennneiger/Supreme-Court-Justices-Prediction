            <label>Mr. Jack Hart</label>
            <text syncTime="14.320" offset="160684">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.261" offset="176462">This case comes here by way of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.273" offset="204466">The question presented involves the construction of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.658" offset="222020">The statute is a short one, consisting of five lines and is printed on page one of petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.871" offset="254830">It's Section 2463 of the Judicial Code which reads as follows, “All property taken or detained under any revenue law of the United States shall not be repleviable, but shall be deemed to be in the custody of the law and subject only to the orders and decrees of the Courts of the United States having jurisdiction thereof."</text>
            <text syncTime="62.078" offset="351692">The question presented is whether under that statute, statute the District Courts had jurisdiction in a summary proceeding instituted by petitioner in order to show cause to determine the claim of a non-taxpayer that his property has been seized and satisfied the tax obligation of a nun.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.841" offset="450748">The District Court for the Southern District of New York, expressly declining to follow the Third Circuit, held that the District Courts had no such jurisdiction and dismissed the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.838" offset="510725">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed in one sentence upon the opinion below.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.086" offset="567672">In this Court, the respondent suggests that the case might be remanded to the Southern District without prejudice to the petitioners requesting that the Court treat the petition as a complaint and that the action then proceed in accordance for the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.925" offset="671117">That suggestion of course is no concession at all because in the current posture of this case, the major issue is whether we are required to proceed in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but whether we have a right would obtain the article quarters of the Court with respect to the time for answer, the time for pretrial proceedings, the time for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.167" offset="800057">The facts in the instant case maybe briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.394" offset="828897">The petitioner, New Hampshire Fire Insurance Company, among other things, is engaged in the business of issuing surety bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.241" offset="864319">In 1956, the petitioner issued a surety bond on behalf of a contractor, Acme Cassa Incorporated which had entered into a contract of the City of New York for the construction of a playground.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.436" offset="925132">During the course of the work which involved a contract to delinquent taxpayer of $356,000, Acme Cassa became financially unable to continue with the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.563" offset="969644">The City of New York as obligee, thereupon called upon the petitioner here to complete the work and pay the unpaid bills of Acme Cassa.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.442" offset="1017187">This, the petitioner did.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.237" offset="1028368">In the meantime, Acme Cassa had become a delinquent taxpayer and the United States filed notices of tax levies with the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.401" offset="1097017">There came a time then when the City of New York had available for payment some $68,000 and this money was in the form of a warrant to the order of this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.048" offset="1147591">At that time, the petitioner had expanded some $83,000 in completing the work and in paying unpaid bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.862" offset="1194820">The Government had a tax lien in the amount of some $35,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.548" offset="1217599">In New York State, the law is the very well established than in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.024" offset="1243512">The surety is obligated to the position of the obligee, in this case the city, and that therefore, the money is payable directly to the surety and accordingly the Government's tax lien, which applied only to the property of the anointed taxpayer has no applicability of law at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.610" offset="1321775">Plainly, we don't deal with the question of priority because the property never goes to Acme Cassa, the delinquent taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.422" offset="1365034">In the District Court, the judge said that we were required to bring a plenary procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.515" offset="1409442">Nobody has said against to whom we are supposed to bring a plenary proceeding and it is submitted to this Court that we are not dealing with the ordinary types of case where you have a plaintiff and defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.010" offset="1475375">The party difficult to pinpoint in this case is the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.650" offset="1509961">The history of the statute, its express language, its evident purpose all make it clear that this property when improperly seized by a person who happens to be a tax collector, but who of course is merely an individual tortfeasor when he seizes the property of a non-taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.791" offset="1618526">That tax as we say very clearly put the property in the custody of the Court subject to the orders and decrees of that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.030" offset="1651440">And for that reason, what we are engaged in doing here is making an application to the Court to return the property.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="394.898" offset="1682996">May I ask Mr. Hart, as of what date in reference to the filing of the federal tax lien did the surety as you put it, definitely (Inaudible) of the contract?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_hart" startTime="407.100" stopTime="450.208">
            <label>Mr. Jack Hart</label>
            <text syncTime="407.100" offset="1731793">The surety came in I think after the filing of the tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.514" offset="1757393">Mr. Justice Brennan, I would say that the -- in our view, the date of the filing of the Government's tax lien is of no significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.984" offset="1787277">It is of no significance because we are not concerned to the question of priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.568" offset="1809638">The contention is and the law in New York is so well established as not to be in doubt that in these circumstances, the delinquent taxpayer never gets the property right to any of the contract balances and the money goes directly from the City of New York to the surety.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.211" offset="1884244">We therefore don't fight for money which belongs to the delinquent taxpayer in any sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.208" offset="1904201">Well, if the -- if that time of the filing of the federal tax liens that you had not yet stepped in use of a contract, to whom did the city at the time of the filing of tax liens owed them?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_hart" startTime="467.208" stopTime="512.020">
            <label>Mr. Jack Hart</label>
            <text syncTime="467.208" offset="1972224">Well, if there are no money would be loaned.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.998" offset="1979329">We are talking here about progress payments of the -- in the usual way.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.221" offset="2000227">There will be a lump sum contract price with prohibitions or payments during the progress of the work as per requisitions made by the contractor in accordance with the terms of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.652" offset="2045994">If he fails to perform, then obviously he would not be entitled to get paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.791" offset="2070549">Essentially, that would be the reasoning behind which -- on the basis of which came the conclusion that the surety becomes subrogated to the position of the owner cutting out the contractor altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.271" offset="2136482">He had no right to get the money because he failed to perform.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Hart</label>
            <text syncTime="516.809" offset="2170650">In this case, I believe it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.953" offset="2179218">I repeat that the -- the term of the filing I think everybody would recognize, in this case had recognized would be insignificant.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.362" offset="2220805">The -- there has been no issue raised about the merits of this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.308" offset="2264586">Nobody has been required to take a position about the right of the surety, but the law in New York is so well established that I don't think anybody would raise any question about the law being what I have stated it would be and namely the very reason that subrogated for the position of the owner.</text>

            <text syncTime="556.726" offset="2330311">Well, then you mean this case comes to us, virtually you and the Government and the other side in agreement that the property did belong to the surety at the time that --</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Hart</label>
            <text syncTime="567.656" offset="2373987">Yes, well, the -- the surety thing subrogated for the position of the owner and its right of subrogation depending on whether it has in fact expanded the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.981" offset="2419336">There are perhaps in some cases whether the city under the circumstances would have had the right to whip all the money from the contractor, and then there's no doubt about that when the contractor has failed to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.054" offset="2467610">There could be questions of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.502" offset="2477432">For example, if the surety had expended only $20,000 and the amount payable was $40,000, its right to subrogation would extend to the extent of $20,000 and not 40.</text>

            <text syncTime="611.155" offset="2547963">The only issue raised in the State is meant that we are applied to institute an action in proceeding by filing a complaint under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure giving a defendant 20 days in which to answer.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Hart</label>
            <text syncTime="692.824" offset="2874702">It's actually so, Mr. Justice Stewart, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.277" offset="2884524">We've been dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.046" offset="2899571">Now, 2463 has an interesting history which I can briefly allude to.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.978" offset="2927261">It was first passed in 1833 in response to South Carolina Ordinance of Nullification.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.237" offset="2964355">The South Carolina didn't like the Tariff Act which had been passed and -- passed some state laws, Duty of Tariff Act is -- Tariff Act fact should not apply in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.258" offset="3012420">Congress then passed a rather lengthy statute making numerous provisions to deal with that situation in South Carolina and 2463 and almost the exact words it has today was incorporated in that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.264" offset="3080443">Many of the sections of that statute and we think on this point as perhaps with some moneys, the respondent in its brief has begged the question here referred to what would be the case if tax collector acting properly under the Tariff Act did what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.729" offset="3174275">We think it's plain that 2463 the section with which we are here dealing must be read by including after the second word back in the statute the additional word improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.202" offset="3248149">Section 2463 specifically deals only with cases where a person who happens to be a District Director seizes or detains the property of a non-taxpayer justifying his conduct on the ground that he is a District Director, but the revenues laws do not apply to non-taxpayers and we are dealing here I might say in all of you with the case we would have if the district director so seized the automobile of Mr. A to satisfy the tax obligations of Mr. B and we are dealing now with the question of who gets possession of the automobile when this dispute arises and whatever has been decided and what are the rights of Mr. A with respect to retrieving his property?</text>
            <text syncTime="845.545" offset="3485550">It seems evident from that point of view that the District Director is not defending that in the case because unless we had 2463, we have difficulty in saying on what basis we could get him into a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.167" offset="3548035">Normally, there would be no diversity present and there was not in present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.586" offset="3581680">And since the charge against him is merely that he is an individual tortfeasee, the case against him, whatever it happened to be, would not arise under any federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="888.584" offset="3657749">That's the very last thing he would claim and it seems perfectly plain that he would not even in his personal capacity contend that he had a right to the possession of the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1369.782" offset="5582451">In this case, the District Director, the City of New York and the contractor, nobody else could seem to have any -- the District Director as a fact of the matter of cause appears by the attorneys for the United States America because if he in fact was a District Director or to put it in other way, if indeed he was acting within the authority of the tax laws, then of course the property goes to the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.363" offset="5708779">But if he was not so doing, then the United States has no interest in this proceeding, the District Director is not involved and an individual will happens to be a District Director is given notice because he is the one who purported to act under the authority of a Revenue Law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1467.577" offset="5973661">The respondent suggests that custody of the law, Mr. Justice Whittaker means that the custody of the collector is being protected against process from other courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1529.664" offset="6222033">Undoubtedly, the Court does not have physical custody of the property, but we think that it has constructive custody of the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1857.730" offset="7534320">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.172" offset="7548008">This case is essentially a case presenting the question of a procedure to be followed where a District Director has allegedly seized property (Inaudible) to a non taxpayer, that is non taxpayer foreign to the assessment that he is trying to collect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.491" offset="7625331">Rule one of Federal Rules of Civil Procedures provides that these rules govern the procedure in the United States District Courts in all suits of a civil nature where the cognizance is always cases at law or in equity with the exception stated in Rule 81.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.679" offset="7702131">As I understand it, there's no allegation here that the exceptions of Rule 81 are applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.009" offset="7727417">Rule 2 provides that there shall be one form of action to be known as a civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.603" offset="7757824">Now, if a party believes that the civil action that he has brought is too slow to give him an adequate remedy, he has other proceedings under the rules that he may take.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.962" offset="7823235">He may under rule 65 of the same injunctive relief that the case should more consider that facts that were presented to the Court warrant and show that relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.656" offset="7870046">If he feels that there's honestly no issue of fact as the petitioner feels here, then after the expiration of 20 days from the filing of his compliant, he may move for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.856" offset="7938800">Now, as the Court well knows, prior to the formulation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures, the procedures that were followed in the District Court were to say the least un-uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.564" offset="7997628">A litigant might be thrown out because he did not complied with certain rules of procedure adopted in that particular State in which the District Court happens to be sitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.298" offset="8052590">Now, we submit that there's no reason to favor under the rules a person in the position of this petition who is in effect getting his day in the Court advanced over another litigant who is claiming possibly in a conversion case that someone has this money illegal and by making that litigant take his normal day in the Court by allowing this litigant come in and move ahead by a show cause order is disrupting what we feel to be the purpose of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which was to provide a uniform procedure of the Federal District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.475" offset="8225311">Now, Section 2463 is almost a verbatim reenactment of the parts of Section 2 of the Act of March 2, 1833 which as petitioner's counsel pointed out was an Act to -- to get around the nullification ordinance that South Carolina had enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.803" offset="8330533">Now petitioner's counsel would have the Court read into the provisions of that Section as well as the Section as it now stands properly -- property illegally seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.746" offset="8390405">I don't believe there's any warrant reading into the present -- the predecessor for the present statute that turns the very purpose of the Act of 1883 or 1833, rather of 1833, was to retain in the District Director custody of property that he had legally seized for duties that were attachable to property being imported into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.856" offset="8518823">The State of South Carolina by its nullification ordinance, a decree that such duties were illegal, yes, but they were not illegal and they were legally seized properties that were seized to pay those duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.295" offset="8588518">The State of South Carolina didn't like that and it passed this nullification ordinance which would allow certain acts to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.442" offset="8621119">One, it allowed for replugging to be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.325" offset="8636688">It would take the possession of his property that had been seized by the collector out of his hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.928" offset="8663124">It made him subject to a penalty of twice the value of whatever property he had taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.893" offset="8694993">Now, we submit that there's no reason to read into that section, the phrase that he now requests to be read in there that it only applicable to the property that was illegally seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.617" offset="8745880">We feel that it is applicable to all property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.652" offset="8777958">Now, even though this property by that section is made subject to the orders of the District Court and decrees to the District Court, it provided that the property shall be very irreparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.700" offset="8850160">Now, the writ of replevin would only test possessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.306" offset="8876596">It wouldn't test owner -- ownership to property, but now instead of the writ of replevin being applicable, petitioner would have you hold that you can go in on a summary proceeding and determine title to property whereas Congress had said the District Courts could not entertain a writ of replevin.</text>
