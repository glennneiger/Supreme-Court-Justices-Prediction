            <label>Mr. Abraham E. Freedman</label>
            <text syncTime="41.300" offset="268622">May it please the Court, there are two basic issues in -- in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.298" offset="284609">The first is whether or not the warranty of seaworthiness attaches so an injured maritime worker working on a vessel which is being prepared for sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.340" offset="328704">There are some facets to that, but that basically is the first issue which relates to the maritime -- with the warranty of seaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.908" offset="362977">The second issue relates to negligence and it's whether or not the shipowner, when he lets out his barge or his vessel for repairs or for any overhauling, anything of that sort whether he is under a duty under his nondelegable duty to see that the work is carried on safely or if he leaves it to the contractor whether under that same nondelegable duty, he is responsible for the negligence of the contractor, so that we have in this case the two issues; one, based on the warranty and the other in terms of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.640" offset="497977">Coupled with either or both of these theories, there is the duty to provide a safe place to work and we say that it is embraced primarily in the warranty of seaworthiness although it is also a part of the duty with respect to negligence also.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.380" offset="560880">I will touch on those as we come to them, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.132" offset="571852">Briefly, the important facts in the case are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.009" offset="591391">The Government had a vessel called the Mary Austin laid up in what they called a “moth-ball fleet” in Norfolk, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.262" offset="628381">In 1951, the Government decided to take the vessel out of the laid-up status, and to prepare it for sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.871" offset="658892">Those were the words in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.628" offset="665893">There was no doubt about the fact that the vessel was to be prepared for sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.156" offset="683969">And it drew up a series of specifications which are of importance in determining the nature of the work which is to be done because that basically determines the duties which are to be attached here.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.110" offset="743842">The work involved not in any respect any major structural repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.294" offset="764531">Indeed, they involved no structural repairs whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.419" offset="781040">They involved overhauling of the vessel, cleaning, and maintenance cleaning out the pipes and so on which had been drained of water during this period of lay-up.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.885" offset="818866">This vessel, the Mary Austin was taken from its laid-up status in Norfolk, taken out and then towed or I should say navigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.369" offset="856900">It's just as much navigated when it's towed as a dead vessel as it is when it's -- when it proceeds under its power over the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.457" offset="893158">It was navigated under tow from Norfolk, Virginia out the Chesapeake Bay, then along the East Coast and up the Delaware Bay into Philadelphia where it was moored to a pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.120" offset="947806">There were two or three piers where it was shipped but it went to another but that's not -- it's not important that we demonstrate that at this point because we have already demonstrated, she was in navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.484" offset="985318">She was towed all the way up from Norfolk and then put at this pier for these repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.202" offset="1008201">The repairs were extensive only in the sense that they involved a great deal of the same type of repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.134" offset="1043937">There was, I think $142,000 bid for the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.030" offset="1059506">That was the contractor, bid that and got the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.164" offset="1079986">However, as Your Honors will see from a -- an examination of the contract itself which is in evidence that there was not -- that were not in any respect any structural repairs as I -- and as I said let alone major structural repairs which is an important aspect of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.145" offset="1159920">Now, the vessel was manned from the time she left Norfolk with a crew of six men, a captain, two mates, two engineers, and a steward who apparently did the cooking for the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.930" offset="1219062">These men stayed whether they stood watch onboard the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.426" offset="1233063">They did everything else that was necessary onboard this vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.907" offset="1246960">During the trip, the logbook shows all of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.531" offset="1257514">And then when it came to Philadelphia, and the contractor sent his men aboard to start doing the work, these same men undertook to inspect and check and finally approve the work as it went along.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.201" offset="1324178">I -- I think it's important that these six men did that because everyone of these six men was a merchant mariner, a seaman, a seaman in the real sense of the word and if these seamen were the men assigned to check and inspect and observe this work as it went along, then it's perfectly clear, at least this seemed so to me, that it was work within their can.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.816" offset="1422608">It was work they knew themselves, it was work that they did themselves and as a matter of fact, the record is replete, I think the record clearly sustains the proposition that this type of work was normally and traditionally done by seamen since time immemorial.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.358" offset="1492825">West himself was injured while working, West was a marine engineer, I should say too, and there were two marine engineers -- merchant seamen on this vessel.</text>

            <text syncTime="377.811" offset="1614660">As a matter of fact, there was no dearth of authority on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.292" offset="1628557">Chief Judge Parker, the late Chief Judge Parker in United States versus Lindgren, in a decision which was affirmed by this Court, although the -- the particular point was not under -- under consideration of this Court, held that this type of repair, overhauling and as a matter of fact, the repairs, if I recall correctly were even more extensive, repairs more extensive to the structure of the vessel than they were in this case, but in any event, the court there held that such repairs were seamen's work, and Lindgren who was employed in that case was held to be a seaman, as a matter fact, under the Jones Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.857" offset="1822804">I would say, Your Honor, that it would be pretty much impossible to get all of the evidence to show what is and what is not seaman's work.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.569" offset="1857599">I think that when Your Honors wander through the cases, and you see what is -- what has been held to be seaman's work, carpenter's work, a complete overhauling of the vessel, then a vessel is divided into three parts so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.841" offset="1906709">First, we have what we call the deck crew, then the engine room crew and finally, the steward's department.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.113" offset="1927816">The deck crew takes care of everything outside of the engine room.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.388" offset="1940877">They maintain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.387" offset="1948923">You have licensed officers who are required under Coast Guard regulations to know how to operate a vessel, how to take care of a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.860" offset="1978807">We have the manuals, normal manuals which are available to Your Honors put out by the Coast Guard and also by others, private text writers in which they show how to maintain the various parts of the vessel, the winches, and the booms and the masts and the tackle and then everything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.617" offset="2037844">These are all matters which necessarily have to be done by the members of the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.530" offset="2057488">If the vessel encounters a hurricane at sea for example and she suffers some damage, it is the crew which repairs it.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.095" offset="2083715">If we go way back, if we -- we might even note in the Laws of Oleron and the Laws of Wispy and so on, we see provision made under circumstances where a man, even when we get back to the pirate days, there's even provision made for some remedies where the vessels are invaded by pirates and damage inflicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.335" offset="2152678">Now, what likewise were the damage is inflicted by storms, hurricanes or any of the other elements, then it is the members of the crew who necessarily have to make the repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.821" offset="2194683">They not only clean the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.225" offset="2204296">The deck at -- the deck crew not only has to know everything about it but they do take care of, maintain and even repair, even structural repairs where a vessel suffers damage at sea because of -- of heavy hurricane.</text>

            <text syncTime="539.711" offset="2262183">That's it's a little hard for me to conceive something so new, a technique so new as the technique of mothballing a vessel which is a post-World War II technique as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.974" offset="2311293">To think of de-mothballing a vessel is something that is so traditionally a function of the crew of the vessel and there're no traditions about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="577.341" offset="2412753">It's been going on now ever since shipping was known.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.639" offset="2429889">There are certain seasons particularly in some areas where vessels are laid up for the season.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.147" offset="2447966">In other areas, vessels are laid up either for lack of business or for other reasons necessary -- sufficient on to the owners.</text>

            <text syncTime="597.447" offset="2493210">Now, when they lay them up, they use all of the preservatives that are known then at that time in order to preserve the equipment, to preserve the machinery, the deck machinery and the engine room machinery and so on in order that it shouldn't rust and in order that no more damage than is absolutely necessary should occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.895" offset="2558934">Now, when that vessel is taken out of laid-up status, and as I said, Your Honor, one of the best examples that I can cite is the Lindgren case which was decided by Chief Judge Parker.</text>

            <text syncTime="937.468" offset="3853249">[Attempt to Laughter] Well, sir, let's take the Pope &amp; Talbot case versus Hawn which this Court decided after Sieracki.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.476" offset="3877282">There was a case involving a ship's carpenter.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.933" offset="3891075">The question there was whether or not the work on a vessel involving a repair, and this was to some extent a structural repair, a repair to a grain feeder which permitted the grain to flow down through chutes into the various holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.647" offset="3953977">Hawn on that case was a carpenter, a repairman.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.895" offset="3966934">Now, prior to that time, I don't know that this Court had ever passed specifically on the point that whether a carpenter engaged in a grain feeder's work was seaman's work.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.847" offset="4006745">Actually, Your Honors, the point is there are two factors which have to come together in determining whether or not it is seaman's work and whether or not it's covered by the warranty which is after all what we're concerned with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.384" offset="4052929">Number one is it afloat to navigable waters so that if a tort occurs, we have a maritime tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.717" offset="4074245">Number two, is it the kind of work which is an aid of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.201" offset="4092217">Now, on this point, I would like to make this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.095" offset="4107786">When we talk about navigation, I think the court below went wrong here and distinguished -- and failing to distinguish what -- what may be known as active navigation from a vessel on idle status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.455" offset="4149164">Of course both vessels are in navigation, one is inactive, but the fact that the other one is on idle status doesn't make it any the less in navigation, it is nevertheless in navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.157" offset="4183960">Now, if the work which is done is in a -- is to put her back into commerce is to prepare for sea, this -- this Court has said in -- in virtually all of the cases on the subject and as I said in the Lindgren case, it made it clear, even in the Third Circuit, other panels in the Third Circuit have made it clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.978" offset="4267238">If it's designed to either maintain the vessel in commerce or if it's designed to put it into commerce if it's been laid-up, it is in aid of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.878" offset="4306840">Now, the only other thing that we've got to determine at that point is whether the services which this particular man is involved in, is the type of traditional seaman service which brings with it, which carries with it the warranty of seaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.454" offset="4373191">Judge Hand on that point made the distinction in the Halecki case which came before this Court recently and he said that all of these services short of a complete reconstruction of the vessel itself, a rebuilding of the vessel itself, all of these services are effectively or may be termed seaman's services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.921" offset="4455006">They are in the aid of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.770" offset="4462425">They are designed to put the vessel back in navigation or in active navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.686" offset="4482069">The fact that the vessel is afloat brings it within the admiralty jurisdiction so we get them outside of the tort if there is one there and secondly, if the services short of the major structural repairs which involve a complete reconstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.764" offset="4530448">For example, in the Berge case, Berge versus United States, Judge Hand there and speaking for the Second Circuit had this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1383.114" offset="5635845">That actually while we make the point here and while it demonstrates that actually, there was, the vessel was manned, I do not believe it makes any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.243" offset="5668342">In fact, I'm -- I'm quite sure that the cases indicate this would be an honor -- an -- an answer to Your Honor, Mr. Justice Harlan's question in the preceding argument if I may -- if I may refer to it while Your Honor was on this point and I think that whether a vessel is manned, actually doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.247" offset="5732394">This Court in Warner versus Norton, 321 U.S., involving a barge, a dead barge as -- which is what we're talking about here, when we say dead barge, we really mean it, a -- a vessel without any motor power of its own and -- and this, the Mary Austin was pretty much the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.983" offset="5795297">So long as the men who are working on it, if they are performing these maritime services in aid of it, then they take the place of the men who normally would be her crew for this purpose and therefore, actually it wouldn't make a difference if the vessel itself was or was not manned by a regular crew, (Inaudible) is entirely irrelevant or -- and -- and even unimportant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.506" offset="5877426">The point is that if the vessel itself is in navigable waters, if the service being performed is a maritime service, in aid of navigation, then I think the cases pretty clearly hold that the warranty applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.452" offset="5945135">In this situation, and I think Mr. Justice Stewart, I think perhaps this might be relevant in answer to Your Honor's question before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.175" offset="5972093">In determining the question of laid-up status, whether the nature of the service themselves, Judge Hand, speaking for the Court in the Berge case and -- and several other cases, the Gerini case and I think another one that we've cited in our brief, pointed out after he reviewed the cases, but where the vessel is being laid up, the services which are being performed to lay it up, may not be maritime services, may not be the kind of services which are designed in aid of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.998" offset="6095391">These are the cases which were cited by my friend in his brief which involved Jones Act cases which are not the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.372" offset="6124857">Here, we do not have any Jones Act case because we're not suing the employer and that's a -- an important distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.862" offset="6150771">I would to reserve -- I've lost track of my time but I would to reserve some time for rebuttal, but I would like to make this point which I think is in further answer to Your Honor, Mr. Justice Stewart's question before and I think rounds it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.267" offset="6208449">If the services are supported in laid-up status or whatever we want to call it, whether it's in mothballs or anything else, then it's to take it out of act of navigation and some courts have held that that service is not a maritime service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.710" offset="6266232">That service is in not in furtherance of navigation and therefore that service is not traditionally seaman's service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.322" offset="6292668">However, up to that point when we get to the opposite extreme, anything which is done to maintain it in the service, in the -- in navigation or to put it into navigation is exactly the opposite and every single one of the cases which my friends cite in their brief here say exactly that, everyone of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.337" offset="6364766">Like the Antus case, where there was a question of laying it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.457" offset="6377200">We had the -- the Horn case where the vessel was being laid up for -- to be used as a storage for soya beans, the Court there held that wasn't any maritime service.</text>

            <text syncTime="1588.867" offset="6458807">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.935" offset="6471137">I should like first to direct attention to a bit of the facts here and ask the Court to remember that as my brother has pointed out, here we have a vessel which has been for many years in what I believe is called the “moth-ball fleet” which is probably all the mothballing there is about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.773" offset="6562461">She had then been brought up to Philadelphia where the cheapest bidder on the reconditioning contract was situated in order that she might be put in shape to be seaworthy to go in to maritime service after this long lay-up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.903" offset="6650964">During the period of the lay-up, they opened up all of her piping, take all of the little plugs and things out of the piping, drain it, blow it out, fill it full of preservatives and put these plugs and things back with just a turn or two to keep the preservative in warm weather from flowing out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.514" offset="6765380">Now, thus, the plugs and whatnot will not stay in place under any pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.402" offset="6796936">So she was brought up and she entered upon her period of reconditioning which the District Court said was the equivalent of homeport structural repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.211" offset="6852211">Now, I don't it all, what the District Court meant by that expression, but that's what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.783" offset="6874467">Now, what took place was that she was in repair for 36 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.207" offset="6908217">The libelant here was injured on the 16th day and 20 more days more of repair was required before the vessel was in condition to be seaworthy for a voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.022" offset="6975509">So you have him injured right in the middle of the thing, of the repair period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.395" offset="6996929">Now, when injured, Mr. West, who was an engineer was kneeling down on his right knee, with his left knee elevated in the low pressure cylinder of the engine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.759" offset="7054399">So you will please note that the repairs were sufficiently major that they had her engines all torn apart and he was down in the cylinder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.542" offset="7097553">While thus kneeling, one of these plugs hit him on the left knee, doing the injuries for which this suit is brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.724" offset="7150320">Now, the record shows that nobody ever did figure out exactly how the plug dropped and hit him on the knee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.274" offset="7176443">But because there was some moisture on the deck or rather I guess on the -- in the cylinder underneath where the plug dropped and because it was known that employees of the repair contractor had put a pressure, a water head pressure on the pipes, it was thought that the repair contractor's people by putting this pressure on the pipes had blown the plug which was only one thread in out and that it had fallen through an arc in space and clipped Mr. West on the knee, doing in the injuries for which suit is brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.462" offset="7341223">Now, I call your attention to the fact as to the seriousness of the repairs that it went on for 36 days and this was in the middle of thing so that it was 20 days more after this before the vessel became seaworthy in any ordinary and real sense and we say she was seaworthy for the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.992" offset="7423352">That is to say she was in the shape that a vessel that goes in to be repaired is in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.693" offset="7446131">Now, the specifications were rather specific that this was the job that had to be done on this piping, so that the Government had disclosed the condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.566" offset="7493674">There was nothing inherently latent about this, everybody knew about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.394" offset="7512900">It was a case of Mr. West and others coming aboard to take care of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.727" offset="7534320">So now, that is the situation on the amount of repairs and their character so far as the record discloses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.404" offset="7581027">Now, the District Court said that she did not have a crew aboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.915" offset="7603075">By that, the District Court obviously meant she didn't have a crew of some 48 men which would have been her normal complement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.107" offset="7635780">There were aboard some people who I believe later became her crew to take her to sea along with a complete complement of seamen, who were not on the Government payroll but were on the personal payroll, if you will, of United States lines, the Government's husbanding agent to see to the supervision of the repair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.512" offset="7733373">They were as my brother said, six in number, not a crew of 48 but six.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.890" offset="7754898">They of course stood watches and they kept logbooks just like you do on a construction or repair job onshore, where also the people stand watches and keep logbooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.335" offset="7800665">So they were of course seamen, because only seamen have the proper people to see whether a repair contractor is doing the job that he's paid to do under the specifications of the contract, now so much for the manning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.944" offset="7871195">Now my brother has suggested that the crew is of course divided into three departments, the deck, the engine and the steward's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.042" offset="7907558">Well, that's true in this kind of a ship, but it should also be borne in mind that on a passenger ship, you also have the pursers department and that entertainers including singers and hair dressers and all such people are of course seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.044" offset="7983522">Seaman as the Court said in Warner and Norton, which my friend here has cited to you, quoting the very great admiralty judge, Judge Hough, “are people who do anything for the benefit of a voyage, not necessarily those who hand, reef and steer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.813" offset="8062621">So the singer, who appears with the band is also doing seaman's work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.165" offset="8091982">And this is why we think that any attempt to approach the analysis of this problem by asking whether a particular thing is seaman's work or not, is apt to be a little empty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.605" offset="8153840">In other words, there is very little that some seaman on some type of ship doesn't do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.350" offset="8180799">All passenger ships have upholsterers and drapers aboard as part of the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.161" offset="8200025">So I assume that upholstering and draping is obviously seaman's work and so we go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.882" offset="8230849">So we submit to Your Honors that this attempt to decide the scope of the warranty of seaworthiness by the nature of the task involved is one that gives rise to very great difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.389" offset="8296887">In the Halecki case, if Your Honors will recall, great difficulty was experienced and Mr. Justice Brennan in a very knowing opinion said that he couldn't quite see the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.252" offset="8348400">Well now, like Mr. Justice Brennan, I have the same difficulty in attempting to do this by the task involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.855" offset="8386748">Let us, however, look at the history of the warranty of seaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.973" offset="8415274">Now, after all, Mr. Freedman's client is trying to recover here for breach of the warranty of seaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.527" offset="8453517">Now, this is an implied warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.715" offset="8466265">Now, let us think for a moment in the abstract, what are requirements for recovery for a breach of warranty, implied warranty of any sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.765" offset="8526451">First, the implied warranty must not be negated by something express in the contract or implicit in the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.280" offset="8568456">Second, there must be reasonable reliance such as a prudent person would have upon the warranty that is implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.170" offset="8612028">Finally, the plaintiff or libelant must rely upon the warranty and be damaged by its breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.999" offset="8659362">Now, let's look at the history of the breach -- of the implied warranty for seaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.865" offset="8698859">Aside from cargo and passenger cases, it takes its origin in the case of Osceola where the Court said there was an implied warranty of the sea -- of seaworthiness of a vessel for the voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.862" offset="8774823">And that it made no difference that the sea that the -- the defect was one that existed without the fault or knowledge of the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.848" offset="8822784">Now Your Honors will recall that Osceola was a case of the ship having been equipped with some gear for putting out the gangway when she came to shore and this was found to be stated in the question certified to be entirely seaworthy and proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.645" offset="8901987">The difficulty in Osceola was that the master put out the rigging to hold the gangway while she was out where the wind would catch her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.685" offset="8938141">The vessel was making some 11 knots and there was an 8-knot wind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.192" offset="8960188">And the gangway thrashed around and hurt the man who was injured and that was the way the case came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.925" offset="8995088">So now you'll notice that this is a question of warranty of seaworthiness for a voyage which is in actual operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.180" offset="9044093">Now, that is the first time that we have the warranty of seaworthiness implied in favor of a seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.684" offset="9086098">Now the next case, if Your Honors please, was Mr. Justice McReynolds' opinion in Carlisle Packing Company against Sandanger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.201" offset="9124133">I'm sure we all remember this in the classical way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.775" offset="9134477">This is the coal oil can case as opposed to the malice case or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.796" offset="9154539">They had a coal oil can, marked coal oil aboard and it had gasoline in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.057" offset="9179617">And it was held by the Court that this was a breach of the warranty of seaworthiness because a coal oil can was warranted to have coal oil in it and not gasoline and therefore, Mr. Sandanger was entitled to a recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.168" offset="9260074">Now, once again please note that this is an implied warranty of seaworthiness for a voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.790" offset="9298526">This happened while he was on the voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.255" offset="9312423">We come next -- oh I might say in -- in Sandanger that Mr. Justice McReynolds emphasized the point by giving as his authority the Silvia and the Southwark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.934" offset="9387133">Now, Silvia was a case involving whether there was a breach of the warranty of the seaworthiness to cargo where a perfectly proper porthole was left open.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.130" offset="9443871">And that it was held there was no breach of the warranty of seaworthiness that these was just negligent management by the officers and crew in not shutting up the porthole when they got in bad weather.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.397" offset="9484936">Southwark was a somewhat similar type of situation in respect to refrigerator machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.376" offset="9512835">Now, this again is the development of the concept and the scope and what have you of the warranty of seaworthiness of a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.458" offset="9553168">It is for a voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.358" offset="9560795">The next case in this Court of importance was of course the Mahnich case this is the Wolf case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.048" offset="9595591">The shipowner put aboard unsound line and sound line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.997" offset="9619310">And he didn't cut the unsound line up into small lengths so the mate took some of the old defective line and rigged the boatswain's chair or something of the sort with it, held that their having of the line aboard in such lengths that it might be used for a boatswain's chair was an unseaworthiness of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.683" offset="9714082">Now, once again, in the course of the voyage, the implied warranty of seaworthiness for the voyage is just same as the warranty of seaworthiness which is made to the shipper of cargo and to the passenger, it is for the voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.167" offset="9780015">Now, we come next to Sieracki.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.232" offset="9792345">You will recall that in loading the vessel, a shackle broke, held that even though the man was not a seaman in the literal sense and was not subject to the discipline which the Court had referred to in Mahnich as the reason why you have the same kind of a warranty in favor of a seaman as in favor of passengers and cargo that is to say that they couldn't look into the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.199" offset="9912195">The shipper and the -- the passenger have no chance, the seaman by reason of the discipline was thought in Mahnich to have no genuine opportunity to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.974" offset="9955244">Now, we come to Sieracki and although there is this difference and although there is no privity of contract between the shipowner and the injured repairman -- the injured stevedore employee, still by analogy to MacPherson and Buick, the privity of contract is ignored and we go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.982" offset="10047300">But still again all, it is the implication of a warranty of seaworthiness for the voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.278" offset="10076453">It is in the course of the loading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.413" offset="10088991">Next in order in this Court comes Pope &amp; Talbot against Hawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.011" offset="10111457">Now, that was a case where with the complete crew aboard, the vessel was almost through loading to go out -- the grain fittings became defective in some particular and the injured man who was a carpenter of a very special type, the kind of carpenters who see to looking after grain fittings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.153" offset="10199960">It's a type of stevedoring work but at the same time it's a type of repair work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.008" offset="10219395">He was injured, held that the warranty extended to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.182" offset="10240084">Now, that seems obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.409" offset="10248965">The vessel was loading for the voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.404" offset="10264952">The shipowner had represented that she was seaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.098" offset="10283760">Cargo was already aboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.800" offset="10294523">Certainly, there was no doubt at that point that there hadn't been a warranty of seaworthiness to every pound of cargo that had been on laden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.220" offset="10324302">So it's held that the warranty extends also to this carpenter who comes aboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.569" offset="10341648">Nothing is more natural, but notice it's in the course of the voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.642" offset="10357948">Next we have Alaska Steamship and Peterson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.230" offset="10380309">This is again loading or unloading for the voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.401" offset="10392952">The stevedore is allowed by the ship to bring aboard a defective snatch block instead of requiring him to use vessel's snatch block, they let him use their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.840" offset="10430777">This was defective, Peterson was injured, but it is once more a breach of a warranty implied of seaworthiness for the voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.070" offset="10475604">Now, Rogers is of course the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.107" offset="10491800">Now, we had it last term, again, in connection with Skovgaard and the Tungus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.670" offset="10522102">There again, the injury was in the course of the voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.636" offset="10549896">They were off loading at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.160" offset="10560031">Now, no case in this Court has held that there may be a recovery on account of breach of an implied warranty of seaworthiness not for a voyage but at some other time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.946" offset="10631189">Now my brother, I see by his argument, urges that this Court say that there is an implied warranty of seaworthiness from the moment the vessel is completed building until she is done and finished and goes to the grave yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.135" offset="10711960">He appears to make an exception to take care of certain cases on account of some kind of major structural repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.601" offset="10745814">Well, of course any such major structural repairs are obviously not in the course of a voyage, but the thing it seems to me that the Court should address itself to instead of looking at the tasks of the workmen, to look at what is the representation and warranty of the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.132" offset="10819897">Now clearly, in the case of Mr. West, and the Mary Austin here, there was no representation by the shipowner that the vessel was seaworthy for a voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.970" offset="10879248">In fact, the whole thing was, she was unseaworthy except to the extent that they were able to tow her up from the reserve fleet down by Norfolk up to Philadelphia where the cheap bidding contractor was situated and then turned her over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.801" offset="10946539">Now, they went on for 20 days after Mr. West was injured in order to get her in shape to be properly seaworthy for a voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.808" offset="10982588">Now, this is the only kind of seaworthiness, it seems to me, which is real seaworthiness, worthy to go to sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.246" offset="11012368">This is what is meant by the warranty of seaworthiness where passengers and where shippers are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.738" offset="11038281">Now, Mr. Freedman not unnaturally says, “Let us imply a warranty of seaworthiness,” seaworthiness now means something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.880" offset="11078928">Seaworthiness means being in good enough shape to be in a repair yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.933" offset="11099094">Now, in our brief, we have very carefully pointed out that two courts below have found correctly in our view that this vessel was in proper shape and in that sense seaworthy to go into a repair yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.330" offset="11160743">We don't think that this is any proper use of the term seaworthiness at all, although goodness knows there have been dozens of judicial opinions which have used the word that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.115" offset="11203793">One of the earliest is that of Judge Parker in United States and Lindgren where he spoke about the seaworthiness of a vessel which had just come from repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.291" offset="11260531">It's a rather special case of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.121" offset="11267845">The man had joined on as the ship's officer the very morning that he was injured and the vessel was just about ready to go to sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.449" offset="11297207">So it differs only a little bit from a vessel really ready to go out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.394" offset="11328972">That is why all of the decisions and all of the decisions as to the warranty of seaworthiness to -- to cargo shippers say, “Well, it's not a matter of principle, it's a matter of fact in each case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.148" offset="11379963">Another case that Mr. Freedman relies on at length in his brief is the Reed case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.364" offset="11400861">Now, the Reed case was a repair case so called, but what we have there was, without ever discharging the crew, at any time, because there was a war on, we had to keep them, they might get -- we might be without a crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.200" offset="11464182">They proceeded to -- in five days, set up latrines and wooden bunks in the cargo holds in order to make a make-shift troop transport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.860" offset="11518830">Now, in that case one of the repairmen was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.330" offset="11532727">We think that under our conception of the warranty of seaworthiness, of course there was a warranty of seaworthiness there because the vessel was -- ended one voyage and began the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.352" offset="11584763">And five days is no more than a normal turnaround even if you didn't have to put some buck -- bunks in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3448.201" offset="13896182">It's so -- as Your Honor, Justice Frankfurter has stated, it's a -- it's a duty imposed by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.325" offset="13916662">It's not contractual in a sense that the parties say I contract, I warrant that it's seaworthy or not seaworthy whatever it may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.216" offset="13948217">The law imposes it on them, and the duty is on the shipowner to make sure or to provide, not to make sure but to provide a safe and seaworthy vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.925" offset="13987088">And if in fact it's not safe, this Court said in Sieracki at so many times that the shipowner is liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.071" offset="14011643">In some sense in -- in some of the cases, they called it a warranty, in some other cases this Court has called it the doctrine of unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.197" offset="14040168">Now, I may say now, I've only already got a couple of minutes left and I would like to cover some of the points that is made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.768" offset="14062425">I would like to say now that the Government has already taken a very, very sharp attack away from the argument which they made in their in brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.328" offset="14088652">As Your Honors will read they briefs, you'll see that they make the big distinction on the basis of major home port structural repairs, if I may quote them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.350" offset="14120730">That's the way -- that's way that Your Honors will find it in the brief, major home port structural repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.511" offset="14141419">Now, they come along and they say that makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.862" offset="14150823">As a matter of fact, the point is that that is the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.050" offset="14163571">That does make the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.391" offset="14172975">I said before in -- in answer to Mr. -- Mr. Justice Brennan's question that we need not reach the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.886" offset="14198888">What I meant was, we need not determine whether if they are major home port -- home port structural repairs, whether the warranty applied in those cases, it applies -- what I meant to say was and this Court should find that it applies at least to that point as Mr. Judge Hand has said as this Court has said in both in Talbot, Justice Hand in Sieracki and the other cases which followed, Peterson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.170" offset="14276002">And I may say too that the -- I disagree very strongly with my friends over here that in all of these cases, that the warranty was applied only in contemplation of a voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.247" offset="14312364">As a matter of fact, despite the contrary, the famous Rogers, there was no voyage in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.896" offset="14334934">In the case of famous Rogers, there was no voyage in contemplation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.620" offset="14349876">They -- this Court found an unseaworthy condition and they overruled -- they overruled this Third Circuit to concur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.388" offset="14372968">Now, there are other cases, the Johansen file that Your Honor said (Inaudible) where that was never made a condition, not once was never made a condition that it must be part in with the voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.017" offset="14411421">How about all of these inland water vessels, the tugboats, the drudgers that never go to sea, they never make any sea voyages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.760" offset="14438379">These too had been held to be mind with under the warranty, the so called warranty to seaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.531" offset="14457501">But whether we call it the warranty of something else, the point is it is a liability for an unsafe condition aboard the ship.</text>
