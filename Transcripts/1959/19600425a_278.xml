            <text syncTime="17.256" offset="172387">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.541" offset="201540">This case is before the Court upon a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.974" offset="231320">The questions presented, stated briefly are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.803" offset="250546">First, whether the contemporaneous notes of a government agent made during the course of his investigation are producible under the statute, Title 18, Section 3500 where that government agent takes the witness stand and testifies as to his investigation as a witness for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.792" offset="350542">There's also presented the question as to whether or not the rule announced by this Court in Goldman versus United States to the effect that the trial judge has the discretion to deny production and inspection of the contemporaneous notes and memoranda of government agents where the government agents have refreshed their recollection from such notes but have not done so on the witness stand, whether such rule has been overruled by this Court in the case of Jencks versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.638" offset="497873">As an adjunct to the questions, there's also presented the question of whether or not the action of the trial court in this particular case in denying production of the contemporaneous notes of the government agent could be characterized as harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.625" offset="573837">As to the facts of the case, the petitioner who has a position was first indicted along with a druggist on a charge of conspiracy to violate the provisions of Title 26, Section 4705 (a), that is a conspiracy to sell certain narcotic drugs without the requisite written orders as prescribed by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.632" offset="677909">That case was tried and resulted in a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.842" offset="694732">After the mistrial, a second indictment was returned against the petitioner solely naming him in 15 substantive counts charging in each of the counts that he sold or caused to be sold the narcotics not in the manner prescribed by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.110" offset="771845">The two cases were consolidated for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.318" offset="792639">After the trial on the conspiracy charge, but prior to the trial on the consolidated cases, counsel for the petitioner moved the court on order requiring the Government to produce certain documents and included in that motion a request for the contemporaneous notes of the narcotic agent, Rudd setting forth in the motion that the Agent Rudd had testified at the first trial and had -- and his testimony shown that the notes related to his investigation and as to the events which he's testified to in the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.438" offset="941119">The motion was denied in all material respects as far as this case is now concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.751" offset="970376">The case proceeded to trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="234.447" offset="1041115">We are relying upon the fact that the motion was renewed during the course of the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.042" offset="1067551">The case proceeded to trial at the close of the Government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.685" offset="1082075">The court granted a motion for judgment of acquittal as to the conspiracy cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.432" offset="1105063">At the end of the -- all of the evidence in the case, the petitioner again moved for a judgment of -- of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.555" offset="1133589">The trial court denied the motion commenting that in his view, it was a very slender case, but he thought that there was enough to go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.130" offset="1171937">The jury returned a verdict of guilty as to each of the 15 substantive counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.286" offset="1192521">A motion for new trial was made and was granted as to five of the counts which were substantly -- subsequently dismissed by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.001" offset="1231391">During the course of the trial, the agent -- narcotic agent Rudd while on the stand testified on cross-examination that he had made copious notes during the course of his investigation and that he had refreshed his recollection from such notes prior to coming to court to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.628" offset="1321880">There was -- after Agent Rudd had testified on direct, cross and redirect, a recess was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.711" offset="1354167">After the recess, this appears in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.194" offset="1368168">The court makes the statement, “I will deny the request for the notes because they may concern many things.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.363" offset="1400874">You may see the case report.”</text>
            <text syncTime="328.603" offset="1417801">The case proceeded on as I've said to the conclusion and a finding of guilty by the verdict as to each and by the jury as to each of the 15 substantive counts.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert A. Warren, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1645.684" offset="6686072">As far as the -- along that line going to Jencks case itself, the action of the defense counsel in that case was a request that the trial judge examined the particular statement involved to see if they could be produced for his inspection, and that was all that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.626" offset="6769873">Now, I think that just so under the same reasoning of the Jencks case, that's all that's necessary to be shown is that the witness has made a prior statement or prior notes relevant to his present testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.727" offset="6822327">Once that is done, then he has established the basis for the production of the notes, under the statute, under the Jencks case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.868" offset="6858794">The next move is then up to the Government to protect itself by asking the trial court to examine the notes and to excise any irrelevant portions before they are delivered to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.540" offset="6909576">Now, proceeding to the next question as to the effect of the Goldman case and the effect to the Jencks case upon the Goldman case, first of all we noted that the Fifth Circuit in deciding this case, decided first of all that the notes were not within the scope of the statute, because as the Fifth Circuit said, the statute relates to formal statements, and statements which would be admissible in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.372" offset="7016887">Now, this Court and Palermo discarded both grounds, and said that the particular statements, that formality was not an issue in determining the producbility of the notes and the fact that they would not be admissible in evidence was also not a fact that could be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.938" offset="7083133">So the basis of the Fifth Circuit in ruling that the notes were not within the statute did not conform with the ruling of this Court in Palermo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.248" offset="7116361">The Fifth Circuit then proceeded to say that the rule of Goldman was not overruled by Jencks and that the trial court had the discretion to deny the request for the notes even though the witness had refreshed his recollection from the notes before coming to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.867" offset="7190862">Now, in Goldman, I think it's important to note the basis for the request of the contemporary notes of the agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.050" offset="7227538">I think that in that case as I read it, the basis of the request was founded solely upon the assumption that because the agent had refreshed his recollection with the notes, that they should be produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.766" offset="7282395">In the Jencks case, the basis for the production of the statements of the witness was the fact that the witness at a time when his memory was precious had made a statement, a record of the events which transpired, that the value of such a contemporaneous statement to the defense in impeaching the witness could not be overestimating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.061" offset="7383646">The fact that the witness had already testified relieved any qualms the Court may feel as far as secrecy of government reports and investigative reports are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.640" offset="7433906">So, that even though the witness may not have referred to his report before coming to trial or had not referred to his report while he was in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.017" offset="7475388">That fact would not prevent the production of the prior statement of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.372" offset="7496808">So to that extent, I say that Jencks did overrule Goldman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.181" offset="7520110">To make myself perhaps a little clearer, we say that if a witness has made a prior statement as to an event about which he is now testifying, if the defense has that prior statement available to him, he has a weapon at his command for impeaching the present testimony of that witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.287" offset="7600567">I think the basis for the ruling in the Jencks case is that it's only fair that those prior statements be afforded to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.199" offset="7632123">Goldman, perhaps still has some vitality if the witness is refreshing his recollection from statements which are not his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.806" offset="7666604">He is referring to some photograph, or some report of someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.708" offset="7682173">Then perhaps the trial court does have discretion as to whether or not the materials used for refreshing recollection should be produced.</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.409" offset="8077040">One point about the question of harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.325" offset="8096684">This -- this Court in the Rosenberg case decided last term, decided that even though the trial court was in error in not requiring a production under the statute of a particular document that it would be characterized as harmless error by virtue of the fact that the same information contained in the documents sought to be produced was already possessed by defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.446" offset="8197204">That can not be said in this present case because we do not have the notes before us, we do not know what was in the notes, we do not know if the notes conform with the case reports, and we do not know if they conform with the testimony of the Agent Rudd.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.545" offset="8261569">Now, the case of Holmes versus United States in the Fourth Circuit which is cited in our brief, I'm pleased to say it takes the same position as the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.761" offset="8338369">First of all, that the notes, reports and memoranda of a government agent are within the literal meaning, literal wording of the statute, 18 U.S.C.Section 3500.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.900" offset="8390928">It goes further and says that since the notes were not preserved in the record that the court had not examined the notes, could not say as this Court did in Rosenberg that the defense was already possessed in the same information which they would've received at the document they produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.324" offset="8460622">Therefore, they could not characterize the error as harmless and reverse the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.463" offset="8481207">A similar case of Bradford versus United States, the Ninth Circuit involved the contemporaneous notes of an agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.104" offset="8515793">The court looked at the notes, but did not preserve the notes in the record, handed them back to the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.801" offset="8542542">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in applying the Jencks case said that is was error not to require the production of those notes because they were shown to be relevant to the testimony given by the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.279" offset="8600534">And they could not say that it was harmless error because again, the notes had not been preserved in the record, they could not look at them and say that defense counsel was already possessed of the information wich he would have received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.644" offset="8653928">So our position just in a nutshell is, an agent has made a prior statement, a prior record of an event which has transpired and has now become very important as to the guilt or innocence of the party being prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.710" offset="8734177">The agent has testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.676" offset="8746088">There's no further reason for the Government to assert that such prior statement of that agent should not be produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.375" offset="8776913">If it is produced, it is relevant to his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.419" offset="8793004">The value to the defense cannot be overestimating, particularly if that prior statement does not now conform to his present testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.229" offset="8828322">A simple justice, I think would require that the document be made available to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.156" offset="8852041">If it's the same as the agent's testimony, no harm is done to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.714" offset="8870222">If it's different then we do have the further step in ascertaining the truth of what actually occurred at the time that the agent made that record.</text>
