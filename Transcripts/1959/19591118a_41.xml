            <text syncTime="803.646" offset="3317948">They seek to argue that insofar as Mrs. Bates is concerned that her conviction can be sustained aside from the question of the validity of the demand for the membership list because they contend that Section E, that she did not comply with Section E by making a full statement to the -- to the -- which they say is demanded through the City Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.611" offset="3421811">This stipulation on -- on page 6, it seems to us forecloses that because the stipulation was that the only manner in which there had been a failure to comply with the ordinance was -- was the failure to give the membership list.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.670" offset="3486072">This is how the case was argued, briefed, tried and treated in the Supreme Court of -- of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.681" offset="3510105">And we do not think that the defendant respondents can at this stage of the litigation say that there is anything else in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.690" offset="3538108">So, our contention is that the only issue in the case in terms of the failure to comply with the ordinance is whether petitioners were required to supply to the -- to the city the names and addresses of their members since they complied in all respects according to the stipulation at trial with every other phase of this -- of the ordinance which is now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.713" offset="3650226">We make two contentions in -- in respect to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.157" offset="3688051">I might -- I might say if I will to complete the facts that both Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Williams were tried separately, that they were convicted and fined.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.347" offset="3732773">They -- appeals were taken to the Supreme Court of Arkansas where the cases, although separate, were consolidated because of the fact that they raised the same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.759" offset="3778435">And the Supreme Court of Arkansas held that our contentions that these statutes are unconstitutional were without merit, with two justices dissented but with no opinion and the case is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.152" offset="3827963">I am advised the City of North Little Rock has not trialed in affirmance here, but Mr. Kemp, in representing the City of Little Rock since the statutes -- the ordinances are the same, I -- I think that the issues which are involved here can -- will be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.713" offset="3906226">Now to -- back to the first question that Mr. Justice Stewart asked me about the differences, I think that what was a alluded to here was that the -- the arguments that I've just referred to that Mr. Kemp believes he can make and which I don't believe he could make here, and that is that there was compliance with the statute insofar as Mrs. Williams was concerned because she gave a more detailed statement in respect to her -- her financial statement which he indicates is required by Section E of the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.486" offset="4049272">But our contention is that in view of the fact that there was -- has been has a stipulation that the only failure to comply with the ordinance was the failure to give a membership list that this contention can't be made and therefore, there is -- there -- there are no differences in the facts, the essential facts in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1016.824" offset="4170689">We contend first that if this is not tax ordinance, that it is unconstitutional in view of the fact that there is the demand for the names and addresses of members and contributors and therefore, that N.A.A.C.P. versus Alabama is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.009" offset="4235368">We contend that if it is tax ordinance as the Supreme Court of Arkansas has -- had held that it is a tax ordinance, that in the application of this ordinance to us that the Supreme Court of Arkansas has failed to meet the standards which this Court held must be met in this kind of situation in Speiser versus Randall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.498" offset="4325334">We contend further that if the Court disagrees with our -- our -- with us and that this is a valid tax ordinance and that it has been applied without due process arguments -- without a due process argument being -- without being able to make a due process argument as to its application that nonetheless, the ordinance is unconstitutional in that, there is no reasonable relationship between the objective of the ordinance which is to determine tax status and the demand that the disclosure of names and addresses of members and contributors be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.525" offset="4465455">Now, the -- the first question that that is -- that this is which we -- it is our view that realistically, that this is not really a tax ordinance, the purpose of this act -- the purpose of this -- of this ordinance in both the Little Rock and North Little Rock was an effort to curb the activities of the N.A.A.C.P. branches in those areas because it has been found that the -- the most effective way to curb the activities of the association in areas in the South is by the publication, public disclosure of the names of the members and contributors because this has, as the record in this case discloses, fact is frightening things for people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.821" offset="4658657">And what will happen is the people become afraid to participate in the organizational activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.359" offset="4684779">They are often as the record also discloses when they are so identified as Mrs. Williams and so forth, they are subject to various pressures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.782" offset="4722500">So that, our view it is that this was the purpose of the ordinance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1173.475" offset="4797315">We went -- we attempted to indicate in the record to -- to obtain testimony from the -- from those who were the authors of the ordinance as to what its purpose was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.390" offset="4872965">And in this, to attempt to show that in -- insofar as the purpose of the ordinance was concerned and that, that there was testimony in the record by the sponsors of the two ordinances, that what was desired was to -- in one instance to find out what was going on in the organization and secondly, to find out whether there were violations of gambling ordinance and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.720" offset="4970245">We believe, we don't to -- in order to show this, we think of course that from the -- from the stand point of the legal position, in which we are at the present time, we maybe required to accept and the -- the Court may not want to go behind the analysis of the ordinance which the Supreme Court of Arkansas has made up, and that is the -- the tax ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.305" offset="5068570">But our -- my argument was addressed to the fact that what I considered to be the realistic purpose of this ordinance that we call the "Bennet Ordinance" which is the -- the Attorney General of the State of Arkansas and there has been no reasons, we think, to support the ordinance on any tax for a tax purpose shown in this record or by the Supreme Court of Arkansas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.195" offset="5768129">Now, if I may bring the Court's attention to page 5 of our brief?</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.855" offset="5806791">State of Arkansas, in 1947, enacted Section 19-4601, the pertinent portions of which we've set out on page 5 and top of page 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.606" offset="5861752">This was a grant to municipalities in the -- in the State of Arkansas of authority to secure from persons, firms and corporations engaged in various kinds of businesses and professions and callings in their respective communities, a privilege or a license tax for the -- for the privilege of doing business, of doing this kind of business within the confines of the city, an annual license tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.107" offset="5995813">The statute sets out that the -- this -- the municipalities are empowered to -- to levy the tax on the trade, on the -- on the character of the -- to differentiate of -- with respect to the character of the calling and they can levy it on the goods and stocks, but they cannot make a levy on -- on income or earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.534" offset="6101556">Pursuant to this grant of authority, and I'm only going to discuss Little Rock because -- Little Rock of the ordinance because of the facts that as I've indicated, they are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.474" offset="6153279">Little Rock enacted an ordinance, 7444 and this ordinance may set a various classifications of persons who were at trades, businesses and callings within the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.660" offset="6213987">This ordinance, a copy of which in the record in the clerk's office, we did not print it, levies a tax either a flat tax on it -- on a profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.778" offset="6242513">It levies a tax based upon the character of the business for example, a tax is graded in the on with respect to parking lot, the tax might be graded based upon the number of cars that are parked each day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.538" offset="6317537">The tax on mechanic shops, the tax may be levied based upon the number of -- of persons who are employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.429" offset="6353063">There are -- in this particular statute, there are about a thousand classifications which are subject to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.692" offset="6382111">In order to engage in the occupation listed, before you can engage in this occupation, you are required to pay this particular fee and to pay it annually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.701" offset="6426206">The city collector then issues you a license in your name, indicated for what period it is supposed to operate and you are required that have this license on public display in your place of business and -- and if you are an attorney, you'll -- the license is supposed to be in your office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.247" offset="6504364">Now this ordinance, 7444, was amended several times when various other businesses came into the city and added classifications where to -- were taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.018" offset="6559431">The Supreme Court of the State refers to a Section 7809 and I would point out to the Court that on page 15 and 16 of petitioners' brief, we have listed the various amendments and where they will be found in the unprinted record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.462" offset="6637171">17809, which the Supreme Court of Arkansas refers to, granted to charitable institutions, who engage in the business of manufacturing or selling, an exemption from the payment of the license tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1659.095" offset="6739780">You will note that this ordinance recites that the -- and it's whereas clauses, that whereas many organizations claiming exception from 7444, the original occupation license tax, are that their claim of exemption is a mere subterfuge and that they are really operating for profit and therefore, this ordinance was passed in order to determine tax there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.778" offset="6854510">The Supreme Court of Arkansas construes our position in this particular litigation as being that the N.A.A.C.P., one, is subject to -- to 7444 and its amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.301" offset="6908531">In other words, that we are either engaged in an occupation or some kind of occupation which is subject to tax, and two, that we have claimed an exemption from the occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.270" offset="6960462">There is no evidence in the record to establish by the city that; one, that the association has engaged in any occupation which is subject to license under this statute -- under these ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.275" offset="7008423">Two, there is no evidences in the record that we have claimed any exemption because of the fact that not being engaged in the occupation which was subject to license, we had no occasion to claim any exemption at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.329" offset="7060668">Nonetheless, the Supreme Court of Arkansas in its opinion presumes that we are seeking tax immunity and therefore that we are subject to the -- to this ordinance and therefore holds that we could be required to give up our membership list and therefore be required to comply with the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.033" offset="7131512">We think that under this construction of the law and of the ordinance that this is clearly within the area which this Court condemns in Speiser versus Randall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.369" offset="7180831">Our position is that if the City of Little Rock is to bring the association within the confines of this particular ordinance, it would have to show that we are engaged in some occupation which is subject to license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.193" offset="7244152">And that we have either not paid it for the demand for -- for payment of a fee has been made upon the -- the N.A.A.C.P. that they have failed to do so and that they are claiming tax exemption and tax exemption from the payment of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.864" offset="7294830">We contend that this would have to be shown or else the application of the ordinance to us is a violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.823" offset="7326699">It's clearly a violation of the standards which this Court said have to be met in the area of -- where free speech is involved as it was indicated in Speiser versus Randall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.066" offset="7371630">Now, as far as we're concerned, we think that this was the construction placed on it, it was now placed within the ordinance, and the -- the ordinance has been invalidly applied to us for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.036" offset="7431502">But to -- to end on my final point, if the Court, and this we say that if the Court is persuaded, this Court is persuaded that the Supreme Court of -- of Arkansas in assuming that we, that the -- the organization was subject to the ordinance and in assuming that the organization was seeking a tax exemption without having any facts in the record upon which to base that assumption, if it could do that and not raise serious due process questions, then our contention is that the ordinance is still bad because 7444 which is an occupation license tax, as I had attempted to indicate applies to the character and kind of business or to the amount of stock and a determination as to whether or not an organization is invalidly seeking tax exemption from its application in our judgment, has nothing to do with the -- who the members are or anything of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.735" offset="7726268">It has to do with the activity of the organization and we say therefore that insofar as the ordinance seeks the disclosure of the names of our members and contributors that this does not further, what is the purpose of the ordinance and therefore at best, there can be no -- there is no reasonable relationship between the two and the statute must fall.</text>

            <text syncTime="2265.731" offset="9166346">I might point out to the Court that we've taken the position insofar as we could in an attempt to comply as nearly as we could with these various regulations even though we might have a -- a constitutional claim except insofar as the question of our membership list was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.045" offset="9255581">We could have, we think take -- taken the position in this case that the ordinance had no application to us and that we would not give up any of the information which the ordinance demanded, but our view was that we should do as much as we could in compliance with this, except with the -- the basic issue which affects the freedom of association of our members and the -- the effective activity of the organization itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2330.194" offset="9424123">Counsel made reference to the distinction between the cases here and I'd like to make one reference to that as a City Attorney for the City of Little Rock, I can speak only for that City and do not propose to -- at all refer to the trial and the matter involved in the City of North Little Rock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.356" offset="9512835">I do however have limited knowledge of certain -- certain testimony and matters of record in the North Little Rock case and that it is combined with our transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.854" offset="9570826">We referred to a distinction between the two because specifically, one of the defender, rather the defendant in North Little Rock case as I remember, it has -- was privileged without the objection of the city to make statements regarding the adverse effect which the revealing of this information would have on the N.A.A.C.P. and her city, that is the new membership dried and possibly the loss of old members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.476" offset="9693288">Those questions were not -- no testimony was made in the Little Rock case that was admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.369" offset="9720874">It was read into the record that certain witnesses would have testified to facts concluding that this information if revealed would and possibly had affected their membership, but those are some of the distinguishing features which we think make the cases entirely different and therefore, we would confine ourselves to the Little Rock case only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.385" offset="9836962">Mr. Carter confines his argument and I'm very surprised that he has, to the fact that this is not a tax ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.792" offset="9878549">We wonder what the Supreme Court of the State of Arkansas or how it could have made it more clear that this was an ordinance designed to aid the City of Little Rock in determining whether or not taxes were proper against alleged charitable and nonprofit organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.425" offset="9969037">Certainly, if in this case the N.A.A.C.P. were privileged to make a self-serving declaration and have it go by the Board without contest and without being able to pierce the veil and determine if the facts alleged therein were in fact true, if that were the case, then it is entirely possible that no revenue at all would be forthcoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.156" offset="10071960">They feel that its -- it is possible further that if they're unable to go behind this statement, a self-serving statement, that not only this organization, and I don't refer to the N.A.A.C.P. as -- I refer to it only because it's a petitioner in this case, because there were other organizations that did furnish information required by this ordinance and it's reflected in the statement in the letter of Dr. Crenshaw who originally contacted the city, relative to this thing for the N.A.A.C.P.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.518" offset="10217409">He, in that letter admitted that various – several -- various under organizations had been readdressed to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.175" offset="10240084">Now, if those organizations who claim immunity and I inject here that I don't think it's necessary that a claim be made from immunity in order to have this ordinance in effect, but if those organizations claiming immunity from the previous tax laws, are privileged to continue to be active in -- in any community, in any state, without revealing factors upon which the governmental agencies or bodies could in fact determine if they really were non profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.603" offset="10385742">They could be engaged in activities that produce revenues far in excess of the imagination of most of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.854" offset="10410820">They could be engages -- engaged in a profit venture, only by being able to determine these factors from our own investigation or from the city's investigations can we be assured that the taxes which are justly due are received by the city.</text>

            <text syncTime="3590.129" offset="14463875">We, in -- in this case had attempted to get this case tried and the issues resolved in (Inaudible) and -- and before the Court and for that reason the stipulation was made that petitioner had failed to comply with the provisions of the ordinance and that she was (Inaudible) to the jurisdiction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.684" offset="14562095">Now, if I may just briefly and in conclusion, touch on the matter of, what I thought was the petitioner's point in his lawsuits and that is that this case is -- is to be determined by the case of Alabama, the N.A.A.C.P. versus Alabama, recently decided by this Court wherein this Court held that the requirement by court order for the revealing of membership list was a depravation of the rights of the First Amendment and that as such would be void.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.314" offset="14728652">But that Court in -- in the Alabama -- this Court in the Alabama case also identified an exception, namely if there is a controlling justification for an alleged deterrent effect, a controlling justification barred the deterrent effect which the revealing of this information might have, then the Court here will balance the interest of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.079" offset="14851636">The Constitution gives that balance between the individual and the government so that it is not always a -- a paramount right which can never be subjected to -- to some sort of governmental investigatory power or authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.356" offset="14924779">Further, this Court, in the matter of a recent decision, Uphaus versus Wyman, 360 U.S., a 1959 decision, again confirmed the holding in the Alabama case by stating that and I quote, "Whether there was justification for the production,” they were producing a list of the guest at a summer camp and the -- and the defendant denied that this was a proper being in view of the holdings of the Alabama case and the Court says, "Whether there were justification for the production timed on the substantial question of the State's interest in obtaining the identity of a guest when weighed against the individual's interest asserted by the fellow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.256" offset="15104397">The Court found certainly that the -- the State was privileged or should be privileged to investigate and determine whether or not, there were Communists in the -- in their State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.073" offset="15147656">I think unless this Court can agree that the State or the city of -- whatever political subdivision we have in -- has the authority and the power to determine whether or not a tax is due, then that government will deteriorate without taxation, without revenues, it just can't function and perform and render the services which the public are entitled to and demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.372" offset="15252877">Therefore, there is a justification, a controlling justification for whatever aspect, the revealing of this information may have had or may in the future have.</text>

            <text syncTime="5141.448" offset="20669210">My understanding of Arkansas law is that a pubic record is -- is -- that there is an entitlement on the -- the public access to it and this was set out in a decision, Collins versus State which is at 143 Southwest Second 1, in which the Supreme Court has -- has determined what is a public record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.185" offset="20760116">So, that I -- I think that the interested party, information that he is dealing with concerns a definition of what is an interested party and litigation and not with the kind of problem that we have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="5188.784" offset="20858546">Where did it appear in the opinion of the Court that the -- this ordinance was interpreted as applying only to members as of -- as reaching membership in contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.009" offset="20907447">I might refer the Court to the top of page 71 where the -- of the record on the case where the -- in the -- in the opinion of the Court where it says that -- about the third sentence that each in prosecuting her appealed to this Court raises this federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5225.184" offset="21004100">The ordinance involved insofar as it requires the names and addresses of their member of and contributors to the local branch of the N.A.A.C.P. is an invasion of rights etcetera in all questions merge into this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5237.946" offset="21055195">And I might also refer the Court to page 76 further on in the discussion of the opinion, at the top of the page about, mid the -- the paragraph when the -- there's a -- the -- the Court seeks to distinguish N.A.A.C.P. versus Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.583" offset="21133667">That says that the ultimate aim in N.A.A.C.P. versus Alabama was to stop the activities of the N.A.A.C.P.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.254" offset="21160417">But in the case at bar, the disclosure of N.A.A.C.P. list of members and contributors is a mere incident to see if legal taxation is being evaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="5280.297" offset="21224573">So, I think that the -- this has been the -- this -- the -- this ordinance has been interpreted to reach members and contributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.705" offset="21254144">Finally, I would like to point out to the Court that this 7444 as I indicated before, list various occupation under which there is this -- this occupation tax with the listing of what the amount of the tax is and the taxes on the business on the -- on the activity is not -- is indicated on any organization itself.</text>
