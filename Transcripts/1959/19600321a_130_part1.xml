            <text syncTime="28.779" offset="218467">This case comes here from the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.619" offset="233827">It challenges the validity of a deportation order that was entered against the petitioner based on a finding that the petitioner was a member of the Communist Party from 1937 to 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.543" offset="301537">The petitioner was born in Finland in 1908.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.951" offset="319195">In 1909, when he was 9 months old, he entered this country and was admitted as an immigrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.708" offset="350229">He has lived in the United States ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.019" offset="363499">He is married to a native-born citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.849" offset="378755">He has citizen step son.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.555" offset="389622">His aged parents live here as do both his sisters.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.771" offset="410415">In 1950, 11 years after the period of alleged Communist Party membership in this case, Congress for the first time enacted in the Internal Security Act, a requirement that all aliens who had been members of the Communist Party at anytime after entry must be expelled from the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.090" offset="507695">In 1952, deportation proceedings were started against the petitioner under this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.380" offset="536848">Two witnesses testified that he had been member of the Communist Party in the period of 1937 and 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.453" offset="569135">He did not testify and a deportation order was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.503" offset="589406">The deportation proceeding was then reopened in order to allow the petitioner to apply for suspension of deportation as had become possible by reason of the enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.763" offset="654399">Now at the reopened hearing, petitioner did testify and at the reopened hearing, he testified for the first time that he had never been a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.296" offset="704554">And he explained his failure to testify to that fact originally at the original hearing, by saying in effect that he figured that the original hearing that he did not have a chance when he saw that the service had produced two witnesses to testify contrary to the fact and particularly when one of the witnesses was a person who had never seen him in his life.</text>

            <text syncTime="212.486" offset="953344">And the special inquiry officer who presided at the reopened hearing chose to believe the services witnesses and disbelieved the petitioner and he repeated his finding of deportability.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.561" offset="1001618">He also denied suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.033" offset="1015515">The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.276" offset="1032443">Following that came this Court's decision in Rowoldt against Perfetto and the petitioner moved the Board of Immigration Appeals as he could under the regulations to have the deportation case reopened and reconsidered in the light of the Rowoldt decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.196" offset="1116139">The Board of Immigration Appeals denied the motion and refused to reopen the proceeding on the ground that they were satisfied with the evidence in the light of Rowoldt and that the evidence satisfied the Rowoldt decision.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="335.269" offset="1444446">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.732" offset="1450297">There's a transcript of the record known as the separate supplemental transcript of the record which was printed late.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.877" offset="1478928">Now, the first issue in this case is whether the deportation order is justified by the evidence in the light of the Rowoldt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.174" offset="1520097">Now, in Rowoldt, this Court held in effect that the statute requiring the expulsion of aliens who had been members of the Communist Party did not include every member of the party in an organizational sense even though like Rowoldt, the individual had actually joined the party and been accepted by it as a member and the Court limited the term “member” for the purpose of the deportation statute to a person who had what the Court described as a meaningful association with the party and whose affiliation had what the Court described as political implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.308" offset="1700655">Now in the present case the evidence regarding membership and the nature of the membership can be summarized, I think, as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.148" offset="1735973">The petitioner as I have said denied membership of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.389" offset="1756975">The service witness Knight however testified that he and the petitioner had been members of the same party unit from 1937 to 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.787" offset="1802533">And Knight testified that during this time, the petitioner attended about 30 to 35 party meetings and then he paid him 25 cents a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.508" offset="1845373">He said that petitioner had been on the executive committee or executive board of the unit but he did not say for how long or what the petitioner did if anything in that capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.845" offset="1894797">He did say that, the petitioner had never been an officer of the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.769" offset="1918412">He also testified that the petitioner was not interested or knowledgeable in communist theory or political discussions but said he was interested in the discussions of “bread and butter” and welfare topics.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.247" offset="1976404">And it is clear both from Knight's testimony and from the petitioner's testimony that the petitioner was and he is thoroughly ignorant of Communist Party doctrine and literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.965" offset="2031261">Now, the Board of Immigration Appeals expressed doubt about Knight's credibility, but it found that his testimony was corroborated by the second service witness, a man by the name of Wilmot.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.054" offset="2083610">Wilmot was in a different class than either the petitioner or Knight, both of them were working men, Wilmot was intellectual.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.842" offset="2122689">In the critical period he was the editor of an official C.I.O. newspaper which he testified was controlled by members of the Communist Party including himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.523" offset="2173471">Now, Wilmot did not claim like Knight, Wilmot did not claim to be a member of the same Communist Party unit or section as the petitioner but he testified that as editor of this paper and as a communist he would get around to various Communist Party sections and he testified that he saw the petitioner at some close party meetings and that he once saw the petitioner pay dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.866" offset="2290813">He also testified that the petitioner would come to the office of the C.I.O. newspaper which although, it was the C.I.O newspaper, he sort of callused with also being a communist organ, said petitioner would come to the office of the newspaper once or twice a month to get copies for circulation purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.214" offset="2368240">And that on sometimes on those visits, he would sit in on discussions held by communists who were on the staff of the paper and Wilmot quotes these discussions, “close the party meetings”.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.807" offset="2426650">Wilmot said that he considered that petitioner was in what he called “the top fraction of the party”.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.204" offset="2452146">Now, I don't -- he didn't say what he meant by “top fraction” but if he meant anything significant, I think, it is clear from the record that this bit of testimony about “top fraction” which was relied on heavily below and it's relied on heavily by the Government was a wholly unsupported and unreliable piece of sheer opinion testimony which furthermore, is inconsistent with the testimony of Knight who was in a better position to know the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.006" offset="2567398">I may say that when you read the opinion of the Board of Immigration Appeals and of the court below, they constantly emphasize the evidence against the petitioner and either slur over or ignore the evidence in favor of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.600" offset="2637824">The petitioner testified that he had never seen Wilmot in his life before the hearing and that Wilmot had never seen him.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.257" offset="2668440">Now, I think that a fair assessment of the government's evidence assuming that one disbelieves the petitioner is not more than that the petitioner had been organizationally a member of the Communist Party that he attended meetings, that he paid dues of 25 cents a month, that he was ignorant of and not interested in communist theory and literature but he was interested in discussions of “bread and butter” matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.428" offset="2773034">Now, this evidence it seems to me, falls far short of the evidence about Rowoldt whom this Court held was not a member of the Communist Party for the purposes of a deportation statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="691.434" offset="2869060">Now, I believe -- I -- I believe that it is in the record he went through high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.659" offset="2889958">Rowoldt joined the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.444" offset="2901138">Rowoldt was accepted by the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.613" offset="2909811">Rowoldt paid dues and Rowoldt attended the meetings and that's the most if you can say about the petitioner here, but in addition, Rowoldt had intellectual and political sophistication that this petitioner doesn't have.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.631" offset="2965922">And unlike this petitioner, Rowoldt had read communist literature, he knew its language, he was interested in its view of society and there to some extent insofar as he understood the pack and he agreed with it and moreover Rowoldt carried out in assignment from the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.515" offset="3037393">He ran a party book shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.587" offset="3049723">Now, the government distinguishes Rowoldt on the ground that in Rowoldt, Rowoldt himself described the nature of his membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.510" offset="3085458">Now, the petitioner didn't do that here because he -- instead of describing the membership he denied it, but it seems to me, that the -- if what is important is the nature of the evidence then what is important is what the evidence shows or fails to show about the nature of the membership and not who the evidence and not whom the evidence came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.980" offset="3175320">Now, actually, it seems to me, in order to sustain this deportation order consistently with Rowoldt, you have to take the position and it's the position that has been taken by the Board of Immigration Appeals if not in this case, as I think, they had taken this case, in numerous cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.957" offset="3259225">You had to take the position that initially the obligation of the service is merely to prove organizational membership in the Communist Party.</text>

            <text syncTime="1099.313" offset="4500668">The clauses in the first class can be described as a kind of deferred exclusion because on their face, their purpose is to aid the screening of arriving aliens and basically they require the expulsion of aliens who are in this country for clauses which existed at the time of entry and they deal with aliens who either were not admitted for permanent residents in the first place or would not have been admitted for permanent residence in the first place if at the time of entry all pertinent facts were known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.700" offset="4658134">And if I might give examples of this, you have the aliens who are expellable because they entered without inspection or because although they were admitted, they were in fact for reasons that no one knew about excludable by law at the time of entry or they are paid entry papers by fraud or they became institutionalized or public charges within five years after entry, but for reasons which appear at the attributable to the conditions which existed at the time of entry or they entered for a limited time or purpose and overstayed their leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.095" offset="4815705">Now, the great majority of deportations and I'm not talking about exclusions, I'm talking about expulsions, the great majority of expulsions are for such clauses and they involve people, for the most part, who have not had long residence in this country and who were not entitled to act on any assumption that they have been accepted for permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.003" offset="4907342">Now the second class of expellable aliens consist of those who were lawfully and regularly admitted for permanent residence as to whom there was no mistake on admitting them, who made their homes here in reliance on their screening and acceptance by the Government, but who then become expellable solely for conduct which occurred after entry and which cannot be trudged to or derive from conditions existing at the time of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.639" offset="5037955">Now, these expulsions comprise only about one-sixth of the total deportation or total expulsions which occur in the 40-year period from 1908 to 1948 and these aliens fall into four major groupings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.541" offset="5117576">The majority of them, the great bulk of them, are aliens convicted of certain crimes who are deportable for that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.908" offset="6706970">And I think, that that was really -- that degree of standard of proof was applied by this Court in Bridges against Wixon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.483" offset="6749288">And in Jordan against De George you carried over a criminal test, a test of criminal statute, to deportation, to expulsion precisely for the same reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.618" offset="6805817">And it would not be unreasonable therefore to carry over what amounts to a proof beyond unreasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.715" offset="6838209">I would like to, in my part of the argument, just say a one word about the meaning of the word “member of the Communist Party in the deportation statute”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.681" offset="6890141">Now I think both the Government and we agree that it would be good if there could be a more specific definition of that term than is supplied in the Rowoldt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.737" offset="6942281">Fortunately, such a definition or more specific definition has been proposed by the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.820" offset="6966627">He hasn't proposed it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.435" offset="6973106">He hasn't proposed it for the purposes of deportation statute, but he did propose it in the Scales case and he has proposed it in the Scales case for the purpose of the membership clause of the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.882" offset="7026918">And this meaning was given to the jury in Scales' the second trial at the request of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.467" offset="7069236">Now, the theory of the definition is that the Solicitor General advanced in Scales, as I understand it, is that the Communist Party is such a special kind of organization that it has two kinds of members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.991" offset="7123362">One are the real members, the active people, the people that really contribute to the purposes, the sinister purposes attributed to the party, it says, “They are the people that Congress really has in mind, the stereotype of Communist Party members in anti-communist legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.310" offset="7200580">Then there are a lot of other members or at least some other members who are unofficial members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.314" offset="7224613">They think their members but they're not members in the sense that Congress had in mind and they are not the active members and the Solicitor General's definition of between the active member and the nonactive member and he helps us, what he calls – he defines active member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.356" offset="7300786">And the suggestion he made on defining active member for the purposes of the Smith Act ,which I suggest you translate to the deportation statute, is that a member is active if “he might know -- that he is one who “must have voted all or a substantial part of his time and efforts to the party”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.476" offset="7397230">Now if that definition is a test, obviously it wasn't meant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.229" offset="7416247">And obviously, it seems to me, that this test of activity is the minimum needed to make any sense out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.261" offset="7448430">It makes no sense, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.212" offset="7456266">It is just the irrational and cruel to banish a person from the land where he's lived all his life except for the first nine months and to destroy his family of Americans for what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.111" offset="7511855">Merely for attending years back some meetings and paying 25 cents a month due and otherwise being inactive, innocent and thoroughly uninformed member of the Communist Party or any other organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.423" offset="7569115">At a minimum, and this minimum would be supplied by the Solicitor General's activity test, at a minimum you should require that there'd be a showing that this alleged member did something to substantially promote the organization and its activities beyond just belonging to it in a routine sort of way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1913.455" offset="7757197">And their theory, it seems to be, that the only people that are reluctant to be reformers are unreformed communist, and secondly, that -- that he had joined the Methodist Federation for Social Action after he has been ordered, deported, and that he didn't -- and that he didn't think very much of the Immigration Nationality Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1976.415" offset="8009017">Let me further say that I'm a little a bit odd to stand up here and (Inaudible) in part the arguments have made -- were made by Joseph. H. Choate in 1893 in the case Fong Haw Tan that has been referred to by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.432" offset="8077145">In arguing the constitutional -- the constitutionality of this Act, I shall address my remarks that this Act is a bill of attainder, it's an ex post facto law or denies due process or denies freedom of speech under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.125" offset="8143914">Now in the setting of the control of the immigrants, I think it must be understood that when the Constitution was adopted mostly by lawyers in 1787, that they -- this was -- these were people who were immigrants themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.608" offset="8217788">Immigrant has a special meaning and connotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.077" offset="8235656">Everyone who -- that they are persons that people of this land as of that time were immigrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.159" offset="8260002">The bills of attainder and ex post facto of the laws were well known to the lawyers who drafted the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.723" offset="8294275">Now, in the body of the Constitution there is no -- there is no division between the citizen and person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.370" offset="8328861">It's is the Constitution directs itself to people and to persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.893" offset="8350908">The -- in the first article of the body of the Constitution that was put in by the constitutional convention, the drafters of the Constitution they put in -- in the first article that their -- that Congress shall pass no bill of attainder nor ex post facto of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.340" offset="8436694">Now, when that was submitted to the people in 1789, they -- they added the first ten amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.029" offset="8463444">Now the -- the First Amendment was not directed to citizens, it was directed to persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.735" offset="8490297">The Fifth Amendment guaranteeing due process was directed to persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.338" offset="8512763">So in that setting then, we must now look then at what is the extreme of constitutional history as it relates to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.810" offset="8562604">The Constitution also provided that the Congress could enact and would -- and was delegated authority to enact a uniform method of naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.046" offset="8615581">The body of the Constitution also directed that the Federal Government could regulate foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.556" offset="8649644">Now, there -- there is no specific provision in the Constitution about deportation of aliens that's the essence of what has been included in the body of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.169" offset="8696038">Now, in that light, I would like to call the Court's attention to the first case that I can find where this Court had occasion to look at the question of bill of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.083" offset="8755702">In 1782, the sovereign State of Georgia passed a law in which the legislative body said that, “Any person who had supported the British in the revolution was banished and had no rights to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.360" offset="8828844">Mr. Cooper was -- apparently had lived in Georgia had supported the British king and he sued on a 1000 pound note.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.307" offset="8864580">The defense was that he had no rights to the courts of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.228" offset="8880253">Now the Circuit Court of Georgia sustained that defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.490" offset="8897285">The Supreme Court of Georgia did likewise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.666" offset="8906062">This Court in 1800 reviewed that legislation and reviewed this defense, in the four opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.507" offset="8941380">The -- it was said that in two of opinions, that since it did not appear from the record that Mr. -- that Mr. Cooper was -- had committed the act of treason in any county in Georgia, it -- they're forced then not a bill attainder meaning and accepting the -- then well know definition of a bill of attainder, that is a legislative act which imposes a punishment and substitute the word penalty because it means pains and penalties less than death, historically without a judicial trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.251" offset="9088397">And so therefore, they said there was no denial of a judicial trial when it did not appear from the record that he was triable for treason in any county in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.394" offset="9128939">Now, -- but in any event Mr. Justice Chase said I question the power of -- of the Supreme Court of the United States to declare invalid a legislative act of a State, this was before Marbury versus Madison in the whole stream of history -- of judicial history of Baghdad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.175" offset="9196022">The -- but they said in any event this was an act passed in 1782 before the adoption of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.893" offset="9234996">Now, the -- the next it seems that the bill -- bill of attainders, historically and before the adoption of the Constitution has arisen from legislation that occurred during a period of great political excitement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.863" offset="9294869">In following the civil war, you have the illustration of the Constitution of -- of State of Missouri which imposed a test oath, a person had to sign an affidavit to preach, to teach, to be a lawyer, among other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.530" offset="9357458">He had to sign a test oath that he had not supported the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.209" offset="9372191">Cummings is a Catholic priest, went on preaching anyway without the test oath and without being licensed by Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.759" offset="9406360">This Court struck it down and said a bill of attainder because the purpose of this legislation was to impose a punishment, a penalty, against a class of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.344" offset="9460799">The same -- on the same, the very same day, the Ex parte Garland decided by this Court, a lawyer not admitted -- admitted to this Court in 1860 who pleaded his own case and Congress had passed a law and saying that no one could be admitted to practice in the supreme Court unless they took a test oath all of the same as Cummings essentially and they have not supported the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.051" offset="9567587">Mr. Garland, a lawyer said the he could not take such oath because he had supported the south, he had been convicted, and he had been pardoned by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.477" offset="9601233">They struck it down said “bill of attainder,” this is a deprivation of -- it's a legislative act which imposes a penalty without a judicial trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.479" offset="9653269">Now, the next great case on the -- and which is the most comprehensive, it seems to me on the bill of attainder, is United States versus Lovett.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.750" offset="9686392">1943, there was a legislative act, passed in the middle of World War II, a period of great political excitement against -- directed against Mr. Dodd, Mr. Watson, and Robert Morss Lovett withholding their salaries, stricken down by this Court as a bill of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.495" offset="9777403">Now, the next case is that has been decided by this Court is A.C.A. versus Douds where it was said that that was not a bill of attainder, the Act of Congress which required a noncommunist affidavit from a labor union official was not a bill of attainder because it had a prospective effect and there was a choice given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.203" offset="9872175">Now with that background and assuming that this Court will agree that, as it has said before in contrary to Fong Haw Tan decided in 1893 on the -- on the Chinese exclusion legislation, that this is an exercise of a constitutional power, the power to regulate commerce and not upon an inherent sovereignty power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.198" offset="10004146">That was Mr. Gray -- Mr. Justice Gray's opinion in Fong Haw Tan decided in 1893, where he said that the -- this was an exercise of the inherent sovereignty power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.241" offset="10060361">Mr. Justice Brewer wrote a stinging dissent and he said, “No there is no end to this doctrine of inherent sovereign power because it's not spelled out in the Constitution,” no one knows it's in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.759" offset="10110412">Mr. Brewer -- Mr. Justice Brewer dissented as well as Mr. Chief Justice Fuller and there Mr. Justice Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.431" offset="10141132">Now, looked at in that part, here's an Act passed in 1950 during the Korean War and after the atom bomb, they (inaudible) political excitement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.593" offset="10181778">The Act is Internal Security Act, insofar as it relates to the declarations about the Communist Party in the United States speaks as of the present, 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.150" offset="10227963">It does not say that the Communist Party in the 1930s or anytime passed, why it speaks -- it is used in the present tense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.677" offset="10266102">Now, however the Act where it says that anytime after entry, a person who has been found to be a member is -- can be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.710" offset="10306226">It has been given a retroactive effect and it has been applied to this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.478" offset="10325243">The warrant of arrest upon which he was arrested said, the base upon evidence that the immigration department had and since entry and that he'd entered the country in 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.696" offset="10366203">They don't question so far as the knowledge of the person is concerned and the statute of limitation, there is none, no one could know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.904" offset="10394937">Well, what time the Government would claim that he had been a member of the Communist Party after 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.330" offset="10424717">Now with that-- with that setting in mind, the -- and assuming that the Congress has the power to regulate commerce then all of the provisions of the Constitution then applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.845" offset="10486784">This I say is punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.225" offset="10496293">This Court has said it is punishment for deportation for a person to be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.053" offset="10523564">It is -- it has a retroactive effect imposing a penalty for that which was innocent when done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.056" offset="10559613">Now, I recognize that this Court in the Harisiades case decided in 1952 in construing the Alien Registration Act of 1940 said that, “the ex post facto provision of the Constitution was limited to criminal punishment and therefore the ex post facto provision of the Constitution did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.723" offset="10646235">We think the premise upon which that has been made is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.011" offset="10667447">We think that the Harisiades decision should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.693" offset="10682180">Now, getting down further then to the question of whether or not the, this is a valid constitutional exercise of a -- of a specific provision with the Constitution respecting regulation of foreign commerce, we think that the -- that then -- that due process would require under the Fifth Amendment which says, persons that due process would require that -- if they proved by a proof that is equivalent to proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by clear, convincing an unequivocal evidence which is required in that in denaturalization proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.852" offset="10858768">Now, Mr. -- the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born has been permitted to file a brief amicus curiae cited as one of the citations there as a rather comprehensive and complete annual analysis of the various questions on deportation, entitled the constitutional status of lawfully admitted, permanent resident aliens published in Yale Law Journal of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.049" offset="10963571">There is an exhaustive analysis of every case that has been decided this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.500" offset="10985409">Now in the -- getting down to the case of Galvan versus Press, Mr. Justice Frankfurter in writing the opinion, impliedly recognized the -- a separate status for the person who has been admitted for lawful permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.640" offset="11065971">He occupies a status that is different from the illegal entry, the temporary resident, or the person who has been erroneously admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.212" offset="11112260">The cases we've cited in Galvan versus Press were Bugajewitz and Fong Haw Tan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.120" offset="11151862">Now the -- if we look at the case of Bugajewitz, it was really a case where the Congress had -- was controlling entry into this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.872" offset="11206823">They -- the Bugajewitz case, the only thing that was involved there was the conclusive presumption, established that a prostitute who became a prostitute within three years was deemed to be have been illegally admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.798" offset="11278608">Mr. Justice Holmes said that a three-year statute of limitations or a three-year basis to which we go back, formed a reasonable -- formed a reasonable basis to impose a condition to raise the -- to support the presumption and thus due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.726" offset="11354258">The -- I see that my time is about up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.761" offset="11366379">I submit Your Honors that this is a case of fundamental importance and I do want to say that the -- in respect to the question asked by one of the justices that the suspension of deportation was raised before the Ninth Circuit of Court of Appeals and this Court denied certiorari in December 1957, eight days after Rowoldt versus Perfetto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.001" offset="11459375">The -- when the Court denied certiorari at that time, we thought this question was precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.767" offset="11486438">It had been passed upon by the Federal District Court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and this Court had denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.270" offset="11516426">The present appeal arise from -- arises from an additional petition filed in the Federal District Court for injunctive relief and for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.296" offset="11560521">And that how -- that's how Communist gets before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.959" offset="11571179">We thought we were precluding from raising the question of suspension, denial of suspension of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.996" offset="11599391">The -- and there it – therefore it's not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.314" offset="11616632">Now, to summarize the -- it would appear to me that a proper construction of this Act that is involved here then would be based upon a constitutional exercise of power by the Congress of the United States to regulate commerce and not upon any ideas of inherent sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.633" offset="11733870">But then every other constitutional guarantee as this Court has said before applies to the person who is here all of the other constitutional guarantees apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.231" offset="11784338">And that a distinction can and should be made as to the person who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence than the illegal entrant, the temporary entrant, or the person who has been erroneously admitted, a separate status should -- should apply to that person.</text>

            <text syncTime="2978.296" offset="12016515">That the person is entitled to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3017.707" offset="12174190">The Court has said it's not criminal punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.966" offset="12187251">If this -- it is not -- it has not been thought that any citizen could be deprived of a jury trial if a penalty was to be imposed upon him of this kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="3104.636" offset="12521932">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.719" offset="12534262">It maybe helpful if I point out at the beginning of my argument that the original record in the case was simply, the record, which is labeled transcript of record, which contains almost none of the Immigration proceedings, but does contain the proceedings before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.219" offset="12596224">The briefs on both sides were written on the basis of this printed record alone and references were made to the unprinted immigration file, which is on file with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.465" offset="12641259">After the briefs were written, the supplemental transcript of record was printed at the instance of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.624" offset="12669889">I say this because the Court will not find a correspondence between the page references in the briefs to the immigration file and this printed record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.251" offset="12704371">Though I think the clerk has been helpful in putting folio references to help you discover the various pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.586" offset="12745749">I think I should also point out though, Mr. Peterson, adverted to it at the end of his argument that this is the second go round in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.718" offset="12782216">Petitioner filed a petition for habeas corpus and declaratory relief originally which was denied by Judge Solomon in Oregon after the denial of suspension of deportation and after the finding of deportability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.846" offset="12850761">That was taken to the Ninth Circuit which affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.835" offset="12862673">A petition for certiorari was filed on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.708" offset="12874167">This Court held that petition for certiorari until one week after the Rowoldt decision and then denied that petition for certiorari along with two or three others which were being held pending Rowoldt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.398" offset="12928920">The petitioner then applied, as has been indicated to the Board of Immigration Appeals for reconsideration on the basis of the Rowoldt decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.428" offset="12961102">The Board of Immigration Appeals did reconsider on the basis of the Rowoldt decision, reaffirmed its own original determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.658" offset="12994017">Petitioner then brought the present suit in the District Court in Oregon and it is that which is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.031" offset="13023483">Now, on that present suit, the petitioner asked for leave to proceed with oral evidence before the District Court in Oregon and Judge Solomon thought that that was improper as did the Government believe, but he allowed the petitioner to present evidence including the petitioner's own evidence before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.916" offset="13103000">After that hearing at which Judge Solomon said, “I do not believe the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.127" offset="13127868">I've been through the immigration file.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.057" offset="13135600">I do not believe this petitioner has testified before me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.774" offset="13150438">I do believe as did the administrative officials that the opposing evidence presented before the administrative tribunal was credible.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.964" offset="13183248">Judge Solomon reaffirmed his -- his conclusion that the petitioner was the deportable and that conclusion was affirmed again by the Court of Appeals and the case is now here on this petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.008" offset="13247404">Therefore, if I may summarize, the case has had three reviews before the Board of Immigration Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.246" offset="13276348">It had its first review after the original order of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.318" offset="13292648">It had its second review before the Board of Immigration Appeals after the denial suspension of deportation and it had its third review after the Rowoldt decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.773" offset="13330474">It has had two reviews before the District Court in Oregon, as I indicated, and it has two -- had two reviews before the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.687" offset="13374151">I say this because this Court has indicated perhaps mainly in other cases but also, I think, somewhat in immigration cases that it will pay attention to -- on a fair assessment of the record made by the lower courts in this field as well as in others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.063" offset="13439666">And it will not review de novo for itself on assessment of the record made by lower courts.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="3341.207" offset="13468191">As I understand that there were two hearings before Judge Solomon.</text>

            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="3344.222" offset="13480312">The first one did not entail any oral evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.954" offset="13491179">The first one did not, but it was a review on the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.225" offset="13504240">The second one did entail oral evidence and before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.289" offset="13524511">Now, turning first to the statutory and factual issues, it has been claimed here after the briefs were filed and so, we do not discuss it in our brief, it's claimed here on oral argument that the standard of deportability for a long time resident is different from the ordinary standard which is applicable in civil proceedings generally, that it is the higher standard applicable in criminal proceedings or in denaturalization or expatriation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.489" offset="13653347">We, of course, denied that this is so and we denied that is so because it is now some 70 years since Congress has been passing broad deportation statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.886" offset="13698905">And it is 70 years since Congress has dealt with the subject and since this Court and the lower courts have dealt with this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.004" offset="13723355">And we cannot find in any of this -- this legislation or in any of the decisions of this Court or the lower courts any such distinction between on -- with respect to deportability on the basis of the length of residence of the -- of the individual or on the basis of whether the deportation is related to original entry or whether it arises from some cause which later occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.525" offset="13829517">There are hosted decisions in the lower courts and a fair number of decisions in this Court, all of which apply the usual role of substantial evidence without exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.794" offset="13870582">In fact in some them cases -- cases written by Justice Brandeis and Justice Stone, the phrase has given some evidence to support the deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.003" offset="13907362">And in Bridges against Wixon to which reference was made, Mr. Justice Douglas for the Court also used that phrase some evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.202" offset="13940172">And the Court has never even intimated nor have any of the lower courts that a higher standard, the standard of denaturalization should apply in deportation cases nor has Congress in any of the statutes made any exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.786" offset="13998477">You will not find in this statute which is the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 or in any of the preceding statutes, any distinction such as has been suggested at the bar of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.685" offset="14046124">So, I think -- I think, I fairly stated when I say that until very recently and not until probably today before this Court has it been seriously urged that there is a separate standard for deportations of people who have been long resident in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.974" offset="14123238">Now, an effort is made to say that the prior rule was changed by the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act because the 1952 statute did spell out for the first time various procedural requirements which should be followed in the administrative proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.242" offset="14192306">It said that the Attorney General shall prescribe by regulation and certain requirements shall be followed and one of the requirements that was prescribed by the statute was that the -- an order of deportation should be entered only on substantial, probative, and reasonable evidence, substantial, probative and reasonable evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.548" offset="14269524">An effort is made to read into that language, a requirement of the higher standard to which counsel has referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.263" offset="14300453">We think that this is clearly an incorrect argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.217" offset="14320201">Not only was the prior law both in the statute and in the cases all the other way, but Congressmen (Inaudible) to prepare the 1952 statute when the Senate Committee set forth what it considered, the prior law to be, it said explicitly that the prior law was the general rule applicable in administrative and civil cases, the preponderance of the evidence standard, the substantial evidence standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.496" offset="14421347">There is no indication in the legislative history of any attempt to change that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.086" offset="14439737">The Senate and the house reports referred to the -- this -- this phrase substantial, probative, and reasonable evidence as simply an incorporation of the -- of the prior law and they indicate fairly that it means that a reviewing tribunal is not to overturn the finding simply because it disagrees with it, but if -- if the finding is based on substantial, probative, and reasonable evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.724" offset="14542242">But perhaps most persuasive of all, to my mind, is the fact that the Administrative Procedure Act which, of course, antedated the 1952 statute contains the similar standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.028" offset="14583515">It says, “reliable, probative and substantial evidence”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.009" offset="14599398">And this Court in the Marcello opinion of Mr. Justice Clark for that Court said quite clearly and explicitly, that the 1952 Immigration Standard is the same as the Administrative Procedure Act Standard of few prior years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.943" offset="14663137">And of course, there has never been any claim by anybody that the Administrative Procedure Act Standard adopts any special higher standard for administrative proceeding as generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.832" offset="14702738">Now, the standard which -- which counsel present to that Court clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence has been accepted and limited by the Court only to cases in which it has -- it has admitted that a man or woman once had citizenship and the Government claims that he has lost it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.884" offset="14786957">It is -- been limited to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.962" offset="14795212">That is when the Government is claiming when a man is either lost or should have his citizenship taken away and it is in that area only that that Court has accepted or established a clear, convincing, and unequivocal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.259" offset="14852368">In particular that Court has not accepted that standard where an alien claims that he's a citizen, where an alien claims, “I am a citizen”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.822" offset="14890611">The Court has accepted the preponderance of the evidence standard there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.442" offset="14905135">It is only when you have once been found to be a citizen, when you've once been found to be a citizen and the issue is whether you have lost that citizenship or have it -- had it taken away from you that the higher standard has been applied either by this Court or by the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.672" offset="14966053">So, we think that that there is nothing to the argument that -- that that 1952 statute established a higher standard and I think, it's correct to say that none of the lower courts since the 1952 Act went into effect have applied any higher standard regardless of the length of time where the resident was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.079" offset="15055705">And as my last word on that issue, I think, I should also say that the Court has applied the regular standard in many cases in which there was a long time residence by the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.957" offset="15103248">It itself is not indicated either in the Chinese deportation cases which some which involved people who have been here, a decade or two decades or in the later cases involving deportation which have come through the years that there was any difference depending on length of residence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3874.572" offset="15601664">He apparently tried again because the record does indicate that for the second or third time he applied in January 1942 and then it does indicate that in -- in 1946 his application for denaturalization was dismissed for wanted of prosecution on his part.</text>

            <text syncTime="4113.996" offset="16559313">It's also, I think, significant and I should point out to the Court that Wilmot testified that petitioner knew where he was going just as Wilmot who, of course, was party member himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="4142.849" offset="16674774">He did also only after the Board and Immigration Appeals had decided that he was deportable and he then applied for -- for suspension of deportation and on that suspension, he testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.308" offset="16736632">Now, as the Court knows from previous cases, suspension of deportation of a man who was been ordered deported for membership in the Communist Party requires an affirmative recommendation by the Attorney General to converse and then an affirmative concurrent resolution by both houses of Congress before suspension of deportation can be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.337" offset="16832763">And the statute also requires that to be eligible for suspension, you have to show that for 10 years after the status or Act which made you deportable occurred, you have been a person of good moral character and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.542" offset="16889501">Now, this has been interpreted by the Department of Justice and by the Congress to require in cases of suspension for subversive activity cases that the alien show that for 10 years he has made a break from the Communist Party that he has not been connected with it that he has been free of it that he is antagonistic to it, that he is not part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.975" offset="16983228">And it was in connection with that that petitioner testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.225" offset="17000260">And he's -- he denied that he had ever been a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.205" offset="17016142">He denied that he -- that he had known or seen Wilmot at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="4235.726" offset="17046235">He knew him but he couldn't -- he didn't know whether Knight was a party official or a party member.</text>

            <text syncTime="4245.761" offset="17086464">Petitioner's testimony with respect to his -- his views on communism appear really twice in the record one in the -- in the immigration file at pages 45 to 48, and the other in the -- in the judicial trial before Judge Solomon, on 56, and 61, and 62.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.196" offset="17176116">What they amount to is a denial -- a complete denial of membership in the Communist Party, except that he said he never knowingly attended party meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.183" offset="17212061">He apparently indicated that he had attended lots of meetings during this period of time and he -- his -- his statement was that he hadn't knowingly attended Communist Party meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4288.145" offset="17255946">He refused when requested to state his views of what communism was today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.748" offset="17274337">He said well he couldn't go into that, he didn't -- he didn't really know what was all about and it was on the basis of his -- of his statements as to -- as to the Communist Party in his views that he was denied suspension of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.332" offset="17336717">Because as I've indicated, the principal has been that you aren't granted suspension of deportation unless you have indicated affirmatively that you have made a break from the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.201" offset="17380185">And the conclusion of the administrative officials was that he had not at all shown that he made a break from the Communist Party that he had not indicated any -- shall I say dissatisfaction with the Communist Party though he had denied that he was ever a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.743" offset="17446327">And as I've pointed out, the District Judge, Judge Solomon, who was corporal part, may I note was the local counsel for De Jonge in the case of De Jonge against Oregon, Judge Solomon said although he indicated his -- his dissatisfaction with the law as -- as -- as a proper law, he said that he had to enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.605" offset="17545801">And he felt that in this case he was properly enforced against this petitioner that -- and he disbelieved the petitioner's denial of Communist Party membership and he said my credit with -- what the Government's witnesses said.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.931" offset="17599091">Now, you have then a testimony of live witnesses, cross-examined witnesses, credited by the administrative officials and by the District Court accepted by the Court of Appeals twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.275" offset="17664502">On the other hand, you have the petitioner's testimony character -- discredited by the administrative officials characterized as vague, evasive, unresponsive, discredited by the trial judge who did hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4405.740" offset="17726360">And in those circumstances, we feel, that as the Court has indicated in the past this is not its providence to reassess or reweigh the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4414.925" offset="17763035">It will accept the views of the -- of the courts below and the administrative officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="4420.903" offset="17786964">Now, was the membership which I have been describing, the type of membership which is covered by the deportation provisions of the 1952 statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="4431.288" offset="17828551">We think clearly that it was -- that it was the kind of meaningful political membership with which the Court was dealing in Galvan, in Harisiades, and in Rowoldt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.414" offset="17868988">He was cart (Inaudible), he was dues paying.</text>
            <text syncTime="4443.565" offset="17877661">He attended many close meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4445.804" offset="17886542">He was a top fraction, a person who attended this Northwest Plenum in Aberdeen, Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.919" offset="17911097">He was very active and I think I fairly state that they both testified that though they couldn't recall any theoretical discussions with him on the principles of Marxist-Leninist -- Marxism-Leninism, he was very active in discussion of party activities in the Portland area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4468.723" offset="17978284">Both Knight testified that and Wilmot testified that he was active in discussion with the party activities in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4476.164" offset="18008064">He was a member of the Executive Board of his party branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.376" offset="18028857">Both Knight and Wilmot testified though they testified they had never heard him advocate the overthrow of the Government by force and violence, they did testify that the -- they -- that all the activities of the party which they knew about it and which he was connected with were leading to an eventual revolt, and Wilmot testified that petitioner as Wilmot knew where he was going.</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.231" offset="18148289">The Court has indicated that it is permissible for administrative officials to draw inferences from silence and inferences for failures to explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4523.555" offset="18197608">If you put that together with the testimony, credited testimony of these witnesses and the type of activity which has been shown that this petitioner engaged in, we think he falls clearly within the -- the rules laid down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4547.257" offset="18292381">He was not a minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.617" offset="18292276">There are certain exceptions which have been read by statute and initial decision into the concept of the term membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.674" offset="18298023">He was not a communist by operation of law which of course could not occur in the United States and unlike Rowoldt, there is no indication that he was communist to obtain the necessities of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.213" offset="18348178">Rowoldt was a man who was deported solely on the basis of his own testimony which that majority of the Court thought was not clear enough to indicate that he had any political connection with the Communist Party, that he wasn't a member of the Communist Party as he said to -- for -- for bread and food, this is a different type of man.</text>
