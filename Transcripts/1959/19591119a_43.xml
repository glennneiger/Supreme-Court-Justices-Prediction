            <text syncTime="27.087" offset="211675">-- may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.892" offset="222960">The -- this case presents for consideration of the Court, two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.286" offset="256502">One involves the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment under the facts in this case and the other involves the application of the Statute of Limitations in criminal conspiracy cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.171" offset="356080">The -- briefly the -- with respect to the first issue, the record's facts are that the petitioner was indicted with another one named Seijas for conspiracy to violate the Section 145 of the Internal Revenue Code, that is that conspiracy to attempt to evade the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.802" offset="506546">The precise method of attempted evasion was described in two -- four subsections; one, merely alleges that they conspired to evade without designating or describing any means by which they would attempt to do so and the second subdivision (d) describes a sort of a hybrid violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.980" offset="663280">It's – it alleges that they conspired to evade -- to violate Section 145 (b), the tax evasion statute and 1001 of the Criminal Code, the false statement statute, conjunctively.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.124" offset="771845">And -- but they conspired to do so by making false statements and presenting false records to revenue officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.459" offset="821164">Now, the -- the defendant was tried alone on this conspiracy charge and was found guilty and sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.124" offset="891904">He appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit where the conviction was reversed with directions to enter a judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.238" offset="960345">And that was predicated upon the defense which the petitioner urged throughout the case that the case was barred -- prosecution was barred by the Statute of Limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.961" offset="1023248">The -- the determination of that question as the case developed and I will describe it a little more in detail later, briefly it turned upon the question whether there existed in the case evidence of the subsidiary conspiracy to -- to -- which would prolong the operation of the Statute of Limitations of the character that had been described in the Krulewitch and Grunewald cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.704" offset="1134216">And the Court of Appeals determined that there was no evidence of the character and type of agreement that was found necessary to prolong the Statute of Limitations in those two cases and consequently the -- directed the judgment of acquittal, said that the -- that the -- it was error to submit the case to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.836" offset="1262738">Now, after that decision was rendered, the Government filed what it denominated a petition for a rehearing, but which we, the petitioner contends, was not a petition for a rehearing in legal contemplation, although so denominated that it presented to the Court a -- new issues for determination upon which it thought they should have another trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.606" offset="1409755">It presented a -- an issue which they called an alternative theory which it said could have been submitted to the jury and the case would have been tried upon that alternative theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.961" offset="1467225">And they did not challenge the correctness of the one conclusion or the one issue which the Court of Appeals decided, namely that there was no evidence to sustain the conviction on the theory upon which the case was tried and submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.246" offset="1544338">They didn't ask that the reversal shall be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.786" offset="1558549">It only asked that instead of directing the judgment of acquittal, that the opinion should be modified to direct a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.582" offset="1613720">And the Court of Appeals, in its modifying opinion, merely determined that there was evidence on the record which would have sustained this so-called alternative theory and the case might have been tried on that alternative theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.004" offset="1715388">That was the language of the modification opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.586" offset="1729703">Your Honor will find it at -- in the record at page 1936 to 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.017" offset="1807444">The Court concluded and said, “It now appears to us that the case might have been tried upon this alternative theory, namely, that the conspiracy continued past the filing of the returns for the purpose of protecting the tax -- taxpayers from tax prosecution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="443.107" offset="1875780">Now, it -- the Court did not say that it was at the -- that they found that it had -- was an error in his formal conclusion that there was lack of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.413" offset="1924995">It didn't -- that they had -- no contention was made on that respect and it didn't make such a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.306" offset="1952580">And this new theory was one that was presented to the Court of Appeals for the first time in this petition which they call the petition for a new trial, but which -- before a rehearing, but which we say is an original petition for a new trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="492.056" offset="2071594">Yes, we say in legal effect it was a -- an original proceeding in the Court of Appeals and I say it was a legal effect of that as such an original proceeding, because the case was not tried on this so-called alternative theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.273" offset="2152469">The Government took no exceptions to the theory upon which the case was submitted to the jury, didn't object to those -- to that theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.823" offset="2190712">It did not request submission to the jury of any instructions predicated on this alternative theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.091" offset="2243688">And so, there was nothing for the court -- the District Court to pass upon in connection with this question of the availability or nonavailability of an alternative theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="2659.649" offset="10741948">We say -- but we say that the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to entertain that new phase either in its original opinion or under the petition for rehearing, because it was not, in legal effect, a petition for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.702" offset="10810180">Our view is and -- that if whenever you in -- present to the appellate court entirely new issue, which was not ruled upon in the court below, it's no longer – it's not a court of review, being asked to try a case de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.671" offset="10902026">That is what it -- what it amounts to and that particularly (Inaudible) in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.796" offset="10938598">Now -- now, the -- they're -- in the further exemplifications that I did that we call attention to the fact that the federal rules of criminal procedure expressly prohibit the reexamination of the giving of instructions or the failure to give instructions unless they are brought to the attention of the Court and exception taken and if in the case of failure to give instructions, there is an absence of request for submission, that rule precludes review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.990" offset="11203375">The District Court could not have reviewed its instructions, its failure to give instructions involving the alternative theory and the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction under this rule to review the -- the failure to give instructions embodying theory even though there'd be evidence to sustain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.769" offset="11378500">Now, we submit -- of the -- here correct rule of what is laid down on the -- on the only case that directly passed upon this subject was a case in the Ninth Circuit, the Corn case as to what power the Court of Appeals has upon reversal, whether to direct an acquittal or to -- or to direct a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.152" offset="11567940">Whether there's that discretionary power in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.556" offset="11581628">Now, that Court held squarely that there was no discretion in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.568" offset="11609631">That if the defendant was entitled at the close of the Government's -- of the entire case to a judgment of acquittal, that became vested right, an accrued right that it had and it can't -- couldn't be taken away from unconstitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.771" offset="11690506">And therefore, when the Court of Appeals reverses on the ground that there was no evidence warranting submission of the case to the jury, if that -- it could do noting else, but to give him the same relief and the same kind of judgment that he was entitled to receive at the hands of the District Court in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.674" offset="11770023">That was his accrued right as the courts put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.503" offset="11781413">Now, the court in that case, gave a good deal of consideration to the question that examines the authorities at length and came to that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.593" offset="11829791">And I haven't found any case in which the force of the reasoning employed has ever been has offset -- the value that court as -- as precedent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3073.156" offset="12396022">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.184" offset="12408142">I should like to take a few minutes to settle once and for all, the chronology here of this case and to demonstrate, without any doubt, that from the very beginning, from the indictment all the way through the case, the Government took the position in line with the so-called alternative theory upheld by this Court in Grunewald, namely, a continuing conspiracy on what this Court called in adopting the Second Circuit that is a dissent in the Second Circuit's characterization, namely, the installment theory of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.663" offset="12641991">The Government did not submit this case that is the indictment was not drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.066" offset="12675636">The case was not argued to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.969" offset="12695280">The evidence was not so framed on the subsidiary conspiracy theory that this Court struck down in -- in Grunewald.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.378" offset="12772916">Now, to pursue that further, the indictment charged these two individuals with conspiring first to the attempt to evade the taxes of one of the conspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.434" offset="12881063">Second, it charged a violation of the evasion statute 145 (b) and the false statement statute, by means of making false statements in order to cover up the income of Seijas, one of the conspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.766" offset="12994435">It then alleged 33 overt acts pursuant to the conspiracy, seven of which occurred within six years of the returning of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.966" offset="13071235">So that's the first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.980" offset="13079280">The indictment did not depend upon a subsidiary conspiracy theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.317" offset="13124629">Now the evidence; just briefly to review the overt acts that were established here within the six-year period before indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.531" offset="13189517">The Government -- that is the indictment alleges four acts 24, 26, 29 and 30, which consists in a revenue agent visiting both of these conspirators who had a joint office and who ran these pinball machine out of partnerships and that agent during the period 1948, made numerous visits to that office, talked to both conspirators, discussed various phases of the -- the taxes and the taxes or rather, and the income of the four pinball partnerships operated by the -- this business and submitted two reports which resulted in minor deficiencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.849" offset="13450742">In the course of that investigation, they were -- the agent asked for and was given books which were false that namely, they did not disclose the true income of the four pinball partnerships and the evidence is uncontradicted in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.327" offset="13560665">Again, in 1931, I mean in -- I beg your pardon, overt act 31, in 1951, at the request of the agent's Seijas had prepared and that was given to Seijas and he in time, turned it over to the revenue agents, a net worth statement, which showed no additional income for the period, 1942 through 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.786" offset="13722520">That is no unreported income, whereas in truth and in fact, the evidence later established that there was at least $86,000 that was not included in those books, neither was it included in the returns of Seijas, that's overt act 31.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.339" offset="13828681">Overt act 32 and 33, maybe looked together, consisting of statements made by Seijas in the year 1952, January, the lower year before this indictment was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.986" offset="13935365">Those statements, one of them in effect, was that Seijas believed that he had reported all of his income from the year of 19 -- the year of 1942 through 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.352" offset="14000776">The other statement was that in relation to $165,000 shown on this net worth statement, that he, Seijas, had no knowledge where that money came from, but notwithstanding the fact that in the early 1953, which as we say, was the time when this conspiracy was abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.281" offset="14112475">Seijas came to the agents and said that $165,000 belongs in 1942 through 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.659" offset="14170049">So, the evidence was not submitted on the theory of a -- of a subsidiary conspiracy namely a conspiracy to conceal a conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="4924.147" offset="19799960">Particularly as I pointed out a while ago on bottom of page 5, the next to the last paragraph that is in the footnote says, “Third and goes on to point out that the jury must find that one -- one or more the conspirators committed an act, an overt act or action within a period of six years prior to the following indictment herein, in furtherance of the conspiracy and during its continuance to accomplish the object, namely, attempted evasion of the tax liability of Seijas.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.345" offset="19964740">Now, that clearly is charging a continuing conspiracy to accomplish the original objective of the conspiracy, not a conspiracy to conceal a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4985.267" offset="20044466">I should also like to say a few words on the point that we emphatically disagree with the petitioner's statement that the Court of Appeals, when it granted the petitioner's original request and remanded the case for judgment of acquittal, that the Court of Appeals based that decision on the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5023.924" offset="20199111">Your Honors please, on page 1934 and 1935 of the record, the Court of Appeals after a lengthy discussion of the two theories in Grunewald and pointing out that -- that the subsidiary conspiracy to conceal a conspiracy is invalid, ends up by saying, “Upon the authority of this decision, namely, Grunewald of the Supreme Court, we hold that it was error to permit the case to go to the jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5068.716" offset="20378206">Furthermore on its -- in its -- among other places, in its third opinion on record 1940, the Court emphatically says, “Denies that it had taken that initial action on the basis of insufficiency of evidence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.654" offset="20477994">It pointed out that it took that action because it didn't understand originally that the Government was relying on the continuing conspiracy theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5122.517" offset="20593455">It's the Government's position that -- that -- but for this single item, namely, the instruction to the jury on the theory that there was a -- there had to be a conspiracy to conceal a conspiracy, had that instruction not have been injected into the record by this petitioner, that this case would come to this Court with a flawless record that would support the conviction and we see no distinction otherwise, between this case and Grunewald.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.818" offset="20822601">And there's no reason, it's apparent that this petitioner should be given any different treatment than was given to Grunewald, because there was a -- it's the same confusion as to -- that may have been created in the minds of the jury as to which theory was the proper one.</text>

            <text syncTime="5892.541" offset="23673501">Now, those presented assignments of error relating to errors in -- in admission of evidence and so on, which would warrant the reversal with a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5904.662" offset="23721984">We carefully segregated, so we would not be construed as having waived our demand for a judgment of acquittal, if we are sustained in our contention that the evidence was insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="5921.401" offset="23788962">We took our precaution and in the cases that we cite in our brief governing this question of waiver, we call attention to the Green case in which the Court has said and rejected the contention that the taking of an appeal in and off itself is a waiver of the constitutional protection and throws the case open at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="5949.005" offset="23899408">That called -- this Court called attention to Justice Holmes' statement in which he said that a waiver must be knowingly and intentionally made that can't be inferred, that there's a strong presumption against waiver of a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5968.970" offset="23979238">It called attention to Justice McKenna's statement to say in effect, so, we can see no reason of why we should be deemed to have the waived a -- the constitutional protection because we exercise the perfectly lawful right to appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="6024.132" offset="24199920">We cite it at page 15 of our reply brief on which the Court construed what was formally 206 Section 269 of the Judicial Code, which is roughly called the harmless error statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6040.914" offset="24267003">It's a discretionary statute which gives the courts power to disregard harmless error and coming to an ultimate conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6051.369" offset="24308799">And it's a -- in that respect, it's similar in its operation to Section 2106 of the Judicial Code which is relied on here by the Government as to the kind of relief that the appellate court can give.</text>
            <text syncTime="6066.178" offset="24368044">The Court -- this Court said that in construing that statute while it confers discretion, there must be no departure from a constitutional norm.</text>
