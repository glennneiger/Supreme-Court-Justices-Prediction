            <text syncTime="14.447" offset="161207">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.758" offset="174373">This is a little more difficult case than the one which we have just been through, a little more difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.997" offset="211362">And the difficulty is two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.299" offset="228603">One is in the nature of the grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.542" offset="241560">Now, this is the kind of grievance which -- that seems to raise hackles among management people, arbitrators, creates more confusion than I think any other single type of grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.582" offset="301746">And also the -- there is some language in the arbitration agreement which does not appear in the usual or standard form of arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.337" offset="340720">We think that for the same reasons which we set forward in the first case, the American Manufacturing, the Court should come to the result here.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.077" offset="371649">But it will take us a little more time I think to dispose of these difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.962" offset="391189">Now, to the facts, in this case, there was a contract, again, executed in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.651" offset="433925">The Company is the Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Company which operates a barge line.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.041" offset="455555">It's a wholly owned subsidiary of United States Steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.770" offset="478438">It has a terminal at Chickasaw, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.808" offset="494634">The unit involved and this is important as it bears on the grievance, the nature of the grievance, was not a production unit in the usual manufacturing established but a maintenance unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.957" offset="535176">This was a unit and the contract covered people whose job was to repair these barges as they came into the terminal from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.595" offset="585749">In 1958, the union filed a grievance essentially claiming that what the Company was doing was having its repair work done instead of at its own terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.589" offset="645726">At other terminals nearby, contracting out, it's the word it used, to work to other employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.051" offset="683551">And that this violated the agreement constituted, they said “a partial lockout,” it was the word of the grievance, because there were people who were laid off by Warrior &amp; Gulf who did this kind of work, who could do this kind of work and who had in fact done this kind of work until the Company selected to have someone else do the work instead of -- of the employees of the collective bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.696" offset="794206">The employer of the Company refused to arbitrate the grievance and a lawsuit was filed asking that the grievance be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.558" offset="837569">Let me say a word about the grievance because this applies to both cases and indeed in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.569" offset="853661">I will not treat the grievance the actual language of grievance as defining the scope of the contract claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.104" offset="883754">Now, the Court of Appeals, even the dissenting judge treated it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.708" offset="906219">Grievances in the nature as being appalled by a workman not by staff representative the union usually, that work.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.575" offset="937671">They're certainly aren't to be construed with the strictness which under the federal rules even the complaints drafted by lawyers no longer are treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.035" offset="979466">And there's no provision for amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.709" offset="986258">And grievance really is just the starting paper which starts it off, the claims are defined and refined as the grievance procedure goes along.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.241" offset="1020322">In any case they filed a grievance saying that the Company had violated the agreement by contracting out this work.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.610" offset="1049788">The Company refused to arbitrate and it went to the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.726" offset="1278307">“Should differences arise between the Company and the Union or its members employed by the Company as to the meaning and application of the provisions of this Agreement, or should any local trouble of any kind arise, there shall be no suspension of work on account of such differences but an earnest effort shall be made to settle such differences immediately in the following manner.”</text>
            <text syncTime="311.047" offset="1347584">And then you go through the grievance procedure with the ascending steps, all arbitration at the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.381" offset="1364929">But before all that is the following introductory paragraph which is one of the two difficulties in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.101" offset="1387813">“Issues which conflict with any Federal statute in its application as established by Court procedure or matters which are strictly a function of management shall not be subject to arbitration under this section.”</text>
            <text syncTime="336.816" offset="1450611">And what we have in these contract is a larger than usual grievance and arbitration specification which covers both questions of meaning and application and any local trouble of any kind in addition plus a limitation saying in the words which I've quoted which at least insofar as relevant here, appears, at least in our view and all I anticipate by argument, to limit the arbitrator to questions of what we think are questions of meaning and application of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.456" offset="1577148">But this is one of the issues in the case as the proper construction of that language.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.814" offset="1702640">And more importantly -- now I think we would say, and again I'm anticipating here, that I might as well get this clearly out as really the essential part of this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.658" offset="1754049">Every grievance and I think it is most important to recognize, every grievance claimed against action which is taken by management as a matter of a function of management.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.311" offset="1836596">Management under this contract as a management rights clause, some contracts do, some contracts don't, it doesn't make really much difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.432" offset="1869093">Management hires, fires, pays the people, directs the working force and schedules the workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.783" offset="1890513">That's the management's function.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.433" offset="1897096">It's not only its rights, its -- its obligation, it's its duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.556" offset="1913605">A management obviously has the right lay off employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.084" offset="1927711">The only question in every grievance is whether a management which should always be active in exercising its function of directing the working forces, scheduling the employees, paying them has in doing that violated some provision expressed or implied in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.763" offset="2010467">If it lays off A instead of B, the argument which a grievant -- A says, “I shouldn't have been laid off, B should have been laid off.”</text>
            <text syncTime="485.744" offset="2046307">Obviously, management is exercising its function of managing in laying off a man.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.421" offset="2061040">As a matter of fact, in picking the one to be laid off in first place, that's management's job.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.817" offset="2078595">It makes the determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.974" offset="2083297">It reads the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.432" offset="2089148">It determines what it's going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.375" offset="2100851">In the nature of the grievance procedure, this consultative system ending up in arbitration is that you then determine whether a management which acted the first place, acted in accordance with the other provisions of the agreement in exercising management's function.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.956" offset="2163231">Now, we read this provision which says that you don't arbitrate things which are strictly a function of management as meaning strictly, i.e. purely a function of management.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="528.585" stopTime="530.931">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="528.585" offset="2217671">Meaning not covered by any other provision of the agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="535.519" offset="2245465">It comes down to in the end very much at -- and it's necessary because you have a broader grievance procedure which allows grievances on any local trouble whether or not related to the agreement to be handled in the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.031" offset="2299486">This is not a limited grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.073" offset="2307636">You can file a grievance which says, “We don't think the Company ought to install this new machinery.”</text>
            <text syncTime="559.488" offset="2341282">And under this grievance procedure that must be processed if there's trouble about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.567" offset="2365628">We don't claim that you don't have any contract right to do it but we'll just then will think you ought to.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.935" offset="2383078">Or we think that Joe Jones is the foreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.825" offset="2390706">He's a mean and nasty man.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.749" offset="2398333">We think the Company ought to fire Joe Jones as the foreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.235" offset="2416306">And there's problem about Joe Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.658" offset="2426023">Under this agreement, that is the local trouble and you go through the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.454" offset="2445145">This is the finding of fact in the United States Steel contract which I gave Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.815" offset="2458624">We permit that up to a certain stage of the grievance, any complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.934" offset="2471058">We defined there grievance as a -- a complaint of violation in the agreement but complaints are much broader than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.396" offset="2500942">Now, having given that broader scope to the grievance procedure, covering matters which relate to the agreement, right of claims of violation in the agreement, the parties had to, we assume in the hypothetical intent which we always do here as you do when you interpret legislation, find out what they meant in this first paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.078" offset="2579728">And when they say that a matter which strictly a function of management is a matter in which management -- there's no claim that management's rights are limited by the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.914" offset="2619016">In the Joe Jones case, I don't claim that management has got a -- employ a foreman who's pleasant to the workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.973" offset="2647228">In the (Inaudible) case, I talked about in the previous case.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.507" offset="2657364">There are lots of grievances like that and they say, “Now, those matters are strictly a function of management.”</text>

            <text syncTime="652.548" offset="2713579">Precisely our position is that this arbitration provision just like the one in American Manufacturing, though differently phrased, intends to limit the arbitrator to the determination of questions of interpretation and application of the agreement, whether or not the Company has violated the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.027" offset="2787453">And when you raise a question like that, you are not in the areas which are strictly a function of management.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.818" offset="2810650">You are in the areas in which there is dispute as to whether management's rights are not limited -- whether management rights are limited.</text>

            <text syncTime="845.143" offset="3483982">While the strike was in progress, the company refused to meet with the union and the National Labor Relations Board issued unfair labor practice charges and found the company guilty of a violation of the duty to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.205" offset="3532152">And the question came up to the Sixth Circuit on the question of enforcement of that order.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.979" offset="3575306">And since it was arbitrable, the companies had no duty to bargain on that question with the union because it had channeled the bargaining as it were into the grievance procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="889.479" offset="3661302">And I will read from the -- the grievance procedure in the Timken Roller Bearing case which said, “Should differences arise between the Company and the Union”, and I'm reading from 161 F.2d 951, “as to the meaning and application of the provisions of this agreement or should any local trouble of any kind arise in the plant, there shall be no suspension of work on account of such differences but an earnest effort shall be made to -- to the settle such differences properly in the matter here and after outlined.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1070.734" offset="4386356">They sought that cause and United States Steel didn't get it and they sought it here and didn't get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.215" offset="4408195">Now, the fact that the Company's -- the union sought such a clause was relied on both in the District Court and In the Court of Appeals to argue that the grievance here was not arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.209" offset="4456260">I want to make several points in connection with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.269" offset="4464410">First of all, I think unlike contract interpretation where proposals which parties make to each other commercial contracts may be relevant and there's no damage done to the process by bringing in proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.427" offset="4513102">Actually, many arbitrators will refuse to hear proposals which the parties have made with others for a very good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.187" offset="4548106">If parties know that when they make a proposal to deal explicitly with the subject which they think or may have an argument has already dealt with the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.544" offset="4589589">And that was a proposal -- will be used in the arbitration process thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.687" offset="4610069">You place a large rulebook in the -- in the conduct of successful collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.651" offset="4637968">Each party is playing it very close to the bets, it can't be frank and say what it wants because if it is frank, it's going to get cut in an arbitration proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.460" offset="4673181">For that reason, most arbitrators, many arbitrators will take with great deal of reluctance evidence as to proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.366" offset="4696795">As a matter fact, in the agreement, for the first time in the agreement just concluded in the basic steel industry because there were such a public cure about the local working conditions issue, the work rules dispute this, specifically provided what we have always done in practice that neither party shall make any reference to any proposals which the other party had made during the course of the negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.516" offset="4777462">But that's an arbitrator not a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.379" offset="4788851">Now, if we assume that the Court is in the position of an arbitrator, an assumption which I'm willing to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.988" offset="4811316">But if you assume it is and as -- because I think the course of negotiations, if it does come in before the arbitrator, bears on the question of the proper interpretation and application of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.800" offset="4858546">You would construe the agreement in the light of the proposals which the parties had made to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.677" offset="4878085">If you want to construe it in those terms and if you want to get in on that basis, my answer to the District Court's and the Court of Appeals' reliance on the 1956 proposals of this -- what the union proposed in 1956 was a bar on all contracting out of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.119" offset="4951855">In this grievance, I think it ought to be made perfectly clear in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.947" offset="4967111">We do not contend that the contracting out of work is not a management function.</text>

            <text syncTime="3305.936" offset="13327130">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.838" offset="13354715">I think it was in the decision of this Court in the Jones and Lachman case upholding the Wagner Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.485" offset="13385331">That it was said that it would be to ignore the plainest facts of our industrial life to hold that manufacturing was not an interstate commerce affecting interstate commerce or something to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.961" offset="13447189">And I would like to borrow that language to point to the situation in which the Company found itself in this case, the plainest facts of our industrial life in the negotiation of labor agreements, or that a union is striving to take and a company is striving to hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.074" offset="13579682">It's important to recognize that in the situation which we have before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.756" offset="13614373">What was the company striving to hold here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.429" offset="13633076">For 18 years from its inception in 1940, it had exercised the practice of contracting out work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.314" offset="13692635">During the last six years of that period up to the time of this controversy in 1958, it had contracts at least two, possibly several, record shows only two with this union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.913" offset="13763062">In the course of which, it had continued this practice of contracting out work against the vigorous opposition of the union during the negotiation of those contracts and against the vigorous silence of the union during the operation of those contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.079" offset="13883643">Now, the fact that the naked contract does not give us the right to contract our this work, only means that in the plainest facts of our industrial life, it is rare that a company can afford to take the years of shutdown due to strikes in order to obtain the negative provisions of a contract which be -- would be necessary in order to change the language of this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.356" offset="14064828">The union asked for affirmative provisions and for negative provisions negatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.195" offset="14092204">The Company tries to keep out of the contract, things which will change its practices which have been accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.016" offset="14127417">Everything that the union and the Company did, all of its objective conduct throughout the period involved here and in connection with the handling and administration of this arbitration agreement which is all we're talking about here, this arbitration agreement, pointed to a pronounced acceptance by both sides of the fact that so far as contracting out work was concerned, it was an untouchable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.485" offset="14261269">The union couldn't touch it and the arbitrator couldn't touch it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.780" offset="14290526">Now, this is not a shipyard, about which we are talking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.364" offset="14312782">This is a transportation company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.905" offset="14326993">The maintenance and repair of its vessels and barges is and always has been only incidental to its business up until the time that World War II took away its equipment and made it necessary that it reequip its operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.235" offset="14420302">It had the same type of skeleton force which it now has and to which it reverted after it had completed a special period of operations which due to the nature of the vessels which had been built under its own direction and engineering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.060" offset="14491564">And due to the mistakes which had been made, calling for repowering and important changes, had called for a larger work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.174" offset="14536077">The record makes it clear that at no time during the 18 years including the six years in which the Company and the union had these contracts has there been any deviation from the practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.012" offset="14607444">The Company laid off employees before it had the contracts with the union while contracting out work.</text>

            <text syncTime="3719.779" offset="14982457">This yard was a small yard with very limited facilities and it had to give a certain amount of its business to the shipyards for the very practical reason in addition to the economy of not having to buy all its equipment for itself for the very practical reason that if it didn't give a steady flow of work in his other shipyards, they wouldn't do the work which they alone could do when the time came and there when needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.792" offset="15090500">Now, the practice as I say of contracting out continued unbroken and -- and that the record shows conclusively in exactly the same fashion as it always had been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.460" offset="15177226">Moreover, both before and after the contracts with the union, the company laid off the employees while continuing to contract out work without complaint by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.427" offset="15229053">In this particular case, it was almost two years after the grieving employees had been laid off, and after the last contract had been signed before the union or the employees filed its grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.153" offset="15296031">So when the matter was presented to the Court, and the Court conceived as it did that it had the responsibility under Section 301 to determine whether this was an arbitrable issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.880" offset="15378892">Whether the parties had contracted to submit this issue to arbitration, and in that respect, I disagree with Mr. Feller in response to the question asked by Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.580" offset="15445661">When the Court was asked to decide whether this issue violated the promise to arbitrate and it conceived its duty to decide that under Section 301, it decided it in the purest form of contract interpretation, one which has been recognized and accepted by our courts to this day and on a very broad and uniform basis.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel Lang</label>
            <text syncTime="3902.764" offset="15714408">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.100" offset="15727783">Now frankly, the -- the evidence in this case is overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.358" offset="15776789">It's overwhelming because -- and I may be wrong again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.250" offset="15796328">Up until a few month -- a few minutes ago, I don't think that Mr. Feller acknowledged what he did acknowledge at that time that it was for the arbitrator to decide arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.273" offset="15856515">Now, nowhere in the record does it appear, or rather that be -- it was for the Court to determine arbitrability, I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.875" offset="15882846">Nowhere does it appear explicitly in the record that the union took the position that it was for the arbitrator to decide arbitrability but I challenge anyone to read the brief filed in this case by the petitioner without reaching the conclusion that his argument is that only the arbitrator may determine arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.207" offset="15984201">And the reason that that is clearly shown, the proof in the pudding is the fact that the union walked into the District Court, moved for summary judgment, sat down and did not make any attempt in this record, not one iota of attempt to prove what the parties had agreed to but instead tried to throw the smokescreen of the merit idea into the case by itself going into the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.973" offset="16115231">Now, it is important that I distinguish at this point between the merits in the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.588" offset="16153684">The merits that we are talking about and to which we address ourselves and on which the Court made its finding are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.211" offset="16192240">Number one, there's nothing in the contact that prohibits subcontracting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.870" offset="16214810">That's an indication of something why, why isn't there anything in the contract that doesn't refer to contracting out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.916" offset="16251068">Number two, because the parties have talked about it and decided and agreed that they shall not interfere with the Company's right to contract out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.640" offset="16285968">Number four, because there is great silence throughout the administration of these contracts when the Company exercises this practice of contracting out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4059.471" offset="16341243">And number five, because management rights mean something here and I want to speak to that subject for a while too.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.041" offset="16387532">In other words, what we wanted to do when we went into the merits of the issue of the controversy was to show what the parties by their objective conduct had done and said, and themselves said they understood the contract to mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.525" offset="16469452">But when the union put on its case, it didn't want to go into all that because it contended as it clearly does in its brief here that any claim makes the matter arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.624" offset="16525876">Therefore, we don't have to go into the question of whether or not the party has exhibited their intentions or understanding as to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.587" offset="16569762">They -- instead of assuming the burden which I think I heard Mr. Feller admit that he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.810" offset="16602572">Instead of assuming the burden of proving to the Court's satisfaction that this issue was arbitrable, it went into the merits of the grievance, the second kind of merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.886" offset="16654921">Now, what are those merits?</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.975" offset="16663280">Those merits are, and here is all the testimony -- oh exclusively the testimony of the -- of the union that Joe Smith had done work on the bottoms at Warrior &amp; Gulf's yard and he also had done work on the bottoms at the Harrison Brothers yard, the company to which the company had contracted out some work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.917" offset="16751052">And he could do work at the Warrior &amp; Gulf yard which he also did at the Harrison Brothers Yard, and that a foreman who came around and -- and laid out their work in the Warrior &amp; Gulf yard also went around and marked with the yellow chalk the work to be done at the Harrison Brothers yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.564" offset="16829628">Therefore, what we were doing was, we were giving to Harrison Brothers work which these laid-off employees could do in our own yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.948" offset="16867140">Now, that is a horse of an entirely different color.</text>
            <text syncTime="4194.823" offset="16882709">Those are the merits of the grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.301" offset="16892531">Those are the things which the arbitrator will decide if Your Honors decide that this case shall go to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.203" offset="16940178">We say the management rights clause means something.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.260" offset="16952404">Mr. Feller says it means nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.183" offset="16964106">Mr Feller says you could leave that out of the contract and on this -- and to this extent we agree with him because management always has the right to exercise management rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.113" offset="17011858">He interprets that to mean that management has the right to fire a man.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.139" offset="17035891">And the union has the right to grieve about the firing of that man.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.488" offset="17053341">Management has the right to cut the hours of work and the union has the right to file a grievance about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.819" offset="17082598">But there's one thing wrong with that idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.807" offset="17106631">This management rights clause contain the express provision that management's rights shall be not arbitrable, not subject to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.917" offset="17159084">Now, that must mean something.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.612" offset="17169847">That can't merely mean that management having the right to fire a man, the union having a right to grieve that the fact of firing shall not be arbitrable but the justification for the firing shall not be -- shall -- shall be arbitrable where the fact of firing shall not be arbitrable but the justification for the firing shall be arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4289.737" offset="17262320">You can't mean that, it would be a waste of language.</text>

            <text syncTime="4308.927" offset="17339120">So we say that -- that that language means something and that the Court had the right to construe it along with the rest of the language of the arbitration agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.425" offset="17389066">We also think it is quite important to note the order in which these provisions appear in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.480" offset="17417279">The first thing that it said is, “Management rights shall not be arbitrable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4336.723" offset="17450297">And then it says “Differences and as to the meaning and application of the contract shall be arbitrable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4343.501" offset="17477360">Now, what does this mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.217" offset="17484257">What does this “management right shall not be arbitrable” mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.644" offset="17501915">I don't think anyone will disagree that there has been a lot of confusion about the meaning of the term management rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.478" offset="17541308">That there has been a lot of difference of opinion between management people as to whether they ought to put a management rights provision into a contract or not to put one in a contract and the main area of disagreement is over whether the failure to cover everything means that they have thereby given up some things which they really had.</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.212" offset="17632214">But uniformly, students, management and labor people agree that the management rights clause is there for the purpose of holding -- holding on to the practices which they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4399.742" offset="17702327">We are reserving, retaining our rights in our practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4406.470" offset="17729285">And that is so well accepted in the philosophy of management people in any rate and we have cited the (Inaudible) in our brief to that effect and also some management -- American Management Association and so on authorities to that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.191" offset="17804100">That in seeking to put in language which again is inartistic, the reservation from arbitration of those practices in which they have been engaged, they sometimes get this provision which we report doesn't have to get in our contract that those management rights shall not be arbitrable.</text>

            <text syncTime="4735.282" offset="19044498">Now, if the management knows, and this addresses itself to the question of public policy because we very strongly feel that it will advance the cause of arbitration if the Court decides to affirm the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.181" offset="19092146">For this reason, management is very touchy and sensitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.966" offset="19107192">Professor Cox has pointed that out about arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.515" offset="19121403">There is no secret of the fact that management is wary and distrustful of arbitration and the reasons are -- are evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.939" offset="19163094">The fact is that if management is told in a situation of this kind, you -- the only way to protect yourself, and we say that management did everything it possible could to get this interpretation into the agreement and into the life of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4782.492" offset="19233311">That if -- if the management has told that in this type of case it has no protection that an arbitrator can come along and decide on the basis of an interpretation of seniority clause that it had no right to contract out this work or any part of it and management is going to be told that it has got to get into the contract, something to further limit arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="5115.833" offset="20566706">Mr. Justine who is also a national arbitrator and who is a Professor at New York University, has written an article, which we have cited in our brief and which he has very clearly shown that the quid pro quo is the absolute no-strike clause and the wide-open, all-inclusive arbitration clause which is very common.</text>
            <text syncTime="5136.496" offset="20649357">The -- the use of the term “conventional clause and standard clause” is not to be taken to mean that that clause appears in the vast majority of the union contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5145.242" offset="20684361">That's not at all true.</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.144" offset="20691989">In fact, a great many employers as well as a great many unions want the wide-open clause because they want to be sure that they're not even any wildcat strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.902" offset="20734934">They want to be sure that everything is arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.887" offset="20750921">Larger companies particularly, they want to be sure that there's no contention of arbitrability by the union or by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5168.756" offset="20778402">So the wide-open clause is a very popular clause, it has a lot of reason and merit to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.151" offset="20799927">This conventional clause as Professor Cox has said and I would like to take the time to read to the Court what he has said about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5181.513" offset="20829393">“It is a clause of very limited jurisdiction on the arbitrator.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.840" offset="20846738">It means that -- it says what the arbitrator may not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5189.571" offset="20861680">It has implications of holding that arbitrator to the specific provisions of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.737" offset="20890311">Professor Cox has said and we quote him on page 32 in footnote 37 in the latter half of the footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.801" offset="20922598">"I am persuaded that the conventional arbitration clause is not an agreement to allow an arbitrator to interpret its meaning thereby determining its own jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5212.708" offset="20954154">The contrast between the wide-open clause and a conventional phraseology is too plain to be put down to in inadvertence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.779" offset="20982471">Apparently, the parties choose it because one party, usually the employer, discuss arbitration at least to the point of insisting upon the inclusion of some safeguard against the arbitrators imposing significant obligations not contemplated by the agreement and beyond its scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="5233.172" offset="21036074">This clause tells what the arbitrator cannot do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.194" offset="21048195">The protection sought by the employer would be drastically reduced by construction which give the arbitrator unlimited jurisdiction and merely won against this exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5245.177" offset="21084035">Now here, the rest of the clause goes on to make a distinction which I started to make a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="5252.588" offset="21113710">We're asking the Court to let the Federal District Court subject to the review of the Circuit Courts and this Court to let the district courts look at what the parties have done and what they have intended to determine arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5266.097" offset="21167731">In cases of substance I might add, in other words, to let the -- to let the Federal District courts and we suggest that Congress so intended, look at substantial cases of this kind and make the decision as to arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5283.215" offset="21236276">And once the question is fairly clear that it is arbitrable, then the general power of the arbitrator and this I submit is the difference between Mr. Feller and myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.679" offset="21286118">The general power of the arbitrator then comes into place.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.364" offset="21296880">And he may roll all over the ballpark with all the provisions in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.861" offset="21310777">He may say that something which appears to be ridiculously related to some provision, nonetheless, is governed by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5310.182" offset="21344110">That's his province and we can't complain because we've given him the power to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.372" offset="21364903">But to the point of giving him power, we think the district courts have got to have the authority to make the determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.764" offset="21398444">That since 301 alone is responsible for that authority, we have to look at what 3 -- how 301 was adopted and what it stands for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.310" offset="21432613">And I don't think there's any doubt that the legislative history of 301 puts in the Federal District Court the power to do the things which it did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5344.600" offset="21481723">I -- I well understand and well appreciate the super -- superimposition upon that of our acceptance of arbitrary -- of arbitration and the importance of arbitration in this field.But nonetheless, if we don't have the judicial protection of what we think we have negotiated and in the way of arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5365.366" offset="21564792">And I'm delimiting my argument entirely to that in the way of what we -- what power we have given to the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="5372.904" offset="21594990">If we don't have judicial protection for that, then we are going to have to go in our negotiation to a provision which outlaws arbitration in either in absolute form or in limited form.</text>
            <text syncTime="5386.062" offset="21647653">And that would be a highly undesirable result.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.590" offset="21661759">Mr. Feller's premise is that we don't have and can't have this judicial protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.993" offset="21683388">That anytime in the complaint, and I don't care how he close it and how he seeks to get around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5400.594" offset="21705749">He is nonetheless making this statement in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5403.390" offset="21716929">He's making it in his argument and it is inescapable that his position is, that anytime a claim is made however ridiculous, it's arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5412.196" offset="21752142">Now, we -- we can't conceive, of a holding which would deprive us of what we have negotiated with this union and what we have, how we have lived with this union on the question of the extent of the power to be given to the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="5425.118" offset="21803865">That's very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="5426.805" offset="21810552">Without it, we have not negotiated a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5429.669" offset="21822046">All the no-strike clauses in the world won't do us any good if the arbitrator may arbitrate any and every claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5436.704" offset="21850154">We have no protection whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.525" offset="21857468">All of our efforts to -- to limit this rolling all over the ballpark have gone for naught.</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.577" offset="21973661">So much of what is in our brief and what I prepared for argument is concerned with the power of the Court which counsel has acknowledged is there that it is unnecessary for me to go into the legislative history, into the national policy as reflected by the Railway Labor Act and by the National Labor Relations Act and as shown by the Jacobs Manufacturing Company case and -- and in it's other interpretation of that Act going to show that this a voluntary consensual agreement, that is the agreement to arbitrate and I repeatedly -- and I repeatedly emphasized the difference between the agreement to arbitrate and the other provisions of the contract and that the interpretation which has always been given to these agreements to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.382" offset="22224854">In the Railway Labor Act, under the administration of the Railroad Adjustment Board and the National Mediation Board and -- and elsewhere in our national policy dealing with arbitration has been to give a wide scope to the district courts in their construction of what the parties have agreed to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.314" offset="22312626">The attempt -- the attempt by counsel to merge the Warrior &amp; Gulf case into the American and Enterprise (Inaudible) cases, must be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.379" offset="22396844">Now, our case is not only a more difficult one, it's an entirely different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5580.832" offset="22426728">Here, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter has pointed out, we are striking at the threshold of the arbitrator's jurisdiction, of the arbitrator's authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.821" offset="22478660">In those other cases, we are dealing with matters which are not concerned with the power of the District Court as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="5609.073" offset="22539682">That is the power conferred by Section 301 as I conceive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5613.748" offset="22558386">We're dealing with the power of the District Court in both of these cases to interfere when the functions of the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="5624.574" offset="22601644">That's my conception of the basic difference between our case and the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.362" offset="22636857">So we have here an entirely unrelated case except to the extent that you may say that it all involves arbitration and such arbitration is a very salutary institution, we should treat all these cases as the same as one and -- one and the same involving the same principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="5650.793" offset="22706552">But there is -- there is such a vast difference particularly when we have the -- the admission that the union had the burden of proving that there was a violation of the agreement to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5671.705" offset="22790144">That we could and should take the Warrior &amp; Gulf case entirely out of the realm of consideration of the other two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5690.282" offset="22864541">I don't think it necessary and our brief treats this in some detail to point out that although arbitrators have relied upon the recognition clause and the lock-out clause, and the seniority clause and the discrimination clause and so forth and so on in making decisions on -- on apparently unrelated subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="5712.562" offset="22953671">I don't think it necessary to point out that that subject is a apart and aside from what we're talking about here because of the conduct of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5728.568" offset="23017618">If we didn't have the objective conduct of the parties here in which they paid no attention to these provisions in sustaining and agreeing to in acquiescing in the Company's right to contract out work, then I would I admit that these provisions -- these other provisions of the contract, could be examined and inquired into.</text>
            <text syncTime="5751.881" offset="23110928">As a part from the fact as we pointed out in the brief that their origins, there genesis are in different situations entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5762.670" offset="23154082">The Court has dealt with labor problems from many more years than I have and is much more familiar than I am with the origins, the provisions of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5770.995" offset="23187310">These provisions don't have any direct connection with contracting out work.</text>
            <text syncTime="5776.400" offset="23208939">Each one them has in argument, a different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5778.709" offset="23218239">Lock-out for example, the Court treated with in the Buffalo Linen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5783.225" offset="23236315">If that's a pure type, that's a lock-out situation where an employer shuts down to bring economic pressure upon employees in order to get them to do or not do something in connection with their union activity or negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5796.976" offset="23291277">We don't have a situation here of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5799.968" offset="23303293">We don't have a situation here of depriving certain people of seniority in preference to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="5805.944" offset="23327117">We don't have a lack of recognition of the union here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5808.650" offset="23337984">We had all union employees, all of these -- all of these employees, all of our wage earners are covered by union contracts, five of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5815.717" offset="23366196">And our, union our members are prone in number, the record shows from the inception of our relations with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5823.533" offset="23397543">We didn't have a condition here which -- which should be related to any of these provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="5949.519" offset="23901497">Number one, the Court here construed this contract as it not only had the right to do, but as it had the duty to do under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="5961.670" offset="23950085">It couldn't have avoided construing this contract in any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5966.350" offset="23968789">That its -- its conclusion, its findings are based upon the finest traditions of our law in contract interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5974.979" offset="24003271">And incidentally, the finest traditions of our arbitration law, and I've cited to speak of nationally known arbitrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="5983.009" offset="24035453">I cited the case which Mr. -- Mr. Peter (Inaudible), who is equally as well accepted nationally as the other gentleman in which he said he found no case in which they had done a decision contrary to that, similar to the decision of the Court in our case and the facts weren't all for us in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6000.700" offset="24106193">I've cited the case in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6004.668" offset="24122075">The principles which arbitrators rely upon to a very large extent are all those which this Court relied upon.</text>

            <text syncTime="6018.403" offset="24176933">The Court emphasized those things here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6020.952" offset="24187173">The second basic point on which we rely is that, this decision is good for arbitration, that this decision is good, for our industrial relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6032.591" offset="24233775">That if we have a decision which rejects the theory of our case, that it is going to hurt.</text>
