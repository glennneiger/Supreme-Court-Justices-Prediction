            <text syncTime="21.474" offset="189315">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.893" offset="202898">Before going on with the arguments on the law, that is the language and legislative history of the Capper-Volstead Act and the Borden case, which is a very important case here, since it's the only case which has come before this Court since the enactment of the Capper-Volstead Act, which bears upon the relationship of that Act to the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.240" offset="308328">Before doing that, I should like to put the issues upon this case and its factual context and to review the facts in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.747" offset="362350">There is one preliminary point that may have been left uncertain by the argument yesterday afternoon and that is as to the role of the Secretary of Agriculture in relation to the acquisition of the assets of the Embassy Dairy.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.878" offset="442911">It was suggested that the Secretary may have approved that acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.917" offset="467048">Now, that question was specifically dealt with in the findings of the District Court to which there's no challenge here and that's to be found in the record on pages 493 and 494 of volume 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.034" offset="559522">There, Judge Holtzoff deals specifically with the argument that the approval of a loan by the Baltimore Bank for Cooperatives, which was part of the Farm Credit Administration, represented the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.841" offset="634755">And the bottom paragraph of the page, mentions the fact as to that loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.370" offset="660877">At the top of page 494, he says there is -- the evidence does not sustain the defense for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.983" offset="691284">First, that there is no statutory provision empowering the Secretary of Agriculture to approve any transaction such as is involved here and secondly, the transaction was not authorized either by the Secretary of Agriculture or by anyone acting in his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.226" offset="768293">And I might refer the Court, so far as the evidence --</text>

            <text syncTime="170.269" offset="784488">Is it simply a commercial transaction -- looks at it from a credit standpoint or what does it do?</text>

            <text syncTime="175.960" offset="807163">And I -- I think, if Your Honor will look at the record at page, 653, plaintiff's Exhibit 114, where the bank, in connection with the pretrial proceedings here, was specifically asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.710" offset="906219">This is question 1, the bottom of page 653 of the record, “Did the Baltimore Bank for Cooperatives, through its executive committee or otherwise, (a) authorize, (b) direct, (c) approve, (d) declare a fine to be in the public interest, or (e) sanctioned the acquisition of assets of Embassy Dairy, Incorporated, by Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers Association?”</text>
            <text syncTime="223.739" offset="998379">Answer, this is the bank's answer, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="227.161" offset="1012067">The bank did, however, approve and make a loan for the defendant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="230.521" offset="1025442">So, all you have is the making of the loan and there is no statutory authorization that either the association or the Government has been able to find, which permits the Secretary to approve such an acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.439" offset="1077164">And, he didn't -- and in any event, he did not purport to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.712" offset="1306206">If the Capper-Volstead Act gives him that authority, then -- then, of course, we have the question whether he -- he exercised it here.</text>

            <text syncTime="607.708" offset="2534170">And, I would like to go immediately to the allegation in the complaint here as to what was done.The complaint as to Section 2 alleged that this association which was organized in 1923 has, from -- at least from 1931 to the present time, controlled somewhere between 85% and 95% of the supply of milk in the Washington Metropolitan Area.</text>

            <text syncTime="651.133" offset="2707937">And this cooperative, which as close to 2,000 members, has never achieved a 100% monopoly in the sense that every farmer in the Maryland and Virginia producing area became a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.194" offset="2780139">At all times, they were independent farmers who chose not to become members of the association, who preferred to sell either directly to the dairies, the distributors, or through some other cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.868" offset="2850879">Now, this is -- this cooperative is of course, by far, the largest cooperative in this area but it is not the only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.112" offset="2875852">There are three other such cooperatives which are here now and which have tried, from time to time, to gain a foothold in the market, and one is the Capital Milk Producers Cooperative which sells to the High's retail stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.913" offset="2947009">There's the Valley of Virginia Cooperative which sells through Alexandria Dairy, and there's Queen City Cooperative that sells through the Harvey's Dairy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2330.686" offset="9426108">There were contemporaneous memoranda furnished by the directors of the association to its members and to this Baltimore Bank for Cooperatives which described the reasons for this acquisition, so that, we have a very full factual record on that phase of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.693" offset="9498102">Now, what was the situation as to Embassy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.464" offset="9509177">In 1954, the Defendant-Association controlled 86% of the supply of milk in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.881" offset="9546898">There were about a dozen dairies distributors to whom -- who were, in effect, the wholesalers of milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.905" offset="9587022">The big three, the three largest Chestnut Farms, Thompsons, Lucerne which is Division of Safeways, in which, themselves, counted from well-over 70% of the sales of milk in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.979" offset="9651284">They bought all or practically all of their milk from the defendant Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.073" offset="9675630">There were some other dairies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.121" offset="9683884">The fourth largest dairy was Embassy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.011" offset="9699453">Embassy had about 10% of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.929" offset="9719097">86% to the association, 10% Embassy, and this leaves 6% for the remainder, and I don't think it's very significant in the context of this case but Embassy was important because Embassy did not buy from the association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.064" offset="9783672">Embassy bought its milk from 122 independent farmers who are not members of this Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.877" offset="9822856">Embassy was a vigorous aggressive competitor, in relation to the customers of this Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.451" offset="9869145">Embassy cut prices, particularly, in the sales of milk to the Federal Government for using in federal installations in this area like Fort Myer and old soldiers' home, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.755" offset="9926405">The Federal Government bought about $2 million worth of milk each year and Embassy, which was -- which was the number four dairy in the area, was able to get 47% of that business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.090" offset="9991711">And, it was able to do that because it submitted low bids.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.260" offset="10012400">The association's customers were able to sell only 45% to the Government and, in order to get hat 45%, they had to reduce their prices to the level of Embassy's bids.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.932" offset="10083140">And in -- and in order to permit that arrangement, the association had to reduce the price that it was charging its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.333" offset="10116681">I hope I've made that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.582" offset="10129742">It's fully spelled out in the memorandum which the general manager of the association submitted to the members of the association in 1954 in explaining why they wanted to acquire Embassy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.326" offset="10196720">This is on page 542 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.041" offset="10219499">He says there that “the fact that Embassy was buying its milk from these independents was costing the association about $700,000 a year.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.680" offset="10262131">Then, in the next paragraph, he said that “It isn't limited to the fact that Embassy is not buying its milk from us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.675" offset="10294105">There's this contract milk which is sold to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.041" offset="10307584">As a result, of the Dairy's, that's Embassy's, ability to under-buy and, therefore, undercut in their bidding, it has been necessary for the association to drop the price to a competitive level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.681" offset="10350111">That is, to the price of Embassy's able to buy their milk.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.150" offset="10364008">And, that that -- this is costing the association something like $2 million a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.940" offset="10383130">The District Court found that this acquisition of Embassy's assets, which were worth $1,600,000, was for the purpose of eliminating the competition of the 122 producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.846" offset="10450735">As a result of the acquisition, these 122 farmers, the District Court found, were compelled to leave this market or to join the association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.616" offset="10509876">The -- the purpose of this transaction is abundantly demonstrated by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.749" offset="10538402">There was a testimony by the President of Thompsons Diary, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.169" offset="10556061">That while the negotiations were in progress, he was approached by the manager of the association and he was told that he should not attempt to acquire the -- to buy his milk from the -- from any of these 122 farmers who have been shipping to Embassy because that would “queer” the deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.669" offset="10646026">The memoranda submitted to the bank all showed that the purpose of this transaction was to foreclose these independent markets, to cut off their normal market outlet, to give them the choice either of leaving the Washington market, as many of them did, or of joining the association.</text>

            <text syncTime="2705.083" offset="10923656">The very same arguments that are being made here that Section 2 entirely displaces the antitrust laws, that it gives a remedy which is exclusive, was better than -- that Section 2, in effect, denies persons who are injured by actions such as these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.619" offset="11005889">Independent farmers who were driven out of the market by clubbing tactics, that they have no action for damages, that there's no criminal action, as in Borden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.305" offset="11044551">That is very same argument was accepted by the District Court in the Borden case and the -- this Court, in the unanimous opinion by Chief Justice Hughes said, “We are unable to accept that view of Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.722" offset="11098258">Section 2 is merely a qualification on Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.304" offset="11116544">Section 2 is intended to serve the purpose of protecting the public against the excessive prices where the activities permitted by Section 1, in the opinion of the Secretary of Agriculture, unduly enhanced prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.342" offset="11184776">That Section 2 is a valuable provision because without it, there would be no protection for the public as to activities which are authorized by Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.395" offset="11225004">But, if it's -- it distorts the whole function and scope of Section 2 which, incidentally, has never been used by the Secretary of Agriculture that we have -- that we don't have the benefit of any administrative interpretation or construction of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.347" offset="11284773">Section 2 is not the provision which in it -- which repeals antitrust remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.877" offset="11326882">That, I can say to that only, that this -- this argument was fully made to this Court in the Borden case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.291" offset="11352586">The legislative history materials, which are relied on here, were -- were presented to the Court in the briefs of the Borden Company and the Pure Milk Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.451" offset="11385187">The Court considered them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.808" offset="11390621">The Court had the District Court decision before accepting that argument and it rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.756" offset="11406399">And, if the -- all Your Honors have to do is reread the Borden case to see that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3215.152" offset="12964028">As House Council for this unhappy group of farmers, let me suggest that the important reality in the situation, to my mind, is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.422" offset="13029021">The Government concedes that we have a right to get 100% of these producers into an organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.776" offset="13058487">They admit that, since 1923, we have had from 85% to 95% of the milk production in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.993" offset="13103313">Now, having all this milk, on the income, the question is what are we going to do with in on the outcome?</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.593" offset="13133720">We've got to sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.514" offset="13141452">In other words, if we don't sell it, we're simply a savings bank for milk or a warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.629" offset="13165902">Now, in selling it, we've got to sell it from a monopoly position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.930" offset="13191084">In other words, we are a monopoly all this time and, so, we are selling this milk from a monopoly position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.529" offset="13221491">We are committing acts of monopoly, all along the line, in selling this milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.180" offset="13244061">We're bound to restraint trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.921" offset="13251062">We're bound to fixed prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.090" offset="13259734">We're bound on most occasions, I suppose, or some occasions, to exclude producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.149" offset="13287946">So, everything we do has two sides to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.035" offset="13303515">In other words, in the operation of this monopoly, we are doing acts together under Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.913" offset="13339042">We are, likewise making, from out viewpoint, the necessary contracts and agreements to effectuate the sale of our members' milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.735" offset="13374360">But, unquestionably, we're violating the antitrust laws if we're to be judged by ordinary antitrust standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.826" offset="13414693">Now, what is the test?</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.805" offset="13418559">The Test -- the only test that we can see is undue enhancement of prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.161" offset="13444054">Unless that's the test, the antitrust division can bring a lawsuit or indict us any day in the week.</text>

            <text syncTime="3830.798" offset="15426539">And incidentally, in that respect, when Mr. Elman was asked as to whether the Bank for Cooperatives simply said, “We were good credit risks”, at page 11 of our bli -- brief, we've pointed out very clearly that the Bank for Cooperatives made the statutory findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.718" offset="15506265">And, the statutory findings were that the loan was in aid of the agricultural policies of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.988" offset="15543359">In other words, Section -- it says that the findings were that the Agricultural Market Act require the loan to be in furtherance of policy declared in 1141, namely, promoting the establishment and financing of a farm marketing system of producer-owned and producer-controlled cooperative associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.545" offset="15633533">And by aiding in preventing, and I'm not going to read all the words but this is the point, and preventing depressions in prices for the commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.072" offset="15679613">So, our point is that, in this case, the Government is applying competitive ideas to a branch of the economy where competitive ideas have no place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.107" offset="15739800">Certainly we restrain trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.020" offset="15747427">Certainly, we eliminate competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.510" offset="15757458">As I say, we do it and we do it simply because Congress has said, not only you can do it but that's the way to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.236" offset="15784312">That's the way you keep prices up.</text>
