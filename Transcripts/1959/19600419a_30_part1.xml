            <label>Mr. Greene Chandler Furman</label>
            <text syncTime="12.549" offset="153579">Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. -- Associate Justices, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.664" offset="186075">The present case arises on appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio on an alleged violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.057" offset="231633">It arose from the alleged violation of a Dayton municipal ordinance for housing inspectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.769" offset="278444">It's brought on a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.303" offset="292551">The man -- and I might say in the beginning that the name Eaton is misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.357" offset="320763">The real appellant is Earl Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.094" offset="331734">Mr. Eaton was the first of a number of attorneys in this case, and he is no longer our counsel or connected with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.865" offset="370813">So the actual appellant is Mr. Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.964" offset="403205">The trial court on the writ of habeas corpus was a Court of Common Pleas of Dayton, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.497" offset="437373">It granted the writ on constitutional ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.496" offset="461406">The case was appealed to the Court of Appeals of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.877" offset="486902">I forget the number of it, one sitting there in Dayton, and was reversed by 2-to-1 vote, and that opinion was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.700" offset="542177">From that point, application of appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.034" offset="575509">In the time that this Court noted probable jurisdiction on June the 8th, 1959, the Court, I believe, acted in an unprecedented manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.929" offset="651055">The Court admits it rendered three memorandum opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.662" offset="678013">It was the opinion of four of the justices, that this case was absolutely controlled by the case recently decided in May of Frank versus Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.721" offset="726288">I'm sure that the Court is familiar with this case, and the Frank versus Maryland case and -- and other cases arising on this type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.127" offset="775920">That, as I say, is unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.157" offset="788041">It's a little disconcerting because it means I've got to persuade one of you, gentlemen, that you're wrong, and that is -- is something to undertake.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.138" offset="947911">One of the most frustrating things that I found in law is to prepare a case and to think you're arguing it correctly, and the Court apparently is attentive, and then it goes off and decides a case on some other ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.355" offset="1024815">In view of these memorandums, I know that we must face the case of Frank versus Maryland and distinguish between that case and the present case goes under the name of Eaton, Ohio ex rel.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.554" offset="1085628">Eaton versus Price, Chief of Police.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.088" offset="1107675">I am happy to tell the Court that, at least in my opinion, the two cases can be distinguished in three ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.814" offset="1166608">On the facts of the case and many cases that are similar, differ in facts, and the facts are after all the important thing that we try to find out what are on the Dayton ordinance as compared to the Baltimore ordinance on the penalty of the Dayton ordinance and of the Baltimore ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.323" offset="1284681">The -- the facts of this, in the -- in the Dayton case, Earl Taylor was born in State of Ohio, from what I can gather from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.971" offset="1351241">I might say that I don't know him.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.424" offset="1373080">He was admitted to the plumbers union in Dayton, Ohio in 1914.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.483" offset="1409337">Like a great many people, his home is in his wife's name but he paid some of the cost of it, and they live in a street in the City of Dayton.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.390" offset="1456880">It's a small four-room house, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.235" offset="1484361">He has never had any criminal record.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.659" offset="1502020">And the property, according to him, is in excellent condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.113" offset="1547786">In 1957, a man came there and he said he want to go in his house.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.609" offset="1593762">He asked him why and the man couldn't tell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.355" offset="1604838">He said the law let him come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.234" offset="1628348">He asked him if -- if he was asked in the trial court in the case on habeas corpus if he had anything and he said, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="389.271" offset="1660426">He had a sheet of pad, a yellow paper like that chap over there, the fellow over there.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.666" offset="1682056">I take it's a legal pad and that's what he had.</text>

            <text syncTime="930.309" offset="3824619">It says the core of the Fourth Amendment prohibiting unreasonable searches applied to the States through Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and cites Wolf versus Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.673" offset="3866102">I understand the Court's opinion to adhere fully to that principle and being convinced that the health inspectors request for permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.908" offset="3902986">Now, this was a health inspector and not a housing inspector.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.844" offset="3914794">I don't know exactly what a housing inspector does.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.461" offset="3925243">At least, they apparently didn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.002" offset="3939349">In the premises in midday for the whole purpose of attempting to locate the habitat of disease carrying rodents known to be somewhere in the immediate area was not a request for permission to make that, and the code procedures followed did not amount to enforcement of an unreasonable search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.041" offset="4035584">Now, I believe I understand Mr. Whittaker makes a great deal of difference between this case and the Frank case because there was, let's say, no hot pursuit of rodents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.330" offset="4100681">As far I can see, there was really no hot pursuit of anything because nobody knew what they wanted to find out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1026.355" offset="4208828">He cites in that case, “Whenever the Commissioner of Health shall have caused to suspect that a nuisance exist in any house, cellar or enclosure, he may demand entry therein in the daytime and if the owner or occupier shall refuse or delay to open the same and admit free examination, he shall forfeit -- forfeit and pay for each sum the refusal of $20.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.834" offset="4342680">We now read the ordinance of Dayton that Section (a), you'll find it on the transcript at page 45.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.554" offset="4421569">I hate to read but I don't know how else we can cover it, “The housing inspector is hereby authorized and directed to make inspections to determine the condition of the dwellings, units, rooming houses, rooming units located in the City of Dayton in order to preserve the safety of the occupants and the general health and welfare and great many other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.619" offset="4501817">For the purpose of making such inspections and upon showing appropriate identification, the housing inspector is hereby authorized to enter, examine and survey at any reasonable hour all dwelling units, rooming houses, rooming units and premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="1129.674" offset="4622085">In other words, the great difference is that the Commissioner of Health shall have cause to suspect that a nuisance exist in any house or cellar.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles S.Rhyne</label>
            <text syncTime="1889.540" offset="7661484">It was raised in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.251" offset="7668381">In the Court of Common Pleas, the -- it was contended that this ordinance violated the Fourth Amendment and the similar provision of the Ohio Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.671" offset="7722088">It was contended there that the violation was of the reasonable search and -- and seizure provision of the -- of the Fourth and -- Amendment and the -- the Ohio Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.376" offset="7784887">And the courts all along the line pointed out that of course the Fourth Amendment does not apply to the States and they proceeded to consider this on the basis of whether it was a violation of the similar Ohio constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.176" offset="7844028">And this is crystal clear in the opinions of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.876" offset="7866911">In fact, the only mention, the only mention of the Fourteenth Amendment by any court below is in the -- the Ohio Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court opinions where they have a quotation from the Givner case, a Maryland case, and it just happens to mention down in the body of the quotation the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.349" offset="7952802">Now, after we raise this jurisdictional point here, the appellants did the rather unprecedented thing of filing all of the briefs in all the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.269" offset="7996479">In order, they said, to demonstrate that they did indeed raise this question under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.945" offset="8019153">But unfortunately, those briefs don't help them at all because the -- in all three briefs in the Court of Common Pleas and the Ohio Court of Appeals and in the Supreme Court, they do have a quotation from -- from Wolf versus Colorado, which mentions the Fourteenth down in the quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.649" offset="8097938">But these are -- that's quoted under a provision of their briefs in all three instances that argues that this ordinance is a violation of the Ohio Constitution and of the Fourth Amendment not of the Fourteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.916" offset="8154990">And interestingly enough, in the Ohio Court of Appeals brief, counsel distinguishes the instant case and the Givner case in Maryland on the ground that the Givner case in Maryland involved the Fourteenth Amendment and this involves the Fourth in the Ohio Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.656" offset="8221968">And they made the same distinction in the Ohio Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.770" offset="8242448">So the only real mention of the Fourteenth Amendment below is made in a brief amicus curiae filed by the Ohio Civil Liberties Union in the Supreme Court of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.152" offset="8291976">Now, that mere mention by the Supreme Court of this amicus curiae and the Supreme Court of Ohio is certainly not a drawing in question sufficient, at least at that level, to sustain jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.567" offset="8361671">Now, the provision that relates to the jurisdiction of this Court that requires the drawing in question below, I think, is -- is founded on two very sound things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.302" offset="8404616">Number one, when you're reviewing a -- a decision of the highest court of a State as a matter of comity, you're going to reverse them on a ground that wasn't raised below, the least -- and since this -- you're in effect reviewing, you should review what they're -- what' they're -- what they did below and what they said below, and it -- it wasn't raised at all below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.522" offset="8501478">You're not really reviewing what the -- what the lower court did or the Supreme Court of Ohio did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.997" offset="8527391">Now, here, where you have a challenge to something that's been done since the real founding of our -- our nation and a claim that a new constitutional right is being erected and you're questioning Ohio action, Ohio legislation and Ohio courts, the very least that could be required is that you get the views of the Ohio courts on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.883" offset="8638882">And it seems that this -- this statute was put in here to -- to require the people who -- who challenge state statutes in particular to specify and to specify with a -- with a riffle, not a shotgun, their objections why they think this is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.854" offset="8718817">I think it's very sound statutory procedure and very sound that the Court, in its decisions, which we have cited in our brief, has always held that you must use the words and not try to come here by analogy or afterthought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.297" offset="8796557">Now, it's true that the Fourteenth Amendment, as Mr. Justice Whitaker said in the Frank case, does apply the -- the heart and core of the unreasonable search and seizure provisions of the Fourth states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.323" offset="8852668">But again, the argument that the -- the Fourteenth was applied in that way was not at all before the Ohio courts all the way up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.461" offset="8901256">They merely construed their own constitutional provision and pointed out quite properly that the Fourth Amendment has no application in Ohio or to -- to state action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2265.014" offset="9163421">But the Ohio Supreme Court, under its own rules, could not consider any attack on this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.937" offset="9183169">It wasn't raised in the two lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.137" offset="9191946">Now, this attack was not raised in the Court of Common Pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.571" offset="9205635">So that question couldn't be presented even to the parties in the Ohio Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.857" offset="9222771">Now, with reference to the quotation from Wolf, I pointed out, if Your Honor please, that that quotation comes under a section of their brief in which they argue that this ordinance is invalid under the Fourth Amendment, not under Fourteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.037" offset="9275538">And that counsel in his brief, both instances where he cited Wolf verus Colorado, says this case is different from the Baltimore case because that case involved the Fourteenth and this involves the Fourth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.385" offset="9328933">So I don't believe that any of the courts below considered that the Fourteenth was ever cited to them or argued to them as a reason for the invalidity of this ordinance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3175.730" offset="12806248">In fact, I think there are more safeguards in -- in this case and this identification is required and Baltimore does not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3194.790" offset="12882526">Now, I don't believe that that particular provision of the Baltimore ordinance was the reason for the decision in Frank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.437" offset="12917112">I think that the Frank case was based upon the idea that from the beginning of our country and now, you have had these inspections for health and safety reasons, and that these hidden hazards cannot be discovered from the outside.</text>

            <text syncTime="3238.846" offset="13058800">First of all, the reference to the experience in the City of New York, which is quoted by amicus curiae on page 5 of their brief, where they say that in a 15 block area, there were 567 complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.367" offset="13112822">The grand jury investigating slums there had this 15 block area inspected and found 12,445 violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.026" offset="13155453">And then on page 21 of our own brief, we give the experience in Dayton where four years ago, 16 people died because of defective gas heaters, unvented gas flues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.225" offset="13208221">Three years ago, nine died.</text>

            <text syncTime="3280.672" offset="13226088">And last year, under this ordinance, there were 2912 defective gas flues discovered upon inspection which could not have been discovered from the outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.224" offset="13272273">And in 10 instances, the violation was so bad that they had to call the utility to come and cut all the gas at once.</text>

            <text syncTime="3313.774" offset="13358477">So I don't believe that -- that this systematic inspection has ever been the basis of the type of thing that we're -- I mean, that -- that the -- the requirement of probable cause has ever been required for the type of inspection that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.290" offset="13440502">And I -- it is certainly true that this -- in the last few years is the first that there has been any question raised at all about this type of inspection and particularly that anyone has a constitutional right to prevent it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.323" offset="13500688">I call attention of the Court to the fact that Dayton has had an ordinance on this subject since 1846.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.821" offset="13530676">And at 1846, they required the homeowners to allow inspectors to come in and inspect chimneys and flues and stoves for fires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.984" offset="13571323">And then there is a whole series of ordinance that Dayton has had since then just as Baltimore, it had in the Frank case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.321" offset="13596609">So something that -- that the people have never considered to be a violation of their constitutional right to raise it to the status of a constitutional right under the Fourteenth Amendment is going quite far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.828" offset="13662647">I call attention to the fact that while it's true, the -- the Fourteenth Amendment does apply the unreasonable search and -- and seizure, a part of the Fourth Amendment to the States under the decision of this Court that the Fourth does not prohibit all entries, it prohibits only unreasonable entries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.629" offset="13741850">And in this instance, where something has been done in -- in Dayton for more than 100 years and no one has questioned it, when it's been done all over the country where historically, the community has always protected itself against the carelessness of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.913" offset="13819068">And I also call attention of the -- of the Court to the fact, and I'm -- I'm glad the -- the entire ordinance will be before the Court now because this ordinance requires running such thing as running hot and cold water, bathrooms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.333" offset="13876746">The -- the things that are -- are needed today and people are not going to live like cattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.338" offset="13896704">And of course, this ordinance is aimed at protecting the poor and the helpless who live in slum areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.255" offset="13924394">Those poor and -- and helpless will not get heat or anything else unless the police power steps in and -- and requires it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.073" offset="13963682">I think that the emphasis upon decent housing and in recent years is one of the -- the greatest things that's going on in our country because in these slum areas, why, that's where disease and crime breed and grow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.374" offset="14020838">And this police power, which has existed from the very beginning of our country without question, it's true, it -- it's expanded some because of the requirements of -- of urbanized living.</text>

            <text syncTime="6081.392" offset="24428962">That's Manley v. Georgia, it's cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6087.322" offset="24452681">And further, as to the questions of police power legislative enactments in the exercise of police power are limited requirements for due process -- are limited by the requirements of due process law -- of law under the Fourteenth Amendment, Whitney v. California.</text>
            <text syncTime="6106.008" offset="24527391">And as to whether this would unduly hamper or restrict the State to require process before the entry of a home or a private home, there is nothing in this prohibition to -- which tends to lessen the power of the State to regulate for the public welfare but the guarantee of the due process demands that the law should be reasonable -- should not be unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="6132.680" offset="24634075">And that the mean selected shall have a reasonable, a real and substantial relation to the objects sought to be obtained, that's in Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502.</text>
            <text syncTime="6144.034" offset="24679528">Those cases were cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6150.378" offset="24704920">And again, the last -- a question that has been raised here that since reference was made to the Fourth Amendment rather than the Fourteenth Amendment used the case properly in court and stated here the philosophy of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6172.377" offset="24792900">And thus, the Fourteenth Amendment was well expressed by Mr. Justice Butler speaking in -- for the majority in Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20, 32, “The search,” -- and this is a quote, “The search of a private dwelling without a warrant is in itself unreasonable and abhorrent to our laws.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6199.465" offset="24901256">And I think when we get to the heart of the question as to whether we're in court or not, I think only this Court can say.</text>
            <text syncTime="6210.810" offset="24946604">And I would refer to the case of Lovell v. the City of Griffin, Griffin, Georgia quoted at 304 U.S. 444.</text>
            <text syncTime="6224.404" offset="25000939">This is a case that has been cited many, many times since it was originally decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6232.281" offset="25032495">And the meat of this is we think that this question was adequately presented and was decided in the instant case whether it was so presented and whether it's decided is itself a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6247.545" offset="25093517">And a long line of decisions is referred to in this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6254.512" offset="25121416">More recently, this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Black ion Staub v. the City of Baxley, Baxley, Georgia and reported in 355 U.S. 313, “Whether,” and this is a quote and reversing the State of Georgia, this Court stated, “Whether a pleading sets up a sufficient right of action or defense, grounded on the Constitution or a law of the United States, is necessarily a question of federal law, and where a case coming from a state court presents that question, this Court must determine for itself the sufficiency of the allegations displaying the right or defense, and is not concluded by the view taken by the state court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6300.350" offset="25304795">And that's how we contend primarily that we're in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6304.511" offset="25321409">And this Court itself will decide whether we are or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6321.666" offset="25390059">I would also refer the Court, this is also in a brief in Carter v. Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="6328.429" offset="25417122">This is a very early case cited at 177 U.S. 442 or they reported at 177 U.S. 442 and that is also cited in the Lovell v. Griffin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6349.605" offset="25501759">To -- to delve into this question a bit further as to how the case maybe presented to this Court, it appears from all the cases that counsel has been able to research on the subject that no particular form of words or phrases are essential if the complete record shows by clear intendment, the claim of invalidity of the state statute was timely raised in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6381.064" offset="25627669">The first reference that I have found to the Fourteenth Amendment, Equal Protection and the Due Process Clause is in the reply brief of Mr. Eaton in the Court of Common Pleas and the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6400.543" offset="25705514">This is -- quote appears in the appendix, page 42.</text>
