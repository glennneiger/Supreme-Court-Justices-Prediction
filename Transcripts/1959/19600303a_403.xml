            <text syncTime="13.608" offset="157759">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.049" offset="163610">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.941" offset="175104">The position of the respondents here is that there is no labor dispute within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act so as to deprive the District Court of jurisdiction to issue the interlocutory injunction which it did issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.610" offset="241768">I would like to make clear at the outset that the basis upon which we make that contention is that the dispute was over terms and conditions of employment, a board of foreign flag vessel, only transiently in a United States court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.736" offset="326301">It is not a claim of special position for a foreign shipowner and some of the colloquy particularly between counsel and Mr. Justice Brennan yesterday, seemed to me to be turning on the question of a foreign shipowner in an American court.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.947" offset="391189">I'd like to point out the difference between the owner of a foreign ship and a foreign shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.203" offset="416162">One looks to the corporate owner, the other looks to the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.769" offset="434448">It might well be that you would have an American owner of a foreign flag vessel and we believe that such an American owner in court would be entitled to the same relief here as these respondents are.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.409" offset="488991">It is not the position as a foreign shipowner, but as the owner of a foreign ship which centers around the question of whether there is a labor dispute because of the terms and conditions of employment aboard that ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.404" offset="552939">Now, there is some question as -- in my mind as to just what the petitioners are claiming the labor dispute here is.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.295" offset="588570">In response to a question for Mr. Justice Whittaker yesterday, counsel stated that there was no dispute with the crew members.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.997" offset="623365">In the reply brief at page 5, the statement is made in the first full sentence at the top of the page after the quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.854" offset="674774">The petitioners in picketing were not seeking to change wages, hours or working conditions on the S. S. Nikolos.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.290" offset="712495">In response to a question from the Chief Justice yesterday, counsel said that it would make no difference so far as the Norris-LaGuardia Act was concerned, if the wages here were not far below the American standar, which their members have aboard competing American flagships.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.828" offset="786683">In fact, the position that counsel took yesterday was that they were here seeking to shut this foreign flag vessel out of this trade.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.750" offset="1330343">In fact, the intercoastal American trade has practically dried up.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.465" offset="1345181">Now, suppose this union were to go out and picket the railroad with the intent of stopping the railroad from loading all intercoastal -- all transcontinental cargo, in order that American ships would have more business so that their members would have more jobs, I don't think that would be a labor dispute.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="332.926" offset="1435042">Why don't you read the specific definition of what labor dispute is in the Norris-LaGuardia Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="338.671" offset="1458030">That's what the case must turn on</text>

            <text syncTime="343.998" offset="1479346">And, I think, Your Honor is correct that it is the statute that we are here construing that the problem is to determine just what that definition is.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.534" offset="1541517">Now, the term, “labor dispute,” this -- it's found in 29 U.S.C 113 (c) and at page 40 of our brief, we have quoted the definition from the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947.</text>

            <label>Mr. John D. Mosser</label>
            <text syncTime="390.447" offset="1665128">I was comparing this case at that point, Your Honor, to the Benz decision of this Court which was rendered three years ago and in which the Court held the Taft-Hartley Act was not enacted with any eye to foreign labor relations or disputes over employment conditions aboard a foreign flag vessel.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="410.807" offset="1746631">I can understand your quoting both.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.411" offset="1753004">I can't quite understand your partiality to one.</text>

            <label>Mr. John D. Mosser</label>
            <text syncTime="416.964" offset="1771186">Barely to say if -- that the argument I make in my brief, Your Honor, is that the sections are identical except for one word and I quote the different word.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.965" offset="1811205">The definition in the Norris-LaGuardia Act is, "The term, labor dispute, includes any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment regardless of whether the dispute stand in approximate relation of employer and employee."</text>
            <text syncTime="458.856" offset="1938787">Now, the only difference between the two acts is that the Labor Management Relations Act, instead of saying terms or conditions of employment, says terms tenure or conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.267" offset="1980479">The one word tenure is the difference.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="471.931" stopTime="480.142">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="471.931" offset="1991137">Perhaps the proximate relation clause means that it doesn't have to be a quarrel between a particular employer and his particular employee.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_d_mosser" startTime="480.142" stopTime="620.020">
            <label>Mr. John D. Mosser</label>
            <text syncTime="480.142" offset="2023946">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.278" offset="2032515">But I think the definition does point that it must be a dispute over the terms or conditions of employment or over the right to represent persons in seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.963" offset="2095208">And if as the respondent say in their reply brief, they are concerned and don't want to change wages, hours or working conditions aboard this vessel and don't want to represent this crew, it's hard for me to see where there would be any labor dispute even if this were an American flag vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.966" offset="2175248">Now, I hasten to -- to point out that I don't think the records supports the interpretation of this dispute which counsel has put on in it the last minute in this reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.365" offset="2236792">It's not the position they took anywhere up until that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.323" offset="2256645">The position which they took in their opening brief in this Court is it stated at the top of page 13 of that brief and it states the evidence shows that the controversy between the parties concerns terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.046" offset="2331564">The fact is that when this vessel arrived in court Mr. Willoughby, the petitioners Seattle agent, went aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.505" offset="2373360">And at page 61 of the record, he testified that he told the captain, "Well, I told him by virtue of the policy of my union that I was interested in the wages, hours and conditions existing aboard the ship."</text>
            <text syncTime="583.345" offset="2436786">At page 29 of the record, in his affidavit, he's outlined his efforts to find somebody with whom he could negotiate and states that affiant has not been able to find or talk with any person or persons in this area or been referred to any person who could be contacted by long distance who would admit to having authority to negotiate and to adjust the difference with affiant's organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.673" offset="2538036">In the Court of Appeals, in both their briefs, they made quite clear that what they wanted to do was change the wages, hours and working conditions aboard the vessel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.868" offset="4406836">But I think that generally, there is no right question, but what a -- an American union has a right at some point to go into the question of wages, hours and working conditions aboard on American flag vessel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1105.088" offset="4523760">And, I think, it may go farther than mere injunctive relief, because the Court has indicated that the Norris-LaGuardia Act serves as a shield not only against injunctive relief, but to a substantive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.145" offset="4583946">In the Hutcheson case, they said, there could be no criminal prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1552.976" offset="6315238">Now, in past cases, the Court has been very clear that when Congress wanted to apply our laws, labor laws, to foreign employment, it required that that be spelled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.357" offset="6368841">There was a case of Foley Bros. versus Filardo, which involved the Eight Hour Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1578.197" offset="6416175">And the question was whether the Eight Hour Law applied to that employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.325" offset="6436655">And the Court said there was universal language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.109" offset="6447835">Every laborer, every employer, it said, this does not apply, because if Congress wants us to apply laws to situations of labor in foreign countries, where everyone knows labor conditions are far different, they must specifically spell it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.597" offset="6521710">In another transportation field, there have been two cases, as to whether the Federal Mediation Board had jurisdiction to determine a bargaining agent or hold a representational election for the right to represent airline dispatchers working in foreign country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1642.239" offset="6672280">Then they closest case we have, of course, is the Benz case, which was a situation virtually identical with his concerning the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.039" offset="6715538">You had there an American union picketing a Liberian vessel in an American port.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.201" offset="6744168">And the question was whether the Taft-Hartley Act preempted the District of the -- of the -- the jurisdiction of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.034" offset="6787532">Now, that was a jurisdictional question just as this is a jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.464" offset="6813236">There, as here, the crew was foreign and had signed articles subject to Liberian law abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.996" offset="6847404">And there is here, the terms and conditions of employment were far below those in American ships competing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.414" offset="6881050">And there as here, the union said that we are trying -- they -- they clearly said there as they don't here, “We want to represent this crew and -- and be its bargaining agent."</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.781" offset="6930474">But they also said, “We're trying to protect our interest in the grain trade between Portland and India."</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.752" offset="6958373">And, I think, that if in that case, the Taft-Hartley Act didn't apply with virtually -- except for that one word tenure the same definition of labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.283" offset="7008528">It is hard to see how the Norris-LaGuardia Act would apply in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.295" offset="7036531">Getting outside the labor field, we have the example of Romero and Lauritzen, where this Court has said that the universal -- every seaman of the Jones Act does not necessarily apply to a foreign seaman injured aboard a foreign ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.589" offset="7105703">And in Romero, the Court specifically pointed that it would be -- it's -- it's not within any policy of the United States and would be a terrific burden on commerce if the standard of compensation must change in every port to which the vessel goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.762" offset="7174457">Now there, you were talking about compensation for an injury which may or may not occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.734" offset="7194311">But I think the standard of wages is much more significantly a standard of compensation that can't change in every port to which the vessel goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.373" offset="7236838">If you look at the legislative history of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, the Act itself says nothing about applying to foreign shipping or to foreign commerce at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.354" offset="7280828">If you look at the -- its legislative history which we have included a few excerpts that we were able to find that shed any light at all and they aren't talking about this foreign shipping problem, but there is language there, such as the Court relied on in the Benz case that it was enacted to take care of domestic disputes involving American working men, the working men of this country which would indicate that it was not intended to apply in this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1861.297" offset="7548531">I think, though, that the question here is -- certainly, Congress has since given back to the courts power to issue injunctions in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.335" offset="7604746">And I'd like to point out here the -- the problem that arises, if Taft-Hartley doesn't apply, if we aren't going to go aboard these ships and certify collective bargaining agents, then there is no equality if these treaty means equality between of -- the owner of a foreign ship and the owner of an American ship, because without certification, you can never put an end to your labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.906" offset="7707042">Whereas, in -- on the American ship, once you had a bargaining agent, it would be an unfair labor practice and you could get an injunction through the Board, if some other union came along and picketed you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.879" offset="7754898">Under the new Act, if somebody wants to represent the seaman aboard a ship, they -- or aboard it -- for any employer, they can picket, but within 30 days, they must apply to become for an -- certification election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.196" offset="7812159">Here, they could never apply under the interpretation that's been given to the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.494" offset="7833370">And so, you would have the situation that one union could picket for 30 days then it would to stop, perhaps, if there's any way to get to the Board to stop it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.369" offset="7876838">But another union could come along.You just never have an end to the organizational problem which are our laws supplementing Norris-LaGuardia have taken care of for American employers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1976.627" offset="8009853">The reason I ask you this, there was real abuses, which led to the enactment of the Norris-LaGuardia Act derived from the abuses of issuing injunctions in the federal courts by a reason of diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.230" offset="8076309">There were hardly -- there were few cases in which the Court had jurisdiction as such in the federal courts, in the Debs case, of course, where they strike an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.225" offset="8116224">But on the whole, in the main overwhelming mischief that was complained of and that was felt in rightly -- as I believe, was that the adversity cases got into the federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2209.435" offset="8941066">In the District Court, the only argument had been the one we've had here so far as to whether Norris-LaGuardia labor dispute was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.557" offset="8985579">The Court of Appeals found jurisdiction under Section 1331.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.531" offset="9009507">And as counsel points out, there is a seeming conflict between that decision and the decision of this Court last year in Romero.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.788" offset="9046497">Now, I think the sounder basis for jurisdiction here is in admiralty, which -- and the question is whether admiralty has the power to issue the equitable relief of an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.134" offset="9107937">At the outset, I'll say that there is dictum in decisions of this Court that admiralty does not have equitable remedial powers and does not issue injunctions except in cases of limitation of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.477" offset="9173243">However, that decision was in the case of Schoenamsgruber versus Hamburg American Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.845" offset="9222771">These cases are discussed at 22 and -- to 24 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.441" offset="9249102">That was a -- a case in which the question was whether a -- a District Court could stay proceedings pending arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.867" offset="9290794">And the Court held that it could and in the process of it, noted that a stay of proceedings was not an injunction, but it went on to have this gratuitous language that admiralty doesn't issue injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.272" offset="9344502">There are earlier cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.308" offset="9352652">The Eclipse is perhaps the fountain of this doctrine from the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.514" offset="9377416">That was a case where the request was that a court of admiralty, reform a contract for the sale of a vessel and enforce some trust provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.657" offset="9426004">Now, admiralty doesn't deal with sales of vessels to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.549" offset="9441573">The sale of a vessel is not a -- a suit over the sale of a vessel isn't the suit in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.653" offset="9461948">So, of course, this claim for equitable relief, in connection with a sale of a vessel, wouldn't be within admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.329" offset="9492668">The Court there noted the claims were -- there was nothing maritime about the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.115" offset="9515865">That was the language of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.222" offset="9524224">Yet, it went on to give again this dictum that admiralty -- although it exercises its jurisdiction upon equitable principles, has not the characteristic powers of the court of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.879" offset="9578872">Now, I think recent decisions of this Court has made clear that the real doctrine is that when admiralty has jurisdiction, when the basic subject matter of the suit is an admiralty claim, admiralty has equitable powers, whenever they're necessary to justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.608" offset="9657762">Romero, itself, said that all claims regardless of the remedy sought involving a maritime cause of action where cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.497" offset="9705409">It said that in giving its reason for lack of jurisdiction under 1331, that the admiralty courts had been completely adequate to the vindication or protection of rights grounded in federal maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.980" offset="9779284">Now, if they didn't have equitable powers when they were necessary, they couldn't be completely adequate to the protection of those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.972" offset="9815228">In Swift &amp; Company versus Compania Colombiana, in 1950, this Court pointed out a lot of this dicta in passed decision and described them as a good deal of loose talk and said that in that case, admiralty could set aside the fraudulent transfer of a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.217" offset="9912195">The libel there was in personam with foreign attachment and the attachment was necessary to the jurisdiction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.864" offset="9950856">The basic libel was clearly within admiralty's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.563" offset="9969664">And the Court there -- what happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.012" offset="9979382">The respondent in the suit transferred the vessel to somebody else, before it was attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.757" offset="10010415">And unless that fraud -- that transfer which the Court held was fraudulent, could be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.985" offset="10035284">The attachment would have to be dissolved and there would be no jurisdiction in the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2531.599" offset="10229739">We were arguing that any case of federal merit -- involving federal maritime law was one arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, within the meaning of Section 1333.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.845" offset="10286791">The Court of Appeals' decision followed the dicta of this Court and said that admiralty cannot issue an injunction, but said this is a clear distinction from the situation in Romero, because Romero had a completely adequate remedy in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.712" offset="10350216">Here, this is a case in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.291" offset="10356485">It is -- there is no completely adequate remedy in admiralty and therefore, we think that the reasoning of Romero would not apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.606" offset="10385847">And since it is a maritime claim arising under the Constitution of the United States, it is one where federal question jurisdiction exists.</text>

            <text syncTime="3601.684" offset="14510059">Mr. Chief Justice, if Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.137" offset="14519881">I would like to clarify one matter which is in nature of its dispute that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.734" offset="14546317">We have issued all intent to interfere anyway with the internal economy of this ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.325" offset="14572648">We realize because of this Court's decision in the Benz case and we could not represent or seek to represent these foreign seamen or to bargain for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.292" offset="14608488">The position of the union is best expressed in the picket sign which was used on board the Willoughby, as it circled the Nikolos.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.929" offset="14651120">The AFL-CIO seamen protest loss of their employment, because of the use of foreign flagships employing seamen at substandard wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.889" offset="14694902">That was the nature of the protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.000" offset="14707336">The dispute could have been settled in a variety of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.497" offset="14721337">The record indicates that Mr. Schultz, who was the assistant operating manager of National Boat Carriers also he's the assistant operating manager of Transea and of Seatankers which is a respondent in this case, so that these American corporations are closely related in Seatankers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.682" offset="14798137">Seatankers was the agency which selected the Nikolos to use in this trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.731" offset="14822275">And necessarily, we hope that the economic pressure which we used could influence Seatankers, perhaps, to change its mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.815" offset="14858637">And certainly if the only reason for employment of a foreign ship is that the wages, hours and conditions on that ship, are one-fifth of those on American ship, but that reason disappears and American ship would be used, so that the conditions on the Nikolos were important with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.677" offset="14930108">They existed as conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.917" offset="14938990">The conditions work that the wages were one-fifth of those on these American ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.783" offset="14958529">But this was a fact which existed when Seatankers procured the Nikolos to enter the salt trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.193" offset="14992175">So that that is the nature of the dispute and we think that the Norris-LaGuardia Act should apply to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.429" offset="15021119">There are other problems Mr. Mosser suggested that if we picketed a railroad company that that might be within the protection of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, but obviously it would not, because the industry would be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.350" offset="15084753">The trade, craft and occupation would be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.617" offset="15097814">We would not be in the same industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.125" offset="15107845">It would be a different industry and Norris-LaGuardia would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.291" offset="15124564">We think that a case more closely analogous would be a case in which, for example, in American Longshore Union would picket in a -- in American port to protest the use of foreign non union longshoremen on the -- American joined the foreign ship unloading the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.608" offset="15197811">Or if, for example, an American shipowner during the course of a maritime strike, should use a foreign registered vessel, which he might even know in a trade which had been occupied by the struck ships so as to break the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.354" offset="15260818">Or, if an American shipowner and there are some operating foreign ships under American contract, should have the termination of the contract say, I won't bargain any further and the union would be told of -- if you put up a picket line and try to strike, the Norris-LaGuardia Act will not prevent an injunction at the behest of the American shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.516" offset="15349426">We think those are cases more closely analogous to the present one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.749" offset="15370324">Now, there was one question asked by Mr. Justice Whittaker the other day with respect to the possibility that on this foreign ship, it might be considered a little piece of Liberia in the port of Tacoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.405" offset="15424972">That problem was dealt with in the case of Scharrenberg against the Dollar Steamship Company, in which Mr. Justice Clark wrote the opinion of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.382" offset="15476903">That's at 245 U.S. 122 at page 127, decided in 1917.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.641" offset="15501981">Mr. Justice Clark said this, “It is, of course, true that for the purposes of jurisdiction a ship, even on the high seas as often said to be a part of the territory of the nation whose flag it flies.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.980" offset="15547329">But in the physical sense, this expression is obviously figurative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.885" offset="15562898">Quoting, International Law Digest, Moore, vol. I Section 174, “And to expand the doctrine to the extent of treating seamen employed on such a ship as working in the country of its registry is quite impossible.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.917" offset="15619009">And the case was quoted with approval by this Court in the Cunard Steamship Company case.</text>
