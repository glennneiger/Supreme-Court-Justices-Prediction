            <text syncTime="10.869" offset="146892">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.625" offset="161834">With permission of the Court, in my remaining time, I wish to devote it principally to a discussion of the silver platter doctrine, that is the question of whether or not, a rigid rule of exclusion in the federal courts should be adopted where other than federal officers are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.290" offset="228498">That was the ground of decision in the state -- in the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.247" offset="252322">That was the ground on which the United States Attorney proceeded in presenting the case on the motion to suppress evidence in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.181" offset="284087">And we submit that on the basis of the facts in this record here, this record in Elkins demonstrates the wisdom of such a procedure on the part of the United States Attorney, and there was such a ruling on the part of the United States District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.813" offset="342601">There's additional graph --</text>

            <text syncTime="60.040" offset="343542">Mr. Wilkey, before you -- before you get into your argument, well, this -- will you include in it the question as to whether this was sufficient constitutionally under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.977" offset="411251">You are going -- yesterday you said you were going to discuss that.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.514" offset="429432">As I -- as I understood you, you weren't going to rely on the fact that under state law, it was -- the affidavit was sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.578" offset="465690">You said you felt that under federal law, it was and that you would discuss it, will -- will you get to that?</text>

            <text syncTime="102.344" offset="512711">And there's an additional ground relied on by the Court of Appeals, which I wish to discuss and that is the validity of the federal warrant for the search and which -- by which the tapes came into the custody of the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.314" offset="580629">That was an additional ground which we submit all of the evidence was fully developed in the trial court and the Circuit Court relied upon that in addition to the silver platter doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.761" offset="618454">Now, in connection with that, I should like to post for the Court's consideration, the situation which confronted the federal officers at the time of the state seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.816" offset="658683">The FBI agent testified that he learned of these seizures by reading the newspapers, the following morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.790" offset="686582">Portions of the tapes were printed in the newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.982" offset="699329">It was apparent that if all of the accounts were true, there existed a federal violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.598" offset="721795">Following up this information coming to him, he went over to the state officers and he listened to some -- to one of the tapes that I believe was on Tuesday morning and the tape was taken from him to be presented down below to the state grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.236" offset="776338">The United States of Attorney was aware of this possible federal violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.743" offset="798386">Now, the federal agent had heard a knock on that one tape and he had seen the notes accompanying the tape indicating a synopsis of the tape, the names of the parties to the conversations, and year at that time or later, the FBI agent talked to one of the parties Langley and learned that he had not given any consent to the interception of these messages.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.959" offset="895248">Now, on the basis of that, it was public knowledge, and that there was a federal violation.And it was knowledge which the U.S. Attorney and the FBI agents have.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.852" offset="934745">So the tapes wound up in a state of limbo.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.143" offset="951986">They were not suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.331" offset="956688">They were held in the custody of the Attorney General of Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.460" offset="973197">They were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.271" offset="976436">They were existing.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.482" offset="981347">And on that basis, the FBI agent went to the state authorities and asked permission again to listen to the tapes which he did on August the 13th, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.153" offset="1020008">Following a complete audit of the tapes on which he testified, he could tell because of the background noises of the conversation and of the wire noises that they were intercepts, they were not recordings made outside of the telephone system, he then sworn out a federal warrant, and on that basis, on September the 5th, secured the tapes from the custody of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.289" offset="1132544">That warrant, I think, is unquestionably based on personal knowledge of the agent, it was based on all the information available, and it was clearly set forth in that warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.747" offset="1570356">I think -- I think that is on -- being point out to by my co-counsel here.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.729" offset="1594284">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.759" offset="1598360">I'm sorry if I misstated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.475" offset="1605256">I did not want to -- I do not want to overstate this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.852" offset="1618735">There is no need to.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.812" offset="1622601">This is a clear case of complete innocence on the Federal Government's part.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.980" offset="1643290">I think the testimony is that before any communication from Schrunk or anybody else in the state side, the FBI agents had seen the testimony or seen the report of the raid in the newspapers and were discussing it in their office, as to whether or not a federal violation was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.153" offset="1716015">And as I was about to say, one of the state authorities, it may have Langley wrote a letter to the Attorney General of Oregon and to the federal authorities and to someone else to the telephone company notifying them of the seizure of these tapes which indicated interceptions in violation of both state and federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.108" offset="1799816">I do not wish to overstate my case here because it's a good one without any elaboration or whatever, but here -- this is a situation confronting the federal authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.090" offset="1851747">And in -- as Mr. Justice Whittaker pointed out yesterday in a question, would the bungling or purposeful misuse of process by a state court forever bar the Federal Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="449.056" offset="1899604">Now here, the petitioner Elkins has accused District Attorney Langley of purposefully misusing state process.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.995" offset="1931368">I make no brief for one side or another in this power struggle between these people in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.575" offset="1953625">But if that is true, if there was a purposeful misuse of process here, abuse of process by the State District Attorney, should that forever bar the Federal Government from prosecuting an apparent federal violation here?</text>
            <text syncTime="478.059" offset="2015587">We submit that the Federal Government proceeded in the only way that it could have, that is, it got out a warrant and it went to the place where the tapes where, and it took the tapes under that warrant and then proceeded to present the evidence to a federal grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.938" offset="2095104">I -- the -- because of the nature of the state court's rulings, these tapes were in a sort of limbo.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.015" offset="2127391">They were instruments of crime under both Oregon and federal law, able decided yesterday, they were the fruits of crime, they could not be returned to the petitioners Elkins and Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.794" offset="2182562">They were going to be held in state custody, and so the United States proceeded in the only way it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.258" offset="2208371">Now, I'm reminded of Mr. Justice Frankfurter's comment yesterday that this -- that this action took place by people who were not in the same household.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.658" offset="2245987">And that is very clear on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.910" offset="2254973">The federal authorities were not in the same household with the state people.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.615" offset="2273782">And I'm reminded of Mr. Justice Holmes remarks in the Silverthorne case, where it -- where he said for the Court that if knowledge of them, the facts, is gained from an independent source, they maybe proved like any others, but the knowledge gained by the Government's own wrong cannot be used by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.719" offset="2354239">Here, there is no own wrong by the Government in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.108" offset="2371793">And here, we have to take the situation as it is and proceed in accordance with the due process of a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.647" offset="2401991">We submit that on the facts which came out yesterday in argument and on the facts which I'll go into later, that on a situation like this, the wisdom, the policy of wisdom is to allow the Federal District Judge free and unfeathered choice of the evidence not being bound by any actions which may have been taken place either by state police officers or by rulings of the state judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.701" offset="2510137">This is, as I will develop later, an example of attempted frustration of federal process merely by an abuse of state judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.017" offset="2547440">And I think that these facts provide the strongest practical argument for not applying a rigid exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.126" offset="2575862">On a rational of the Abatte decision, written for the Court by Mr. Justice Brennan, stated that the basic -- this dealt of course with double jeopardy, but the reasoning here on the Fifth and Fourth Amendments, I think, the reasoning is close and similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.783" offset="2638555">The basic dilemma was recognized over a century ago in Fox versus Ohio as it was there pointed out, if the States are free to prosecute criminal acts violating their laws and a result on state prosecution to bar federal prosecutions based on the same acts, federal law enforcement must necessarily be hindered.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.496" offset="2725386">And again, Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Feldman case, the Government here is not seeking to benefit by evidence which it extorted.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.361" offset="2760808">And that's certainly true here and in the later -- in the opinion for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.364" offset="2776795">Otherwise, the criminal law of the United States would be at the hazard of carelessness or connivance in some petty civil litigation in any state court, quite beyond the reach of the most alert watchfulness by the law officers of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.078" offset="2839698">Now, I'm reminded of the fact that in the Abatte opinion, in Footnote 7, in citing Courts of Appeals cases where the state prosecution did not bar subsequent federal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.946" offset="2887137">This Court, through Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion, first cited the Rios case, which is set for argument immediately following this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.545" offset="2917543">Now, in Rios, we had a situation in which there was a seizure which was ruled illegal by the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.828" offset="2946696">That, in the state trial under state procedure resulted in an acquittal without any possibility of appeal by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.415" offset="2985044">Now, then on -- on the Abatte case, the Federal Government would be free to prosecute without any question of jeopardy arising.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.739" offset="3014301">And here we have in Rios, a situation where the question is not under the Fifth Amendment but the question involves the same identical package of narcotics under the question of search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.054" offset="3059545">And so I submit that the logic, the same logic that applies to one applies to another that the Federal Government should not be barred in its use of the evidence obtained by the acts of state officers anymore under the Fourth Amendment than it would be barred by a state court acquittal based on the suppression of the evidence under the Fifth.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.318" offset="3152645">I think the reasoning is parallel.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.924" offset="3167065">Now, in -- it's been referred to in the petitioners' brief about the conviction of the District Attorney Langley here on a misdemeanor charge and his removal from office.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.857" offset="3222758">Again, I emphasize the Federal Government here nowise has taken any sides in the struggle in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.086" offset="3247731">And we think the wisdom is manifested.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.127" offset="3255881">But I want to call to the Court the opinion in State versus Langley, cited by petitioner in 323 Pacific and give you the circumstance of that conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.777" offset="3298513">Incidentally, in addition to the indictment and conviction of Langley, there was the indictment of seven other federal witnesses, four of them state officers who appeared and testified in federal courts, those indictments in coming -- coming just before or during the federal hearing on the motion to suppress and some of them being introduced in the record in this case for purposes of impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.432" offset="3385135">Nine of those other indictments resulted in a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.550" offset="3397569">Only one, I think, went to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.139" offset="3403943">There was an acquittal, all the rest were dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.867" offset="3414810">But now, as to Mr. Langley's conviction on a misdemeanor charge, that misdemeanor indictment was returned 10 days after the federal indictment in Elkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.511" offset="3457442">Secondly, Langley state trial in all of these facts are from the opinion in the Pacific reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.106" offset="3483773">Langley state trial began April the 9th, 1957, the very same day that Elkins motion to suppress evidence came on for hearing in the U.S. court.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.342" offset="3524733">Thirdly, while waiting in the state judges chambers for the trial, during a recess, Langley was arrested on two new state indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.089" offset="3567679">Fourthly, at same day, there were five column and eight column headlines in the Portland newspapers telling of the District Attorney's arrest while on the very day, he went to trial in the misdemeanor case on which he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.197" offset="3628178">Fifthly, television cameras were in the judges' chambers, photographed the arrest of Langley, and they were shown on three news programs that night, the day he went to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.727" offset="3670288">Sixthly, cameramen permitted -- were permitted to take pictures from within the courtroom railing during the testimony of petitioner Elkins against Langley contrary to Rule 69 of the state court rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.532" offset="3725458">Seventhly, a photographer was permitted to stand beside the jury box to take 25 still picture of Langley's defense counsel during his closing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.469" offset="3769240">Eighthly, the trial judge presiding in this trial was the same circuit judge who ruled that the seizure of these tapes of illegal and turn the tapes over to the State Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.694" offset="3822111">Now, that was the way which Mr. Langley was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.979" offset="3835277">I will add that this was a state trial of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.795" offset="3846562">It was affirmed by the Oregon Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.050" offset="3855548">Certiorari was sought and denied by this Court, which I take it merely means that for -- there were no federal question involved or there are more important cases demanding the Court's attention and in nowise, it constituted a ruling by this Court approving the opinion below in the state court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1051.071" offset="4307675">I submit respectfully that it supports our conclusion of the silver platter doctrine is a wise doctrine because it does not force the United States District Judge to examine into the legality or illegality of the seizure by state officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.252" offset="4372355">If the United States District Judge had inquired into all of these things, he might have been found as we -- as has been pointed out here by both counsel, he might have found horrible examples of misused of state process on both sides, and we take no sides in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.655" offset="4437974">And so we submit that not require -- the rule which doesn't require a United States District Judge to inquire into the actions of state officers or state judges is a wise policy in our federalism.</text>

            <text syncTime="1108.776" offset="4538493">Now, the people who were indicted, the witness, federal witnesses who were indicted but never convicted, were in addition to Langley, Lonergan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.135" offset="4579871">That was introduced in the trial as an impeachment at volume 7, pages 1301 to 1322, it was dismissed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1488.474" offset="6057253">Now, the evident shows that the defendant or petitioner Clark here was the former chief of police in St. Helens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.623" offset="6101870">And therefore, the chief of -- I heard there, the chief of police would be a logical source who know would something about Clark's activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1523.797" offset="6198523">Then the reporter, Brad Williams, came to Langley with the same information from different sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.289" offset="6228511">Then through the device of a telephone call placed by Williams with Langley listening in, he got from Chief Herder the details of this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1604.296" offset="6520560">He was in the courtroom and available but he was not called.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.674" offset="6538115">Now, Herder also says that he didn't know that Langley was listening in on the telephone and he tries to imply as the petitioner's counsel here that Langley never listened in on the call.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.142" offset="6583986">But again, only Langley and Williams would know if Langley ruined the extension telephone and Williams, the witness, who was available and could have been called was not called, and Langley's testimony that he did listen in, stands uncontradicted on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.389" offset="6648978">The Government didn't need him because there was no contradiction and Herder couldn't contradict him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1950.329" offset="7904737">In connection with the facts bearing on the execution of the affidavit, I think I can shorten matters by referring Your Honors to the reply brief in which we have set forth the evidence more fully and hence more accurately than it was presented by the prosecution either in writing or orally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.416" offset="7984985">The one point I do want to make is this, that because of the concession made by Mr. Luckey at the trial qua that for purposes of this matter, namely, the motion to suppress evidence, we may plead it the state seizure as illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.124" offset="8059904">There was no need to call Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.254" offset="8072338">There was no need to recall Langley for further impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.093" offset="8087698">It was conceded that it was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.576" offset="8097625">Indeed, in this reply brief, I refer at some length to unprinted portions of the State District Court hearing on that motion to suppress, and I have to do so because if I had any indication that at this juncture, the prosecution would try to show that this utterly invalid affidavit had some basis of validity, this would all have been in print and would have been much easier and that underscores the -- the lack of justification for the present attempt to change the basis on which this case was litigated through three courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.600" offset="8257808">Now, in the time remaining, I would like to address myself primarily to the heart of the silver platter doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.994" offset="8299395">In the heart of that doctrine is to what extent have subsequent events changed the state seizure aspect of the Weeks case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.445" offset="8337115">Weeks had two aspects, the federal seizure suppressed, the state seizure not suppressed and illegal state seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.435" offset="8373164">Now, insofar as the -- that state seizure in Weeks involved a violation of state law as qua state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.156" offset="8412035">It was the Burdeau v. McDowell, the non-constitutional aspect of Olmstead, namely, Gambino, namely, to what extent will evidence seized by means that shock the conscience or offend one's standards of propriety be admissible in federal court and that is one of the questions here, but there was another feature of Weeks, which, I think, was changed by Wolf against Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.655" offset="8530004">At the time of Weeks, the illegal state seizure was not considered to have violated the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.736" offset="8562291">Following Wolf versus Colorado, we have a different view, an illegal state search and seizure does violate the Federal Constitution because it is a denial of due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.722" offset="8622268">And then we have the problem, how shall such a violation be redress?</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.564" offset="8645674">Now, Wolf versus Colorado holds, as long as it's enforced, holds that if the State in a state prosecution provides for any other kind of redress be it criminal prosecution of the offending officers, civil action for damages, anything else, as long as the State provides in a -- in understate law redress for those aggrieved by illegal state seizures, the State is free to provide either that the evidence maybe admitted in its criminal prosecutions as in Wolf v. Colorado or else as is now the rule in California, as is the rule in practice in Oregon that it will not be admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.810" offset="8826650">Now, that is a purely state problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.582" offset="8837726">Then we have the federal problem, which wasn't Wolf v. Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.921" offset="8855071">We have the federal problem where there is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and evidence is obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.677" offset="8890075">May the fruits of that violation of the Fourteenth Amendment be admissible in a federal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.787" offset="8918497">And that, if I may translate it into an analogy, that is the difference between Schwartz versus Texas and Benanti against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.739" offset="8954337">And it is our position, and I emphasize this because, to my mind, it is the heart of this case, that a -- the federal court sets to redress all of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.542" offset="9005537">It has never until Mr. Wilkey spoke been a ground for lack of jurisdiction in a federal court that a proceeding there involved inquiry into the validity of the acts of the state judiciary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2529.794" offset="10222529">I do not think it makes for -- for adequate analysis of this problem with the responsibility to face -- face this to say that Wolf did decide what Judge Hastie decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="2565.433" offset="10365053">I am arguing now the implications from it but I will say this, if Your Honor pleases, that if -- if we have here the first inroad in the silver platter in the form of a Rochin situation, then this is that Rochin situation because Langley cited in his affidavit the source of my information is Herder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.653" offset="10441958">Langley set forth no supporting facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.172" offset="10476022">Langley did not, in that affidavit, rely on newspaper reporters to say “I have heard from faceless informers or my undercover people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.905" offset="10511026">He said the source of my information is Chief Herder, and that's all he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.301" offset="10532551">He gave no such supporting facts as were present in the affidavit in Jones, decided yesterday, And when Herder was on the state in two courts, he said “I don't know Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.247" offset="10580407">I've never talked to Langley.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.777" offset="10590438">And Langley admitted, page 62 of this record, that when he was “listening in on this telephone conversation”, he never advised Chief Herder that he was listening in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.669" offset="10642056">And that's why we say that never took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.589" offset="10653759">So that you have a state officer acting in bad faith, acting on the eve of a serious of three non judicial day sending people accompanied by newspaper reporters and the cameramen to break into a dwelling house in -- in the nighttime and then -- and then rummage around and seized things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.928" offset="10731081">Now, it seems to me -- maybe I shocked more easily now than I used to on -- in the past but that shocks me as much as Rochin does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.557" offset="10761592">I think it's just as bad to have the sheriff's break in as to have the stomach pump administered.</text>
