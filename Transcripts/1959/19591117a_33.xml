            <label>Ms. Bessie Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="25.471" offset="205302">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.447" offset="225155">The issues in this case concern two related exemptions from the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as those exemptions apply to the processes of frozen vegetable.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.842" offset="294745">The first section, first exemption is to that of Section 7 (c) which insofar is pertinent here, provides for an exemption of for not more than 14 work weeks in a calendar year, for employment of employees in a place where the employer is engaged in the first processing of or in the canning or packing of perishable of seasonal fresh fruits or vegetables.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.971" offset="419297">The other section involved is the Section 7 (b) (3) which provides another overtime exemption also for not more than 14 work weeks, but limited to 12 hours a day and 56 a week, for any employee employed in an industry found by the administrator to be of a seasonal nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.847" offset="502784">Now the issues under both of this -- these exemptions turn on the same language because the administrator made his seasonal finding under Section 7 (b) (3) in the same language as the first processing language of Section 7 (c) and determined that the exemptions could be accumulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.793" offset="594526">I'll say that the issues turn on this -- the same language at least all the issues that were raised in the court below, the whole issue was about the meaning of the language, the first processing of perishable, of seasonal fresh fruits or vegetables as used in the statute in Section 7 (c) and the identical language as used in Section 7 (b) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="151.668" offset="710092">For -- in the briefs of respondents and of amicus curiae, the National Association of Frozen Food Packers for the first time in this Court, a question is raised as to the validity of the administrator's seasonal finding under Section 7 (b) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="172.467" offset="793266">We have filed -- petitioners filed a reply brief directed primarily to this issue and if time permits, I will come in on it later, but since the issues presented by the -- decided below and tried below and presented in the petition for certiorari related solely to the meaning of this language, I'll address myself primarily to -- to that question, to -- to that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.837" offset="914683">The pertinent facts are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.716" offset="930252">As a matter of fact they were agreed to and incorporated by agreement in the District Court's pretrial order and by the way were the contentions and the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.105" offset="979780">I'm not making too much of the point of that because we -- we think that the -- the new contention is -- is without merits, certainly not well taken, but there is some question as to whether it is -- is properly -- whether it has not been foreclosed by the stipulation of the parties at the pretrial order.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.665" offset="1074030">The operations of -- of Oregon are described in these agreed facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.234" offset="1124289">If the -- they have an active season, they're engaged in -- in freezing and package -- and packaging corn and carrots and on mixed vegetables -- mixed frozen vegetables.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.396" offset="1180923">The active season for corn is about nine or 10 weeks from August 1st to August -- to October 10th and the active season for carrots is from about October 15 to December 1st, about six -- approximately six weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.796" offset="1258559">The process through which the -- the Oregon purchase that -- purchases the -- the crops during the harvested season and from nearby -- from nearby farm and it has -- has to immediately process them to stop the natural deterioration and -- and to put them into preservable form.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.022" offset="1371512">The process includes the cutting and cleaning and otherwise preparing for blanching, a partial cooking process.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.080" offset="1403695">And -- and this partial cooking process kills the enzymes which are responsible for our organic growth and the consequent rapid deterioration from natural causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.192" offset="1464090">Then the -- the blanched vegetables are put through the freezing units and quick-frozen.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.761" offset="1506408">After they've been quick-frozen in loose farm and this is done immediately on receipt of the -- of the vegetable, some of the vegetables are immediately packaged in consumer-sized containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.462" offset="1569207">Normally, however, only a small part of the vegetables -- the frozen vegetables can be so packed immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.636" offset="1605883">Less than a third of the corn for example was packaged during the active season in 1954, I believe it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.237" offset="1640364">The balance of the vegetables is packaged in large bulk, this is after they've been quick-frozen, in large bulk containers and placed in cold storage to be repackaged when the rest season ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.878" offset="1710895">This can be and is spread out over many months and may continue through the following May even.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.074" offset="1747675">In addition to the -- the freezing and the bulk packaging of the corn and carrots, Oregon also from December through -- I think in December and January for several months, mixed -- prepares a mixed vegetable, mixed frozen vegetable from its corn -- its own frozen corn and carrots and from -- mixed with peas and beans and lima beans, string beans and lima beans, which it purchases already frozen from other processors in Washington, California and Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.023" offset="1931473">The -- during the active harvesting season, Oregon employs approximately 300 employees -- production employees for the processing of the corn and reduces that number at the end of the season to about 20 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.000" offset="2015378">For carrots during the active season, about 40 production employees are employed and that's reduced to about 20 at the end of the active season.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.074" offset="2203669">There's some other evidence in the record which shows that the season for carrots is much less, but this must been the agreed statement, so I'm using those facts.</text>

            <label>Ms. Bessie Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="723.324" offset="2996642">The administrator's interpretation of this language of the exemptions, his long standing interpretation has been that this seasonal -- that it is a seasonal exemption limited to -- to the purpose of giving relief, the seasonal commodities during the peak season when prompt processing is essential for preservation of the crop and when the heavy influx during the short harvesting season can be handled only by working large quantities of labor for long hours and that it was not intended to exempt activities which could be extended around the year and where there was ample labor -- year round labor available to handle it.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.737" offset="3206353">This position as we'll later it show, has been the long standing interpretation of the administrator and has received the approval of -- of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.095" offset="3259747">So, it -- it is also, we believe, are clearly in accord with the original legislative purpose although we think it is unnecessary to examine very far into the original legislative purpose because it has clearly been approved by the subsequent legislative enactment of the 1949 Amendments under this Court's decisions construing those amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.664" offset="3390046">The purpose though, as explained in both the deliberations in the House and the Senate debates, was made plain that it was to be for these peak seasons to use the language of Senator Black, who was Chairman of the Senate Committee, the Committee was concerned with the necessity of excluding purely seasonal activities which cannot operate in any other way except by speeding up the work at a particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.151" offset="3524002">It was also equally concerned with not extending the exemption to related operations which didn't require of the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.858" offset="3570813">We think that the very fact that there is such a reduction in the number of employees at the close of the active season in this case, indicates that the purpose of the exemption does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.835" offset="3646673">There's other legislative history which we go into in our brief, particularly the -- the turning down of a -- an amendment which would have broadened this exemption, the so-called coffee amendment in the House, which was rejected by -- by the House for the narrower first processing language and for this -- it was specifically pointed out that the broader proposal, coffee proposal was -- was made because the first processing language might not include all operations leading to the final marketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.354" offset="3812812">Now, the trial court took the position that the -- that the only reasonable interpretation of the first processing of fresh seasonal perishable or seasonal fresh fruits, was the operations leading up to a final finished product for market.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.018" offset="3899434">We believe that the statute on its face, that the phrasing of the language of this statute, its context in -- in relation to other provisions of the statute, make it clear beyond doubt that the first processing as used in this section, did not -- did not intend and certainly it was not necessarily must be read as -- as going to the processing of a finished product for market.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.282" offset="4036524">Some of the other exemptions specifically so provide and a number of them use the term, “processing,” as distinguished from first processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.361" offset="4076857">So that the terms of the statute itself show that the first processing meant something different from processing, distributing and marketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.606" offset="4129834">Whether if there were any -- if the statute were less clear and the original legislative purpose were less clear, we submit that what has happened in Congress since then, has result any doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.035" offset="4187512">Congress was, at an early date, made aware of the administrative interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.785" offset="4210500">At the time of the -- of the 1949 Amendments, various proposals were made to amend both of these exemptions and they were -- hearings were held on them and although Congress did amend many other sections, it didn't amend either one of these exemptions except for -- in amount of detail not here applicable concerning buttermilk and left those sections intact and at that time, Congress was made fully aware of just how the administrator was interpreting Section 7 (c) and how he was applying Section 7 (b) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.665" offset="4377997">And we feel that apart from all of the other arguments of purpose in supporting the administrator's position in this case under both exemptions that the congressional approval at that time was sufficient to -- to resolve any possible doubt of its validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.528" offset="4481442">I want to call particular attention to the fact that the -- in these various industry members that appeared at that time and at the hearings and to consider when these various proposals to amend sections -- these sections were -- were before Congress, they appeared at the hearings to oppose any -- any changes in these sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.821" offset="4586663">And one of the representatives of the National Canners Association explicitly advanced the argument that they shouldn't be amended because the meaning of the exemptions had and I quote, “Become crystallized in administrative ruins, court decisions and industry understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.819" offset="4666598">And any unnecessary changes may open -- reopen the entire problem, disturb existing understanding of administrative interpretation and policy of enforcement and possibly put back the application of existing rules at least a decade.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.281" offset="4728456">Now, we have cited that, we haven't quoted it in our brief, but the National Frozen Food Packers Association also filed a statement at that time and they stated that they agreed and -- and approved of the statement of the National Canners Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.627" offset="4809853">The fact of the matter is that -- that nobody, none of the industry members wanted any changes in these provisions, because they felt it would upset the long standing administrative interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1408.886" offset="5738872">The industry -- the definition of -- in first place, the -- the section -- the exemption is clearly not self-operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.481" offset="5773249">It depends upon a finding by the administrator that the industry is of a seasonal nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.629" offset="5805850">An industry is defined in the Act to mean a branch, trade, business, no -- no, trade business industry, any branch thereof and we believe that this definition is clearly flexible enough to permit the administrator to take out the seasonal parts of an industry and find that that is the branch and that that is seasonal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.117" offset="5919848">And that is what he has done since the beginning of the operation of this Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1460.778" offset="5946493">Those determinations have generally been accepted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1469.931" offset="5983065">It's shown on their face that most of them were done in terms of the operations and as a matter of fact, the particular determination in this case was upon the -- the application of the industry members.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.629" offset="6409906">Counsel has given you a picture of these two exemptions with which we are concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.068" offset="6447626">I'd like to emphasize that they are two exemptions, they are not one exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.972" offset="6467271">We have first in our interpretation the rather broad exemption under 7 (b) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.507" offset="6493393">Our interpretation of that is that as a seasonal one, exemption based upon seasonality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.484" offset="6517321">It applies to an industry or a branch of an industry which is found to be found by the administrator as seasonal in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.674" offset="6554102">And if the administrator does find that an industry or branch of an industry is of a seasonal nature, it's our position that that broad exemption exempts all the related activities that are closely related to that industry or branch of an industry which is found to be seasonal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.445" offset="6649187">The other exemption with which we are concerned is a more narrower exemption, 7 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.747" offset="6682311">It is what we call a first processing exemption and it has to do and deals with directly, the particularly type of process that the employer is engaged in not generally, the type of industry that he's engaged in, but particular process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.816" offset="6762663">Therefore, by definition, it is a narrower exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="1681.617" offset="6829850">They have come on certainly a lot closer to be in a branch of an industry, if we included all the activities of first processing and if by our first processing, we would mean all those steps that are necessary from the reception of the vegetable to the final package of it, if that is first processing (Inaudible) be a branch of an industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1716.674" offset="6970075">Under this Act, all the steps from the reception of the corn to the final packaging of the corn and retail packages, if done, even in continuous process is considered to be first processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.781" offset="7030471">Now, that's why we raise this question of two exemptions and that the first processing as interpreted by the Government that is just freezing corn and put it in a 64-cubic foot bins and put them in a cold storage, simply couldn't be a branch of an industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.597" offset="7137782">Branch of an industry, we feel, should include all the steps that are necessary to have it -- give it some economic justification, some purpose, some end result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.018" offset="7175398">And certainly, there would be no end result or nothing accomplished simply by taking frozen corn and put it in cold storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.333" offset="7220746">Therefore, that -- that in our opinion is not a branch of an industry but rather it is a part of a process of a branch of an industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.511" offset="7261393">Now, so I should like to talk about exception 7 (c) that is the narrower one, as applied to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.432" offset="7313115">That is the first processing and at this plant that we're concerned with, there are two operating companies, both of them are parties to this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.389" offset="7360972">This litigation started out by the Secretary of Labor to restrain Ore-Ida Potato Products Company and Oregon Frozen Food Company, from violating certain terms of the Act and asked for an injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.790" offset="7430562">Before and during the trial, it became apparent and the Government proceeded that the -- all the activities, the Ore-Ida Potato Products were clearly exempt, no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.650" offset="7478000">Now, these two companies are affiliated companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.637" offset="7489912">They operate side by side from a parent company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.798" offset="7506526">Their freeze lines come down parallel, all the activities practically the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.398" offset="7528991">They have potatoes peeled, sliced and blanched and then either blanched in steam or oil and then frozen and packaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.860" offset="7578833">In the other lines we have identical situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.998" offset="7595342">We have the corn and the carrots coming in it's washed and peeled and diced, steam-blanched to kill the enzymes, frozen and then packaged to the extent that it can be packaged during the harvest season.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.609" offset="7657827">Now, either the correct interpretation of this operation would be that the primary purpose is to get all these corn in and freeze it in storage -- in bulk storage and then package it at leisure, if that was a correct outlet on this operation, then perhaps Government's position would be sound, but it's simply isn't that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.583" offset="7757720">The primary purpose -- the primary object of this corn operation is to get this corn in and get it into consumer sized package at the very earliest date possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.433" offset="7817070">If it is a large year with large production, then it is impossible to get it all in consumer sized package during the harvest season.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.972" offset="7867225">In a given date run, the lines operate all the products are put in to consumer sized package as physically possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.126" offset="7911842">The balance of it is put in large 64-foot -- cubic foot containers in the (Inaudible) and put in the next room which is the storage room, zero storage room.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.156" offset="7960012">That corn is brought out of the storage as fast as possible and put in the consumer sized package.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.416" offset="7984985">And if there's a lull in the operation of the day, if the corn doesn't come in at night and the night crew is working, then these pallets are pulled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.266" offset="8020407">It's all one operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.794" offset="8030542">And as soon as the corn crates coming in at the end of the season, well that operation is continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.679" offset="8062098">These pallets are pulled out of storage, taken to the packaging line, then are packaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.573" offset="8085713">Now, a great deal of emphasis has been put on the reduction and force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.303" offset="8100551">Well that's obvious and it's very natural.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.729" offset="8110268">It takes a great number of people to process this large quantity of corn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.370" offset="8136808">And is shocking the -- cutting the kernels from cob, or fixing the cobs and all that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.647" offset="8161991">It takes a lot of people to do that, but it doesn't take many people to run the package line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.258" offset="8184456">There are only two or three package lines and they accommodate approximately 20 people to the line, I think the reduction is to 40, which would indicate two lines.</text>
