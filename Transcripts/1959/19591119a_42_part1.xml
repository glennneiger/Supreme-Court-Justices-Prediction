            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 42, Local No. 8-6, Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union, Appellants, versus Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.384" offset="156923">Mr. Ratner you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mozart G. Ratner</label>
            <text syncTime="15.325" offset="164655">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.070" offset="175626">This case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Missouri, which sustained the constitutionality of Missouri's token seizure no strike law, the so-called King-Thompson Act as applied to the Laclede Gas Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.416" offset="253053">The Missouri Supreme Court found that all sides concede.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.405" offset="273011">Missouri's operations affect interstate commerce so that strikes against Laclede by its employees are governed by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.603" offset="317733">The question presented in this case is whether Missouri is encroached upon federal supremacy by bringing to bear upon a strike and upon strikes by employees of Laclede against that company, its own sovereign power to declare such strikes illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.037" offset="423476">This Court postponed the question of jurisdiction to the argument on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.661" offset="450017">So that after briefly summarizing the facts concerning the statute's operations and its application to the facts of this case which gave rise to the issue here, I will turn next to the question of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.760" offset="514382">In Missouri, the Governor derives power to seize a public utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.923" offset="559104">Upon investigation and the proclamation by him that a strike is threatened or has occurred, which threatens to interrupt the operation of the utility and thereby jeopardize the public interest, health and welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.532" offset="645517">Upon the proclamation of a seizure by the Governor, it becomes unlawful for the employees of the utility to continue their strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.001" offset="711346">Any labor organization which has called the strike comes under immediate obligation to call it off and officers of that labor organization are under a duty to cease supporting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.572" offset="793684">The most important fact about this case is the fact that the Supreme Court of Missouri itself has said that seizure by the Governor pursuant to the terms of the Missouri law is a token seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.043" offset="879574">That possession of the utility by the State is nominal only and not actual, that the utility company, a private company itself, continues to operate the utility on its own account, that the State of Missouri does not become the employer of the employees but rather the private company, in this instance, Laclede, remains the employer and the utility's employees remain the employees of a private employer.</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="230.182" offset="1024084">What about the liabilities for tort doing government state operation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mozart_g_ratner" startTime="234.989" stopTime="560.294">
            <label>Mr. Mozart G. Ratner</label>
            <text syncTime="234.989" offset="1043310">In Rider versus Julian, the Supreme Court of Missouri held that liability rests with Laclede and not with the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.160" offset="1084061">That is the most important fact of this case because it demonstrates that throughout the strike by Laclede's employees against Laclede or any utility's employees against any utility which is subject to this Act, the National Labor Relations Act remains fully and completely applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.987" offset="1179355">Your Honors know of course that Section 22 of the Taft-Hartley Act exempts the State and its political subdivisions from the category of employer and exempts equally State employees from the category of employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.685" offset="1254066">So, that National Law is not applicable to enterprises which are owned and operated by the State and State employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.471" offset="1301295">So, the Missouri Supreme Court's findings in Rider versus Julian and its authoritative construction of the state law removes entirely from the purview of this case that entire class of questions which could conceivably arise under other kinds of seizures statutes in which a State may be exercising its power of eminent domain to take over and operate on its own account a public utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.732" offset="1422294">It removes even the questions that might arise under statutes where attempt -- where a State attempts to make seizure of work as temporary matter to resolve the labor dispute, if Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.239" offset="1468374">If under the State statute, the State becomes the actual employer of the employees and operates the utility on its own account.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.149" offset="1504005">Those questions are simply not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.685" offset="1518111">Here, seizure is simply a talisman.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.078" offset="1539636">It is a magic formula which transforms a legal strike protected by federal law into an illegal strike which Missouri prohibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.865" offset="1598882">And what consequences does Missouri attach to that prohibition?</text>
            <text syncTime="378.626" offset="1617899">Severe ones indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.457" offset="1629184">The statute says that any employee who dares to continue with strike after the Governor has issued a seizure proclamation may be rehired by the public utility thereafter only as a new employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.636" offset="1693968">The statute, by its own force, takes from him all of his seniority rights that he may have built up under contracts and service over periods of 20 and more years.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.575" offset="1737644">And there are employees with this utility who's served for more than 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.452" offset="1757184">The statute levies on any labor organization which has the temerity to continue a strike after the Governor's proclamation of a seizure, a fine of $10,000 a day for everyday that they do not see to it that the strike has ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.623" offset="1845896">And the statute levies and every labor organization office a fine of $1,000 should he have the temerity to continue to support a strike after seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.962" offset="1907231">It's noteworthy too that under this statute, there is no provision that while seizure is in effect, the company must keep in effect any particular terms or conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.632" offset="1969925">For all that appears under this statute and under the proclamations that we have before us in this case, Laclede was free to impose after seizure any terms and conditions of employment that it might mean to laterally choose to impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.476" offset="2033246">And the statute does serve that immediately the labor dispute is settled, the Governor should terminate the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.624" offset="2081834">Now, of course the consequence of such a statute in operation upon a union is just this.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.046" offset="2107538">They're put in a dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.401" offset="2116942">They must either work indefinite on terms that the utility dictates or they must accept the collective bargaining contract as good as the utility offers and no better.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.027" offset="2175457">From that dilemma, there is under this statute, no escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.782" offset="2210461">The facts in this case are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.153" offset="2219969">A collective bargaining contract between the company and Laclede expired on the 30th of June of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.580" offset="2249644">You'll notice this is under federal law were given it under State law and on the 1st of July of 1956 a strike began.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.386" offset="2284962">Within a couple of days, Rogers, the Governor's deputy warned the union that it better had call of its strike or the Governor would invoke seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.889" offset="2322892">On the 5th of July, the Governor seized.</text>

            <text syncTime="563.769" offset="2358418">He issued a seizure proclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.395" offset="2372942">On the 9th of July a petition was filed for an injunction to prohibit continuation of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.044" offset="2419545">In addition, suits were filed then and shortly thereafter to collect the penalties that the Missouri Act provides for the employees did not call off their strike and the unions did not terminate upon the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.964" offset="2479208">In answer to the petition for injunction, the unions filed an answer and a petition for declaratory judgment alleging that the statute was unconstitutional, alleging that they were suffering irreparable injury by the effect to enforce it by its enforcement against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.566" offset="2533648">Alleging that the field had been preempted principally that in the Fourteenth and Thirteenth Amendment arguments as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.483" offset="2569279">The trial court first denied the motion for declaratory -- the petition for declaratory judgment and then amended its decree to grant it.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.698" offset="2602193">It found that the decision of this Court in the Amalgamated Bus Employees case involving the Wisconsin statute which bans strikes in public utilities and substituted compulsory arbitration for it was not controlling, it held that Missouri had a right to apply its seizure statute to this dispute and that its application was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.886" offset="2710967">It found specifically that the employees and the union had continued their strike after seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.440" offset="2741164">It found that that's -- the continuation was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.247" offset="2756315">It issued both, an injunction which is in terms perpetual, and a declaratory judgment saying that it was unlawful for the union and the employees to strike as long as the Governor's seizure order was in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="716.032" offset="2967489">I will in the course of this attempt to indicate that the distinctions are invalid, that they are figments of imagination really.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.342" offset="3000717">But, I think it's clear that the issue in this case was faced and squarely faced by this Court in the Amalgamated case.</text>

            <text syncTime="773.169" offset="3196008">Indeed, an amendment was proposed to overrule it and it was reject in the face of this Court's statement to Congress that if you're going to make a different rule for public utilities or local emergency disputes, it's up to Congress to make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.558" offset="3245641">Senator Holland proposed that Congress make it and Congress turned him down.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.497" offset="3265390">It is -- this is the most dramatic reaffirmation of -- of the preemption rule as it applies to public utilities and local emergencies disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.833" offset="3294751">In my opinion, it is possible to have had it.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.256" offset="3312410">But before turning again to the merits in more detail, we say that it was suggested below by amicus curiae though then not by appellee here that this case had somehow become moot, because following the seizure and the issuance of the injunction which compelled the employees and the union to go back to work, the union had caved in, in the face of the dilemma that the Missouri statute put it in and chose rather than to work on Laclede unilaterally imposed terms a contract on the terms that Laclede chose to offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.323" offset="3468622">And having chosen the contract, the statute then worked in accordance with its terms for the Governor gave up the seizure, the dispute was over, and so it's argued that the injunction by its own terms has expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.794" offset="3526510">We've chosen not to argue the question whether the injunction has in fact expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.240" offset="3548348">We read the declaratory judgment into the injunction as though the injunction too carries with it an implication that it prohibits strikes only during the period of seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.485" offset="3609266">But we think it perfectly clear that this case that raises that constitutional issue cannot possibly be moot, too much hinges upon resolution of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.982" offset="3655346">This is no abstract issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="981.581" offset="4029733">Your Honor I am not sufficiently familiar with Judge Sparkman's opinions in general to be able to read the implications so firmly.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.102" offset="4067767">I did not suspect that our clients could be assured that they would suffer no penalties as a result of their defiance for the seizure order in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.753" offset="4106428">And I think that in truth, Missouri's insistent on proceeding with the penalty actions and they are admittedly insisting on proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.171" offset="4156061">And their insistence which Judge Sparkman in his opinion took special no doubt that they will continue to apply this statute to future disputes makes it perfectly clear that they are not prepared to waive the enforcement or to concede the unconstitutionality of the seizure provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.122" offset="4223875">If they were, perhaps a different question would arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.998" offset="4239339">I think that even that would moot this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.886" offset="4250937">But as long as they are insisting on collecting the penalty, it cannot possibly moot it in my opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.007" offset="4275388">And I'm so sure partly because of the decision of this Court in the La Crosse Telephone case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.809" offset="4302660">For in that case, this Court passed upon the constitutionality of Wisconsin's attempt to subject La Crosse's labor relations to Wisconsin sovereign power in a proceeding that terminated with a mere certification which as this Court pointed out certainly does not of itself command action and is really the equivalent of a declaratory judgment for the particular labor organization represents the majority of employees and therefore occupies the status under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.071" offset="4435675">And it passed upon it in that case despite the fact that the employer could be compelled to bargain with that union only in a separate unfair labor practice proceeding that would have to be initiated by a charge that wasn't yet in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.474" offset="4505266">And despite the fact, and this is what's critical about that this Court in its opinion noted that the Wisconsin Court might never issue an unfair labor practice order against the employer if he refused to bargain with the union on the basis of that certification, because in the interim, the union might lose its majority and Supreme Court of Wisconsin hold the certification thereby in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.894" offset="4598993">A contingency which is the precise equivalent of possibility that the Missouri Supreme Court in the penalty action might hold that the penalty is itself unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.215" offset="4648208">The point to make is that under Missouri Law, the judgment of constitutionality which is made in this suit, in this declaratory judgment suit, is and will be res judicata in the penalty action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.771" offset="4722500">And the trial court in the penalty action has already so held, and we cite in our reply brief two Missouri cases that indicate the law that the trial court in the penalty suit followed and so hold.</text>

            <text syncTime="1202.241" offset="4912358">So, that there can be no question that we are dealing here with mere abstraction, hypothetical cases, interim adjudications, this is as final as it's possible for a judgment to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.614" offset="4969827">On the merits, this case is governed we think and clearly governed by the Bus Employee's case and its companion, United Gas in 340 U.S. 383.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.953" offset="5031163">The argument for the State principally turns as I read, “Upon an attempt to distinguish Amalgamated under theory that Amalgamated wasn't an emergency case and this one is.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.807" offset="5098559">But when they say that and when they hinge their argument upon it, they simply ignore the facts of the United Gas case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1280.937" offset="5227081">The United Gas, which is of the Bus Employees companion case and decided with it in one opinion, involved the strike which was called the Gas Company and Milwaukee, Wisconsin in October.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.509" offset="5289357">It's distinguished from this strike which was called against the St. Louis Gas Company in July.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.281" offset="5312449">It began at 6 o'clock in the morning on October the 5th, 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.832" offset="5334706">And in its opinion, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin had this to say about the consequences of that strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.020" offset="5363440">At 11:00 a.m. the public was advised to curtail consumption of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.887" offset="5382875">An appeal to consumers of gas was made to shut off the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.886" offset="5398967">The steam pressure dropped to zero in the boiler room, and no further pumping could be done with the main pumping facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.517" offset="5425403">The fires had to be pulled from the boilers reducing the steam pressure and all facilities had to be stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.780" offset="5450480">A minimum pressure in the distribution system was kept in order that the air would not get into the mains so as to prevent any explosions as due to the mixture of gas and air in the distribution system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.094" offset="5491754">The send-outs dropped to 25% of what they had been previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.917" offset="5511084">Low pressure in the system created a dangerous condition fraught with the possibility of infinite injury to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.740" offset="5546297">The public was advised by radio broadcast and through newspapers to shut off appliances and to shut off the service immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.913" offset="5575032">In the face of then because of those conditions, a temporary restraining order was issued in the United Gas case compelling the union immediately to call off its strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.789" offset="5614529">At 12:55 p.m. that order was signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.095" offset="5623724">It was served at 2 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.164" offset="5631979">And in discussing that order and its enforceability, in the propriety of contempt adjudication predicated upon it, the Supreme of Wisconsin had this to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.014" offset="5671476">“We impose the requirement of immediate compliance, ‘because of the seriousness of the situation already referred to resulting from the partial or complete stoppage of the essential service of furnishing gas to the public.'”</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.596" offset="5741798">And to leave no doubt upon the -- about the nature of the power which it was invoked to put an end to this threat to the public health and safety, the Wisconsin Court quoted at length from the decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court of the Telephone case and pointed out that it rested its decision but its judgment was not governed by this Court's decision in O'Brien upon the fact that here was at issue the public health, safety and welfare and that it was invoking the inherent power of the State to enjoin conduct which threaten that public health, safety and welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.769" offset="5906474">Now, of course, in its decision in the United Gas, Amalgamated, Bus case, this Court did not upset the finding of the Wisconsin Supreme Court that an emergency existed which justified the indication of the State's police powers if that were an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.339" offset="5976691">Nor did it challenge the bona fide, the Wisconsin's finding that health and safety of the public were actually affected and that there actually existed an emergency and that the State was relying upon its power to protect the public, health and safety and not upon a law regulating labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.984" offset="6051297">But nonetheless, it reversed Wisconsin's contempt conviction of the union officials who defied that restraining order, because it found that Wisconsin's power to act against the strike in that emergency had been superseded by the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.748" offset="6146382">Superseded by Congress's decision of the policy question namely, “Is it better in a free society to let strikes in public utilities run their course, to let collective bargaining go on in public utilities unhampered?</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.746" offset="6238333">Or is it more important that the people of the community be protected against the consequences of such strikes, which may imperil their health and safety?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.639" offset="6297893">And Congress resolved that policy question said this Court, clearly because it looked among other things not only to the proposals which had made in Taft-Hartley to outlaw strikes in public utilities on the grounds that they were deleterious for the public welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.849" offset="6370722">But upon Senator Taft's explanation of why it was that Congress had repudiated all kinds of suggestions for limiting, curtailing and emasculating the right to strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.200" offset="7024201">That question this Court's (Inaudible) and that question this Court rejected unnecessarily so because the underlying thesis of its opinion was that the policy considerations which lead to the exercise or non-exercise of that kind of power were weighed by Congress and that to allow the State to really weigh them would be to allow the State to repudiate and reverse Congress's judgment on that policy issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.302" offset="7172577">The shorter the matter is, as this Court summed it up in the second Government, in the -- in the Bus case -- I'm sorry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1800.319" offset="7304652">Let me illustrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.065" offset="7311653">Suppose that we had this strike in Illinois or this strike in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.184" offset="7348120">Illinois would not issue an injunction against this strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="1821.250" offset="7388348">To allow Missouri statute to stand to enjoin this strike would result in a diversity of treatment of identically situated department, Public utility workers in Illinois continuing their strike and public utility workers in Missouri being enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.037" offset="7459506">This is precisely the judgment not to allow that kind of diversity which this Court in Guss held that Congress made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.683" offset="7506108">And there's no distinction drawable in my view on the ground that so they hold leads a situation that might otherwise need a remedy, remedy of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.356" offset="7556786">Well, that is precisely what this Court held in Guss that the consequence of a so-called “no man's land” is to leave conduct which reasonable people might think should not be allowed to continue to go unchecked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.695" offset="7634108">Now, Congress squarely faced that problem in Landrum-Griffin, faced with this Court's decision in Guss, and faced with the rationale of the second Garmon opinion which holds that a State may not lay its hands even on unprotected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.422" offset="7725014">Congress tackled the preemption problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.641" offset="7745912">And it dealt it with as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.702" offset="7758137">It said, “We retain uniformity, full and complete uniformity as under the second Garmon case to the extent that federal law applies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1952.275" offset="7912469">The amendment to Section 10 (a) which is set out in our brief demonstrates that Congress was fully aware of the implications of this Court's trilogy in the first Garmon, Guss, and Fairlawn decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3385.052" offset="13643630">And as much as this Court reserves the question of the jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits, I will first address myself to the proposition of whether or not this is a moot case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.212" offset="13696188">And as much and insofar as I am aware and insofar as counsel for the appellant has considered the matter, the problem of jurisdiction if any seems to arise out of mootness if mootness does exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.802" offset="13754598">Now, the facts of the situation of this, this cause of action was brought on July the 9th, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.662" offset="13786049">The strike (Inaudible) had begun on June -- July the 1st, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.590" offset="13809768">On July 13th, 1956, after a trial of some three days duration, the Circuit Court issued an injunction against continuation of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.157" offset="13863999">In August 1956, some month after the injunction had been issued a new agreement was entered into between Laclede and the unions here concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.148" offset="13927946">On October the 31st, 1956, the Governor of Missouri terminated the seizure of the Laclede Gas Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.913" offset="13963055">Now we say that these circumstances bring this matter within the purview of Harris versus Battle involving a similar situation under a similar Virginia statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.568" offset="14021674">We say this brings us within the purview of the Montgomery Ward case in which the Montgomery Ward Company had been seized under the War Powers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.052" offset="14071620">And when the seizure had been terminated by the time the case got to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.883" offset="14094921">And the held the case was moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.118" offset="14103803">The case of Commercial Cable Company versus Burleson which involved the seizure of the telegraph companies in the First World War.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.622" offset="14133896">At the time the case reached this Court, the seizure had been terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.022" offset="14151450">The Court held the case was moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.922" offset="14159078">The Court in Burleson, specifically refused to continue to consider the case on the theory that there is a possibility of recurrence of such a seizure, which is exactly the point raised here that there is a possibility of recurrence of -- of seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.896" offset="14230967">Now, the appellants have also claimed that they are in jeopardy that there the seniority rights of the employees of Laclede are in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.083" offset="14275688">This strike occurred in July 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.716" offset="14298258">This is October 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.249" offset="14312364">To date, absolutely no action has been taken to deprive any of the employees of Laclede of any seniority rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.301" offset="14364609">No action is pending for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.888" offset="14374954">I know of no action that is contemplated for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.754" offset="14390418">So, I say that any talk about jeopardy to seniority rights is talking about an imaginary thing and not a real threat.</text>

            <text syncTime="5513.709" offset="22158190">Now, I think if the statement of Chief Justice has -- the statement of Senator Taft is analyzed, I think it will be seen that his statement refers to statutes such as that involved in the Amalgamated case, that is, a statute which prohibits strikes absolutely, which substitutes compulsory arbitration or collective bargaining, which is what the Wisconsin Act did and which is not what the Missouri Act does.</text>
            <text syncTime="5555.637" offset="22325896">The Missouri Act prohibits strikes only in the event of seizure to protect the public health and welfare.</text>

            <text syncTime="5579.222" offset="22420250">And I think close reading of Senator Taft's statement indicates that that is the kind of Act which he was talking about, because he spoke of a process of the Government fixing wages and that they didn't want to enact a proposal whereby one of the parties would think they might get a better deal in the compulsory arbitration which may be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="5608.644" offset="22537906">He was speaking of compulsory arbitration and the fixing of wages by Government action, which is not what we have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="6406.314" offset="25728606">I do not want it understood that it is in that, because I fear a decision of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="6425.384" offset="25804884">I -- I think you can see in the Landrum bill that what Congress was talking was strictly these problems which had arisen in the field of unfair labor practices and matters of that nature, which the -- the no man's land situation that arose in the -- after the Guss case and related cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6451.767" offset="25910418">I do not think that the fact that the Congress in that act saw fit to indicate that the states may have some greater authority in that field than decisions of this Court have held, indicate in any -- to any extent that the Congress necessarily intended that any other limitations upon state authority be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="6487.190" offset="26052106">In other words, they were talking there about unfair labor practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="6506.711" offset="26130265">And I say that the -- the history, the legislative history I think affords no basis for saying that the Missouri statute is necessarily in conflict with the federal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6523.006" offset="26195362">I think that to determine the validity -- the present validity of the Missouri statute, the Court must return to the principle which it has so often enunciated that state action for the protection of the public health and public welfare is not to be considered to be abrogated by an act of Congress in the absence of clear and compelling direction to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6558.478" offset="26337259">And I say to this Court that we find no such clear and compelling direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6566.713" offset="26370173">Any compelling directions to that effect must I think go back to the statement of Senator Taft which was provided on the Amalgamated case and incidentally --</text>
